"To determine the amount Janet makes at the farmers' market, we must first calculate the number of eggs she has available for sale. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and utilizes 4 eggs for baking muffins, resulting in a total of 7 eggs used. 

To find the number of eggs remaining, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 

Therefore, she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for a robe, we must consider the amount of blue and white fiber needed. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. The amount of white fiber required is half that of the blue fiber, which is 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt.

Therefore, the total number of bolts required is the sum of the blue and white fiber, which is 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the profit made by Josh, we must first calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house was $80,000, and the repairs increased its value by 150%.

To find the new value, we apply the percentage increase to the original value:
New value = Original value + (Original value * 150%)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

The total cost of the house is the sum of the original price and the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

Therefore, the profit made by Josh is $70,000.

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we must first calculate the total distance he runs in a single sprint session. Since James runs 3 sprints, each consisting of 60 meters, the total distance for a single session is calculated as follows:

3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Next, we must consider the frequency of James' sprint sessions. He runs 3 times a week. To find the total distance run in a week, we multiply the distance of a single session by the number of sessions:

180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we must first calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon. 

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

Therefore, the correct answer is 20 cups."
"To determine the total cost of the glasses, we must first understand the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, and each subsequent glass costs 60% of the previous glass's price.

The cost of the first glass is $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8, which is 0.6 * $1.8 = $1.08. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time.

This pattern indicates a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 0.6. The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by: an = a1 * r^(n-1), where a1 is the first term and r is the common ratio.

We can use this formula to find the cost of each glass. The first glass is $5, the second is $3, the third is $1.8, the fourth is $1.08, the fifth is $0.64, the sixth is $0.384, the seventh is $0.2304, the eighth is $0.13824, the ninth is $0.082944, the tenth is $0.0497664, the eleventh is $0.02986584, the twelfth is $0.017949504, the thirteenth is $0.0107949304, the fourteenth is $0.00648696024, the fifteenth is $0.003876582144, the sixteenth is $0.0023259456896.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.0107949304 + $0.00648696024 + $0.003876582144 + $0.0023259456896 = $23.016

The total cost is $23.016."
"In this scenario, we are presented with a problem involving the number of sheep in three cities: Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle. We are given the following information:

1. Seattle has a fixed number of sheep, which is 20.
2. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

To determine the total number of sheep, we must first calculate the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse. Since Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse, which is twice the number of sheep in Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle: 160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260.

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To determine the total time it takes to download the file, we must first calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and then the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, we calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the 200 GB file. This is done by multiplying 200 GB by 0.4, which equals 80 GB. Given that Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. This is done by multiplying 200 GB by 0.6, which equals 120 GB. Given that Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 120 GB is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

However, we must also account for the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

The total time is calculated as follows: 40 minutes (to download the first 40% of the file) + 20 minutes (to install the updates) + 60 minutes (to download the remaining 60% of the file) = 120 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we must calculate the distance he traveled in each segment of his trip and then subtract the total distance from the initial distance.

First, we calculate the distance John traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Next, we calculate the distance John traveled in the first 2 hours of the return trip in standstill traffic:

Distance = Speed * Time
Since he is not moving, the distance is 0 miles.

Then, we calculate the distance John traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

Finally, we calculate the distance John traveled in the remaining 2 hours of the return trip at 80 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 160 = 175 miles

Now, we calculate the total distance John traveled in the 4 hours:

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles

Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

However, since John is now back home, we need to consider the distance he has traveled in the 4 hours. To find the distance from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 3 hours and the distance he traveled in the return trip.

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles

Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles."
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we must first calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours worked at her regular rate of $10 per hour. This is calculated as 40 hours * $10 per hour = $400.

Next, we must calculate her earnings for the overtime hours. Since Eliza worked a total of 45 hours and the first 40 hours are considered regular hours, the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. Therefore, her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 hours * $12 per hour = $60.

To find her total earnings for the week, we add her regular earnings and overtime earnings: $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we must calculate the downloads for each month and sum them together.

The first month's downloads were 60.

The second month's downloads were three times the first month's downloads, which equals 3 * 60 = 180.

To find the third month's downloads, we must calculate 30% of the second month's downloads and subtract that amount from the second month's total. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. Subtracting this from the second month's total gives us 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"In the matter of Toula's pastry purchases, we have a straightforward calculation to determine the total cost. 

First, we calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen at $68 per dozen equals $204. 

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen at $80 per dozen equals $160.

Lastly, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen at $55 per dozen equals $330.

To find the total cost, we add these amounts together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

Therefore, the total cost of Toula's pastry purchases is $694."
"To determine when Carlos will start earning money on the lemon tree, we must consider the total cost of the tree and the revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a revenue of $10.5 per year. However, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree annually, reducing the net revenue to $7.5 per year.

To calculate the break-even point, we divide the initial cost by the net revenue:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.5 (net revenue) = 12 years

This indicates that it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself. Since the tree starts generating revenue in the first year, we must consider the first year as the year it begins earning money.

Therefore, the correct answer is that it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself, and it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had, we must analyze the sequence of sales and remaining inventory.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This implies that she had 2/3 of her vacuum cleaners remaining after the sale at the green house.

She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with 2/3 of the initial amount minus 2 vacuum cleaners.

The next sale occurred at the orange house, where she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners. This means she sold 1/2 of (2/3 of the initial amount minus 2), leaving her with 1/2 of (2/3 of the initial amount minus 2).

Let's represent the initial number of vacuum cleaners as ""x"". After the sale at the orange house, Melanie had 1/2 of (2/3x - 2) vacuum cleaners remaining.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 1/2 of (2/3x - 2) = 5.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2/3x - 2 = 10.

Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation: 2/3x = 12.

To isolate x, we multiply both sides by 3/2: x = 18.

Therefore, Melanie initially had 18 vacuum cleaners.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we must first calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 20 * 0.2 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 16 * 0.25 = 4 students.

Therefore, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the optimal purchase for the merchant, we must consider the potential increase in value of each item. 

The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, and the electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%. 

To calculate the potential increase in value for each item:
- Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
- Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Based on these calculations, the merchant should choose the jewelry, as it has the higher potential increase in value.

The profit would be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"In the context of this problem, we are dealing with two trains traveling in different directions, which necessitates the application of the Pythagorean theorem to determine the total distance covered by each train.

To calculate the total distance, we must first understand that the two legs of the journey are perpendicular to each other, forming a right-angled triangle. The westward journey of 80 miles and the northward journey of 150 miles serve as the two legs of this triangle.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the total distance covered by each train as follows:

Total distance = √(80^2 + 150^2)
Total distance = √(6400 + 22500)
Total distance = √28900
Total distance = 170 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles."
"To determine Jill's annual salary, we must first calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately, and then add them together.

Jill's earnings from teaching can be calculated as follows: 
- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 35 * 50 = 1750
- Annual earnings from teaching: 1750 * $20 = $35,000

Jill's earnings from coaching can be calculated as follows: 
- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 15 * 50 = 750
- Annual earnings from coaching: 750 * $30 = $22,500

Therefore, Jill's total annual salary is the sum of her earnings from teaching and coaching: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we must first calculate the total number of days in that time period. Since there are 7 days in a week, 4 weeks will comprise 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Next, we must calculate the total number of eggs Claire will consume over this period. As she makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she will eat 3 eggs per day. Therefore, in 28 days, she will consume 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

To convert this total to dozens, we divide the number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen. Thus, 84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

Therefore, Claire will consume 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the speed at which Marissa must walk the remaining distance, we must first calculate the total time she has available to complete the hike. Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike, we can find the total time by dividing the total distance by her desired average speed.

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. Therefore, she has 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour remaining to walk the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles. To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

Therefore, the speed at which Marissa must walk the remaining distance is 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we must first calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in the original mixture is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

However, 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, resulting in a loss of 1/3 of the water from the orange drink, which is (1/3) * 6.67 = 2.22 liters.

The remaining amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 - 2.22 = 4.45 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining mixture is 4.45 + 9 = 13.45 liters.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, the remaining amount of non-water liquid is 24 - 13.45 = 10.55 liters.

To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the amount of water in the 10.55 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. 
Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 10.55 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 10.55 = 3.51 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 10.55 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 10.55 = 4.22 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 13.45 + 3.51 + 4.22 = 21.18 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.18}$"
"To determine the age of Raymond's son, we must first establish the current age of Raymond. Since Samantha is 31 years old and Raymond was born 6 years prior to her birth, it follows that Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Given that Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we can calculate the number of years that have elapsed since the son's birth by subtracting his birth year from his father's current age. This yields 25 - 23 = 2 years.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we must analyze the transactions with his customers.

First, we consider the initial 3 customers who each purchased one DVD, resulting in a total of 3 DVDs sold.

Next, we examine the subsequent 2 customers who each purchased 2 DVDs, leading to an additional 4 DVDs sold.

Since the last 3 customers did not make any purchases, we do not need to account for any additional DVDs sold.

Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs."
"To determine the extent to which a candle will be diminished in length, we must first establish the duration of its burning period. In this instance, the candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which equates to a total of 4 hours.

Given that the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can calculate the total diminution in length by multiplying the rate of melting by the duration of burning.

Total diminution = rate of melting * duration of burning
Total diminution = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total diminution = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the original price of the book, we must first understand the relationship between the original price and the discounted price. The discounted price is the result of a 25% reduction from the original price. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Original Price - (Discount Percentage * Original Price) = Discounted Price

Given that the discounted price is $19.50 and the discount percentage is 25% or 0.25, we can set up the equation:

Original Price - (0.25 * Original Price) = 19.50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.75 * Original Price = 19.50

To find the original price, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

Original Price = 19.50 / 0.75

Original Price = 26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased, excluding the pizza boxes. The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 = $15, and the cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Now, we must subtract the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount Marie paid to find the cost of the pizza boxes. The total amount Marie paid is $50, so the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box to find the number of boxes. The number of pizza boxes is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on the clothing items, we must calculate the cost of each item and then sum them together.

First, we calculate the cost of the shorts: 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pants: 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.

Lastly, we calculate the cost of the shoes: 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each is 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, we add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Therefore, the total amount Mishka spent on the clothing items is $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To determine the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we must first calculate the total number of cartons she will purchase. Given that each carton contains 15 servings and she consumes one serving per night, we can calculate the total number of cartons by dividing the total number of days (60) by the number of servings per carton (15).

60 days / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton ($4.00).

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend a total of $16.00 on ice cream.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to analyze the information provided. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles.

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

Therefore, the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops is 15 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"In this scenario, we are presented with a problem involving the cost of a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. The less expensive pair of heels costs $33, and the more expensive pair costs twice as much, which is $66. 

We are informed that the combined cost of the two pairs of heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots. This information can be used to establish an equation to determine the cost of the boots.

Let's denote the cost of the boots as B. The equation representing the situation is B = 33 + 66 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $94.

The final answer is: $94"
"To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, we must first establish the current age ratio between Darrell and Allen. The given ratio is 7:11, indicating that for every 7 units of Darrell's age, Allen is 11 units older.

Let's denote the common multiplier as x. Therefore, Darrell's age can be expressed as 7x, and Allen's age can be expressed as 11x.

Given that their combined age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms, we get 18x = 162. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 18, yielding x = 9.

Now that we have the value of x, we can determine Allen's current age by substituting x into the expression for his age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, the correct answer is 109."
"To determine the average guess of Gunter's friends, we must first calculate the individual guesses. 

The first friend estimates the number of jelly beans to be 80. 
The second friend's estimate is 20 more than half of the first friend's estimate: 80 / 2 = 40, 40 + 20 = 60.
The third friend's estimate is 25% more than the first friend's estimate: 80 * 0.25 = 20, 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we calculate the total number of guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total number of guesses by the number of friends: 240 / 3 = 80.

Therefore, the average guess is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we must first calculate the daily time commitment. Each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day. With 10 dogs in his care, the total daily time commitment is as follows:

Daily time commitment = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Daily time commitment = 10 * 0.5
Daily time commitment = 5 hours

To find the weekly time commitment, we must multiply the daily time commitment by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

Weekly time commitment = Daily time commitment * 7
Weekly time commitment = 5 * 7
Weekly time commitment = 35 hours

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his dogs.

The final answer is: 35"
"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we must first establish the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins. It is given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. Therefore, G = S + 30.

We also know that the total number of coins is 110, which is the sum of the silver and gold coins. This can be expressed as S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the equation S + G = 110, we get S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combining like terms, we have 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides yields 2S = 80.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that S = 40.

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can determine the number of gold coins by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the number of jewels Siobhan possesses, we must carefully analyze the given information.

First, we establish the known quantity: Raymond has 40 jewels. 

Next, we calculate the number of jewels Aaron possesses. Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we must first determine half of Raymond's jewels. Half of 40 is 20. 

Adding 5 to this amount yields 20 + 5 = 25 jewels for Aaron.

Now, we must consider the relationship between Siobhan and Aaron's jewels. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total to find Siobhan's total: 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

Therefore, the correct answer is 23 jewels."
"To determine the total points scored by Mike, we must first calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To calculate this, we find 25% of 4 points, which is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point. Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total expenditure on yogurts over a 30-day period, we must first calculate the total number of yogurts consumed. Given that Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, the total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days is 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Next, we need to determine the cost of the yogurts. Since they are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00, we must calculate the number of sets purchased. This can be done by dividing the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per set: 60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Now, we can calculate the total expenditure by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set: 15 sets * $5.00 per set = $75.00.

Therefore, the total expenditure on yogurts over a 30-day period is $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John has left, we must first calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. Since he sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is 8 * 20 = $160.

John also had $5 left after buying the video games. This means he spent a total of $195 - $5 = $190 of the money he made from selling the Lego sets.

Since he spent $190 of the money he made from selling the Lego sets, we can calculate the amount of money he used from his own funds to buy the video games. This is $190 - $160 = $30.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $30. Since each Lego set is sold for $15, the number of Lego sets he sold with his own money is $30 / $15 = 2.

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. Therefore, he must have sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 13 - 2 = 11 sets with the money from the Lego sales.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine John's running speed, we must first calculate the total time he spends running each week. 

John runs 3 hours on the first day. For the remaining two days, he runs half the amount of the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

Total running time per week = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we must multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time.
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

Therefore, John's running speed is 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To determine the total distance Dana can travel in six hours, we must first establish her walking and running speeds. Given that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour and it is half as fast as her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Consequently, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour, as it is one-fourth of her running speed.

Dana spends two-thirds of the time walking and one-third of the time running. Therefore, she spends 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking and 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running.

The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we must analyze the given information. 

First, we establish the age of Suzy's iPhone as 1 year. 

Next, we consider the relationship between Ben's and Suzy's iPhones. It is stated that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Lastly, we examine the relationship between Brandon's and Ben's iPhones. It is stated that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Consequently, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"In this scenario, we are dealing with a hypothetical situation involving a dragon and a hero, Polly, who possesses a unique ability to throw a gold javelin with the aid of a sapphire gemstone. The gemstone amplifies Polly's throwing distance, allowing her to reach the dragon from a greater distance.

The dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet. Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. However, when she holds the gemstone, her throwing distance triples. 

To determine the maximum distance from the dragon at which Polly can still hit it with the javelin, we must calculate her throwing distance with the gemstone. 

Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the javelin.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 200 feet"
"In this scenario, we are dealing with a straightforward mathematical problem involving the distribution and consumption of apple pies at a fireman's luncheon. To determine the number of pieces taken by the guests, we must first calculate the total number of pieces available for consumption.

Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

Next, we need to subtract the number of pieces remaining from the total to find out how many pieces were taken by the guests. There were 14 pieces remaining, so the calculation is as follows: 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces.

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine the permissible amount of chips, we must first calculate the remaining daily calorie allowance. Given a daily target of 2000 calories and a current consumption of 1800 calories, the remaining allowance is 200 calories.

Next, we need to establish the calorie content per serving of chips. According to the information provided, a serving of chips contains 250 calories. To find out how many servings can be consumed within the remaining calorie allowance, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag of chips contains 5 servings, we can calculate the permissible weight of chips by multiplying the number of servings by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

Therefore, the permissible amount of chips is 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we must first calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of the candles and the total cost incurred in producing them.

The total revenue is calculated by multiplying the number of candles sold by the price per candle. In this case, Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each.

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost incurred by Charlie in producing the candles. The cost of supplies includes the cost of beeswax and wicks. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 per pound * 2.

Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $10.00 per pound * 2
Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $20.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

Therefore, the net profit from selling 20 candles is $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we must first calculate the number of articles she wrote each day. 

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This equates to 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

The total number of articles written in 3 days is 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we must consider the total number of Post-it notes she had at the end of the day. This can be calculated by adding the initial number of Post-it notes, the number of Post-it notes in the package, and subtracting the number of Post-it notes used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'. The equation can be set up as follows:

Initial Post-it notes + Post-it notes in the package - Post-it notes used = Post-it notes remaining

"To determine the total amount spent on ties, we must first establish the number of blue ties and the cost of red ties.

John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. Therefore, the number of blue ties is 200 / 40 = 5.

As per the given information, John purchases twice as many red ties as blue ties. Consequently, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This implies that the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie, which is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

The total cost of the red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

To calculate the total amount spent on ties, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

Therefore, the total amount spent on ties is $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained from the wire, we must first convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, a 4-foot wire would be equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Next, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces obtained. In this case, the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

Thus, Tracy obtained 8 pieces from the wire.

"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we must first calculate the total number of eggs produced per week. Given that his chickens produce 252 eggs per day, we can multiply this daily output by the number of days in a week.

The total number of eggs produced per week is 252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week.

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we must convert the total number of eggs to dozens. This is achieved by dividing the total number of eggs by 12.

1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, we can calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings by multiplying the number of dozens by the price per dozen.

147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

Therefore, Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales are $294."
"To determine the total time Tom spent traveling, we must first calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spent traveling back.

The distance from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours. Since Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, the distance is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

The time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour is 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Now, we need to find the time it took to travel back. The distance is the same, 30 miles. Since Tom's ship can travel at 6 mph, the time it took to travel back is 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

The total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.

Therefore, the total time Tom spent traveling is 8 hours.

"To determine the better price for purchasing flowers, we must first calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

"In the context of a sports team's performance, the scenario presented involves a straightforward algebraic equation. We are given that a football team played a total of 22 games and won 8 more games than they lost.

To determine the number of games the team won, we can establish a relationship between the number of games won (W) and the number of games lost (L). The equation representing this relationship is W = L + 8.

Additionally, we know that the total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost, which can be expressed as W + L = 22.

By substituting the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation, we get (L + 8) + L = 22.

Simplifying this equation, we combine like terms to obtain 2L + 8 = 22.

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation yields 2L = 14.

Dividing both sides by 2 results in L = 7.

Now that we have determined the number of games lost, we can calculate the number of games won by adding 8 to L: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we must first calculate the total number of years he has been vacationing. Gene is currently 34 years old and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. Therefore, he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations per year, we can calculate the total number of quilt blocks by multiplying the number of years he has been vacationing by the number of vacations he goes on per year: 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a series of events where an alarm rings multiple times. To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we must calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and then sum those values.

The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which equates to 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, which is 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

Therefore, the total number of times the alarm rang is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we must consider the company's policy of increasing salaries by 10% of the initial salary every year for employees who have stayed in the company for five years.

The initial annual salary is $600. To calculate the salary after five years, we apply the 10% increase for each year.

Year 1: $600 + (10% of $600) = $600 + $60 = $660
Year 2: $660 + (10% of $660) = $660 + $66 = $726
Year 3: $726 + (10% of $726) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 4: $798.60 + (10% of $798.60) = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46
Year 5: $878.46 + (10% of $878.46) = $878.46 + $87.85 = $966.31

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next three years. The 10% increase is applied to the salary after five years.

Year 6: $966.31 + (10% of $966.31) = $966.31 + $96.63 = $1062.94
Year 7: $1062.94 + (10% of $1062.94) = $1062.94 + $106.29 = $1169.23
Year 8: $1169.23 + (10% of $1169.23) = $1169.23 + $116.92 = $1286.15
Year 9: $1286.15 + (10% of $1286.15) = $1286.15 + $128.62 = $1414.77

The final answer is: $1414.77"
"To determine the number of copies Harald sold, we must first establish the relationship between the sales of Harald and Marilyn. It is given that Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Therefore, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. This can be expressed as:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combining like terms, we get:

11H = 88,000

To find the value of H, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To determine the total cost of gift bags for Christina's birthday party, we must first calculate the number of guests who will actually attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests do not show up, we can find the number of attending guests by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

The total number of invited guests is 16. To find 1/4 of 16, we multiply 16 by 1/4, which is equivalent to dividing 16 by 4. 

16 / 4 = 4

Since 4 guests do not show up, we subtract this number from the total number of invited guests to find the number of attending guests.

16 - 4 = 12

Now, we need to calculate the total number of gift bags required. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest. To find the total number of gift bags needed, we multiply the number of attending guests by 0.75.

12 * 0.75 = 9

Each gift bag costs $2. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

9 * $2 = $18

Therefore, the total cost of gift bags for Christina's birthday party is $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad required for the dinosaur picnic, we must consider the consumption patterns of both adults and children.

Adult dinosaurs are expected to consume 10 pounds of potato salad each. Given that there are 20 adults attending the picnic, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Children, on the other hand, will consume half the amount of potato salad as adults. Since there are 5 children attending the picnic, the total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 * (10 / 2) = 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

To ensure that there is enough potato salad for everyone, we must calculate the total amount required by adding the amounts for adults and children. Therefore, the total amount of potato salad needed is 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: 225"
"To determine the total number of pets the three individuals possess, we must first establish the number of pets each has. 

Cindy is stated to have four pets. 

Marcia is noted to have two more pets than Cindy, which would be four plus two, equating to six pets.

Jan, on the other hand, has three times the number of pets as Marcia, which is six. Therefore, Jan has eighteen pets.

To calculate the total number of pets, we must add the number of pets each individual has: four (Cindy) plus six (Marcia) plus eighteen (Jan).

The total number of pets is 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To determine the age of Jackson, we must analyze the given information. 

First, we establish the age of James, which is 10 years old. It is also stated that James is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, Corey's age is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Next, we are informed that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Consequently, Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, we are told that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Based on the information provided, the age of Jackson is 4 years old.

"To determine Gerald's new time, we must first establish his original time. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, we can calculate Gerald's original time by adding 2 seconds to Lee's time. 

Given that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Next, we must calculate the improvement in Gerald's speed due to his new diet. A 10% improvement means that his new time will be 90% of his original time, since 100% - 10% = 90%. 

To find 90% of 40, we multiply 0.9 by 40, which equals 36. 

Therefore, Gerald's new time is 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we must first establish the number of cats. Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as 2 * 60 = 120.

Next, we need to find the combined number of dogs and cats, which is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

The final answer is: 348"
"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we must first establish the total number of girls within the student population. 

Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows: 2/5 * 200 = 80. Consequently, the number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120.

Next, we need to calculate the number of girls who are part of the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we can calculate this as 2/3 * 120 = 80.

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls: 120 - 80 = 40.

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we must first calculate the number of hours James slept. 

James slept 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. Since Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James' hours as follows: (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find the difference in hours slept between Harry and James by subtracting James' hours from Harry's hours: 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

Therefore, the difference in hours slept between Harry and James is 3 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of tomatoes used by Freda, we must first calculate the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Next, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes were used. Since each can is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, the correct answer is 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we must first consider the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. We are informed that 5 cars took an exit, leaving 25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

We are also given that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes can be calculated by subtracting the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

The calculation is as follows:
Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = 25
Cars that drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes = 20
Cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes = Total cars that drove through the traffic jam - Cars that drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes
= 25 - 20
= 5

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we must first calculate the total number of potted plants she possesses. 

Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home, resulting in a total of 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

Subsequently, she received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, bringing her total to 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

However, Mary has decided to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family. This means she will be giving away a total of 40 potted plants.

To calculate the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

Therefore, Mary will have 58 potted plants remaining.

The final answer is: 58"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we must first calculate the individual contributions of each friend.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we calculate 1/4 of 20, which is 5, and then add it to the first friend's total: 20 + 5 = 25.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, we can calculate the third friend's total by adding 10 to the fourth friend's total: 60 + 10 = 70.

Now, we add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175.

Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings is 175.

"To determine the total inner volume of the three boxes, we must first calculate the inner dimensions of each box. The walls of the boxes are 1 inch thick, so we must subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions.

The length of each box is 5 inches, so the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches.

The width of each box is 6 inches, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of each box is 4 inches, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are three boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

Therefore, the total inner volume of the three boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"To determine the amount of water the boat took on, we must first establish the rate at which the boat is taking on water. It is given that the boat takes on two liters of water for every ten feet it is rowed. 

Given that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the rate at which she rows as 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second. 

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds. To do this, we divide the total time by the rate: 64 seconds / 1.25 feet/second = 51.2 feet. 

Since we are only interested in sets of 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10: 51.2 feet / 10 = 5.12 sets. 

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2: 5.12 sets * 2 liters/set = 10.24 liters.

Therefore, the boat took on 10.24 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

"To determine the profit made by Sasha from selling her leftover lumber, we must first calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue generated from its sale.

Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each, resulting in a total cost of 10 * $10 = $100. Additionally, she has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each, resulting in a total cost of 5 * $16 = $80. The total cost of the lumber is therefore $100 + $80 = $180.

The prices of lumber have increased by 50% since Sasha purchased the lumber. Consequently, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each, and the new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Selling the 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards at the new price of $15 each yields a total revenue of 10 * $15 = $150. Selling the 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the new price of $24 each yields a total revenue of 5 * $24 = $120. The total revenue from the sale of the lumber is therefore $150 + $120 = $270.

To calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, the profit made by Sasha from selling her leftover lumber is $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we must first establish the ratio of sugar to the total mixture. The given ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which implies a total of 20 parts in the mixture (7 parts sugar + 13 parts water).

Given that the total mixture consists of 120 units, we can calculate the number of units per part by dividing the total by the total number of parts: 120 / 20 = 6.

Since sugar constitutes 7 parts of the mixture, we can find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar by multiplying the number of units per part by the number of parts of sugar: 6 * 7 = 42.

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42.

"To determine the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we must first establish the initial salary disparity between the two individuals. Given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can infer that Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's.

Assuming Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, we can calculate Lylah's initial salary as 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Four years later, both Adrien and Lylah experienced a 40% increase in their salaries. To calculate Adrien's new salary, we must first determine 40% of his initial salary, which is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. Adding this to his initial salary, we find that Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Similarly, we calculate Lylah's new salary by determining 40% of her initial salary, which is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. Adding this to her initial salary, we find that Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

"To determine the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we must first calculate the weekly usage and then extrapolate that to a monthly figure.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week, and each pad contains 30 sheets of paper. Therefore, his weekly usage is 2 pads * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the monthly usage by multiplying the weekly usage by 4: 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month.

Therefore, the correct answer is 240 sheets."
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a simple arithmetic problem involving the quantities of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael. To determine the total number of fruits, we must first calculate the individual quantities brought by each party.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael, on the other hand, brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which equates to 2 * 5 = 10 apples. Furthermore, Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, resulting in 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

To find the total number of fruits Morisette brought, we add the quantities of apples and oranges: 5 + 8 = 13. Similarly, to find the total number of fruits Kael brought, we add the quantities of apples and oranges: 10 + 4 = 14.

Therefore, the total number of fruits they have in total is 13 + 14 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we must first establish the hours she slept each day. 

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours. For the subsequent two days, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, which equates to 6 hours each day. 

For the remainder of the week, she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, resulting in 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

To find the total hours, we add the hours slept each day: 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48

Therefore, the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week is 48.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we must consider her speed and the time she spends running at each speed.

First, we calculate the distance she covers at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Next, we calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, we calculate the distance she covers at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

To find the total distance, we add the distance covered at 10 miles per hour and the distance covered at 5 miles per hour:
Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we must consider the information provided. Jennie stamps one-third of the letters needing stamps, which amounts to 20 letters. This leaves 60 - 20 = 40 letters in the pile of letters needing stamps.

Given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, it can be inferred that the 20 letters Jennie stamped were added to this pile. Therefore, the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"In the case of Julia v. The Spoon Conundrum, we have a straightforward mathematical problem that requires a logical analysis of the facts presented.

The facts are as follows: Julia initially purchased a package of spoons, her husband subsequently added 5 more spoons to the collection, and Julia then used 3 spoons for sampling her stew. Ultimately, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

To determine the number of spoons in the initial package purchased by Julia, we must consider the sequence of events and the resulting total number of spoons. 

Let's denote the number of spoons in the initial package as 'x'. After Julia's husband added 5 spoons, the total number of spoons became x + 5. Following the use of 3 spoons, the total number of spoons remaining was x + 5 - 3 = x + 2.

Given that the final total number of spoons is 12, we can set up the equation x + 2 = 12.

Solving for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation, yielding x = 10.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan purchased, we must first establish the quantities of each type of sausage. 

Dylan acquired 38 chicken sausages. Additionally, he purchased 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. Therefore, the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

To calculate the total number of sausages, we must add the quantities of chicken and fish sausages together: 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82.

The total number of sausages purchased by Dylan is 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a straightforward arithmetic problem involving the number of friends two individuals, Lily and Amy, have. 

To determine the total number of friends they have together, we must first establish the number of friends each individual has. It is given that Lily has 50 friends. 

Since Amy has 20 more friends than Lily, we can calculate Amy's total by adding 20 to Lily's total: 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, to find the combined total of friends Lily and Amy have, we add their individual totals: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

Therefore, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the total amount of money Dillon will spend at the store, we must first establish the cost of each item. 

1. The cost of each pepper is $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times the cost of a pepper, which is 3 * $15 = $45.
3. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.
4. Dillon purchases 4 watermelons, resulting in a total cost of 4 * $45 = $180.
5. Dillon purchases 20 peppers, resulting in a total cost of 20 * $15 = $300.
6. Dillon purchases 10 oranges, resulting in a total cost of 10 * $40 = $400.
7. The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To determine the profit made by the hospital from these visits, we must first calculate the total time spent by doctors. This can be done by multiplying the number of patients by the average time per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

The total revenue for the hospital is the number of patients multiplied by the hourly rate charged to the patients, adjusted for the actual time spent per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour = 2000 * $200/hour = $400000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $400000 - $30000
Profit = $370000

Therefore, the hospital's profit from these visits is $370,000.

The final answer is: $370000"
"To determine the number of elves left, we must first calculate the initial reduction in the workforce. A third of the 60 elves quit after being subjected to unpleasant circumstances. This equates to 60 / 3 = 20 elves. Consequently, the remaining workforce is 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Subsequently, 10 of the remaining elves quit after being kicked by children. This further reduces the workforce to 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total expenditure for the two months in question, we must first establish the individual expenditures for each period. 

The expenditure in May was $500. The expenditure in June was $60 less than the expenditure in May. 

Expenditure in June = Expenditure in May - $60
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60
Expenditure in June = $440

Now, we can calculate the total expenditure by adding the expenditures for both months.

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

Therefore, the total expenditure for the two months is $940."
"To determine the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred at the carnival, we must first calculate the total number of rides each individual took and then multiply that by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, resulting in a total of 4 rides. Fred, on the other hand, rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, totaling 6 rides.

The combined total of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Given that each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

Therefore, the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred at the carnival is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we must first calculate the total miles walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which equates to 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. Subtracting the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from this total will provide us with the miles walked on Wednesday: 
41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

Therefore, the correct answer is 13 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the total amount Tom pays for car washes in a year, we must first calculate the monthly expenditure and then extrapolate it to a yearly figure.

Tom receives 4 car washes per month, with each car wash costing $15. Therefore, the monthly expenditure is 4 * $15 = $60.

To find the yearly expenditure, we multiply the monthly expenditure by 12, the number of months in a year:
$60 * 12 = $720.

Therefore, the total amount Tom pays for car washes in a year is $720."
"To determine the number of video games Bobby has, we must first establish the number of video games Brian possesses after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, resulting in him having 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby's video game collection is comprised of 5 fewer than 3 times the number of video games Brian has. To calculate this, we multiply Brian's remaining video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times Brian's remaining video games is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we must first establish the number of unicorns residing in the Scottish Highlands. Given that one third of the total unicorns, which is 27, are located in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this as follows:

27 unicorns / 3 = 9 unicorns

Next, we must calculate the number of female unicorns within this subset. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this as follows:

2/3 * 9 unicorns = 6 unicorns

Therefore, there are 6 female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we must first calculate the cost of the items, then add the delivery fee, and finally, add the tip.

The cost of the items consists of 2 subs for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each, and 2 cookies for $1.00 each. 

1. Calculate the cost of the items:
   - 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
   - 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
   - 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
   - Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

2. Add the delivery fee (20% of $20.00):
   - 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
   - Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

3. Add the tip ($5.00):
   - Total cost with delivery fee and tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

Therefore, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00.

"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we must first calculate the total number of questions he was able to complete in both tests.

In the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 
Time taken to complete the first test = 75 / 5 = 15 hours. 
However, Mark only had 8 hours, so he completed 8 * 5 = 40 questions in the first test.

In the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
Time taken to complete the second test = 100 / 5 = 20 hours. 
However, Mark only had 6 hours, so he completed 6 * 5 = 30 questions in the second test.

Total questions completed = 40 + 30 = 70

Total questions in both tests = 75 + 100 = 175

Questions left incomplete = 175 - 70 = 105

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the available rentals, we must first identify the number of semi-automatic vehicles. 

Given that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

Therefore, the correct answer is 20%."
"To determine the number of worker bees in the hive, we must first establish the relationship between the different types of bees. 

Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 
We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q. 

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700. 

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Since B = 2Q, we have B = 2(100) = 200.

Since W = 2B, we have W = 2(200) = 400.

Therefore, the number of worker bees in the hive is 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we must first calculate the total hours he would work in a week. 

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. If he were to dedicate this time to working, he would work an additional 2 hours each day. 

There are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

Given that Jordan earns $10 per hour, the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

Therefore, the correct answer is $140."
"To determine the total cost of the items purchased by John, we must first categorize the items into food and non-food items. Food items include milk and eggs, while non-food items include light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

The cost of the food items is calculated as follows: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

The cost of the non-food items is calculated as follows: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
However, a 10% tax is applied to the non-food items. To calculate the tax, we multiply the total cost of non-food items by 0.1:
Tax = 0.1 * (3 + 3 + 4) = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

To find the total cost, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the profit made by Kim from his housekeeping business, we must first calculate the total expenses and income.

Kim has a total of 8 clients, consisting of 3 current clients and 5 potential clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths for cleaning.

The total number of bottles of bleach needed per week is 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles. The cost of bleach per bottle is $2, so the total cost of bleach per week is 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32.

Similarly, the total number of packs of cloths needed per week is 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs. The cost of cloths per pack is $5, so the total cost of cloths per week is 8 packs * $5/pack = $40.

The total expenses per week are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths, which is $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Given that Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we must first calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest. Given that there are 100 pineapples per hectare and John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is 100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is 4000."
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a straightforward mathematical problem involving the accumulation of Lego pieces. To determine the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we must calculate the number of pieces in each set and then sum them together.

The first set contains 500 pieces. The second set has three times the number of pieces as the first set, which equates to 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The third set, on the other hand, has one-fourth the number of pieces as the first set, resulting in 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

To find the total number of pieces, we add the number of pieces in each set together: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

Therefore, the total number of blocks Johnny picks up is 2125."
"To determine the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, we must carefully analyze the sequence of events.

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the initial 6 hours. Subsequently, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.

At this point, the total number of bees that have left the hive is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees. However, 15 of these bees returned, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 45 - 15 = 30 bees.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. This equates to 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees. However, 30 of these bees had not returned yet, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 30 (from the initial 30 bees that left) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. Therefore, 30 bees return.

The final answer is: 30"
"In this scenario, we are dealing with a transaction between Brittany's mom and the museum cashier. The cost of admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom purchases one adult ticket and one child ticket.

To determine the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we must first calculate the total cost of the tickets. The cost of the adult ticket is $12 and the cost of the child ticket is $10.

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can infer that the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change received.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier a total of $30."
"To determine the number of Facebook friends James has, we must first establish the number of friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can calculate Dorothy's friend count by dividing Charlie's friend count by 3.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can calculate James' friend count by multiplying Dorothy's friend count by 4, as James has four times as many friends as Dorothy.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a friendly competition between two individuals, Steve and Tim, to see who can get home from school the fastest. The facts of the case are as follows:

Steve resides 3 miles from the school, which equates to 5280 feet, and is permitted to ride his bicycle at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Conversely, Tim resides 2 miles from the school, which equates to 10560 feet, and is able to ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute.

To determine the outcome of this competition, we must calculate the time it takes for each individual to return home from school.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 5280 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 12 minutes

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Given that Steve takes 12 minutes to return home and Tim takes 40 minutes, it is clear that Steve emerges victorious in this competition.

To determine the duration for which the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we must calculate the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 12
Difference in time = 28 minutes

Therefore, the winner, Steve, will be waiting for 28 minutes at their house before the loser, Tim, finishes the race.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Shawnda made from her bike inflation service, we must first calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, we consider the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has two tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. Therefore, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, we consider the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has three tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. Therefore, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Lastly, we consider the unicycle tire. A unicycle has one tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. Therefore, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, we add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

Therefore, Shawnda made a total of $5.00 from her bike inflation service.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"In the context of a transaction involving the purchase of cookies, we must first determine the total cost of the cookies. To do so, we must calculate the total number of cookies purchased and then multiply that number by the cost per cookie.

Carl purchases ten packs of cookies, with each pack containing six cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

The cost per cookie is $0.10. Thus, the total cost of the cookies is 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

When Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is the difference between the $10 bill and the total cost of the cookies, which is $10 - $6 = $4.

Therefore, the change Carl receives is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the initial number of french fries in the pack, we must carefully analyze the sequence of events and the quantities involved.

First, Dave ate 14 french fries. The seagull then consumed half of this amount, which is 7 french fries. This totals 21 french fries eaten.

Next, three pigeons devoured 3 fries each, resulting in a total of 9 additional french fries eaten. This brings the cumulative total to 30 french fries.

At this point, the raccoon's consumption of 2/3 of the remaining fries is crucial. Let's denote the initial number of fries as x. After the pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries remained. The raccoon then consumed 2/3 of this amount, leaving (1/3)(x - 30) fries.

Following the raccoon's consumption, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. This can be expressed as (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we first add 1 to both sides of the equation, resulting in (1/3)(x - 30) = 6. Multiplying both sides by 3 yields x - 30 = 18. Finally, adding 30 to both sides gives us x = 48.

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 48.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we must first calculate the total hours per week. 

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. This equates to 3 hours per day for these days. Since there are three days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day. This equates to 4 hours per day for these days. Since there are two days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. Therefore, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we must first calculate the length of each type of baked good in inches. 

Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches: 2 feet * 12 inches/foot = 24 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Next, we add the total length of each type of baked good together: 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12: 3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet.

Therefore, the total length of the baked goods is 280 feet.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of bananas required for the apes at the zoo for a 2-month period, we must first calculate the monthly consumption of each species and then multiply that by 2.

The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, while the gorillas need 400 bananas per month. The baboons, on the other hand, require 100 bananas per month.

To find the total monthly consumption, we add the bananas required by each species: 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper needs to cover a 2-month period, we multiply the monthly consumption by 2: 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper must order 1400 bananas to meet the needs of the apes for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest between Blake and Kelly, we must calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake's distance can be calculated by multiplying the number of times he ran back and forth by twice the length of the football field. Since he ran 15 times, the total distance is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly's distance can be broken down into two parts: her initial run back and forth, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards, and her subsequent runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She performed this latter action 34 times, resulting in a total distance of 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Therefore, the difference in distance is 80 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total amount Raphael spent on school supplies, we must calculate the individual costs and then sum them.

The cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.
The cost of the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, we add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Therefore, the total amount Raphael spent on school supplies is $34."
"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond, we must analyze the sequence of events. Initially, Finn observes 11 tadpoles. Subsequently, 6 tadpoles emerge from under a lily pad, increasing the total number of tadpoles he can see to 11 + 6 = 17. However, 2 of these tadpoles then hide under a rock, rendering them invisible to Finn. To calculate the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we must subtract the 2 that hid: 17 - 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we must first establish the depth of the water on Tuesday. 

The initial depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had an additional 7 feet of water. Therefore, the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

To calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday, we must find two thirds of the depth on Tuesday. This can be achieved by multiplying 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we must first calculate the number of fish each individual caught.

Anakin's catch consists of 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. The total number of fish caught by Anakin is the sum of these three quantities.

Anakin's total = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Additionally, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Locsin's total = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

To find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin, we add their individual totals.

Total fish caught = Anakin's total + Locsin's total
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we must consider the incremental price increases every two months. The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20, and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

To calculate the price after 36 months, we will apply the 20% increase every two months, which is equivalent to 18 increments.

1. After 2 months: $20 + ($20 * 0.20) = $20 + $4 = $24
2. After 4 months: $24 + ($24 * 0.20) = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
3. After 6 months: $28.80 + ($28.80 * 0.20) = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
4. After 8 months: $34.56 + ($34.56 * 0.20) = $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472
5. After 10 months: $41.472 + ($41.472 * 0.20) = $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664
6. After 12 months: $49.7664 + ($49.7664 * 0.20) = $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968

8. After 16 months: $71.663416 + ($71.663416 * 0.20) = $71.663416 + $14.3326832 = $85.9960992
9. After 18 months: $85.9960992 + ($85.9960992 * 0.20) = $85.9960992 + $17.19921984 = $103.19531904
10. After 20 months: $103.19531904 + ($103.19531904 * 0.20) = $103.19531904 + $20.639063608 = $123.834382648
11. After 22 months: $123.834382648 + ($123.834382648 * 0.20) = $123.834382648 + $24.7668765296 = $148.6012591776
12. After 24 months: $148.6012591776 + ($148.6012591776 * 0.20) = $148.6012591776 + $29.72025183552 = $178.32151101312
13. After 26 months: $178.32151101312 + ($178.32151101312 * 0.20) = $178.32151101312 + $35.664302202624 = $214.985813215744
14. After 28 months: $214.985813215744 + ($214.985813215744 * 0.20) = $214.985813215744 + $42.9971624431488 = $257.9829756588928
15. After 30 months: $257.9829756588928 + ($257.9829756588928 * 0.20) = $257.9829756588928 + $51.59659513177856 = $309.5795707906712
16. After 32 months: $309.5795707906712 + ($309.5795707906712 * 0.20) = $309.5795707906712 + $61.91581415813424 = $371.49538494880544
17. After 34 months: $371.49538494880544 + ($371.49538494880544 * 0.20) = $371.49538494880544 + $74.299076989761088 = $445.794461938566528

"When considering whether to do her taxes herself or hire an accountant, Jackie must weigh the potential financial implications of each option. If she decides to handle her taxes personally, she will forfeit the opportunity to complete 3 hours of freelance work, resulting in a loss of $35 per hour. Conversely, hiring an accountant will incur a direct expense of $90.

To determine the financial advantage of hiring the accountant, we must calculate the difference between the income she would have earned by completing the freelance work and the cost of hiring the accountant. This can be calculated as follows:

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, we compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant:
Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

The difference between the income lost and the cost of hiring the accountant will reveal the financial benefit of choosing the latter option.

Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we must first calculate the total cost of the computer accessories she has purchased.

The computer costs €1090, the scanner costs €157, the CD burner costs €74, and the printer costs €102. 

The total cost of the computer accessories is the sum of these individual costs: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323.

Now, we must subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget of €1500 to find the amount of money she will have left for her clothing.

€1500 - €1323 = €177

Therefore, Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing."
"To determine the number of times Sandra must babysit to obtain the necessary eggs for her school fundraiser, we must first calculate the total number of eggs required. Since each Spanish flan necessitates 3 eggs and Sandra is tasked with making 15, the total number of eggs needed is 3 * 15 = 45.

Next, we must divide the total number of eggs required by the number of eggs Sandra receives per babysitting job, which is 9. Therefore, the calculation is 45 / 9 = 5.

In this scenario, Sandra must babysit 5 times to obtain the necessary eggs for her school fundraiser.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine Seth's age, we must first establish the relationship between Seth and Brooke's ages. It is given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. This can be expressed as an equation: S = 2B, where S represents Seth's age and B represents Brooke's age.

Furthermore, we are informed that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be represented as (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28. Simplifying this equation, we have 3B + 4 = 28.

To solve for B, we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation, yielding 3B = 24. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that B = 8.

Now that we have determined Brooke's age, we can calculate Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B. This gives us S = 2(8), which simplifies to S = 16.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"In the context of this financial scenario, we are presented with a straightforward mathematical problem. To determine the amount of money Jimmy possesses, we must first calculate the amount that is twice the money Ethel has. Given that Ethel has $8, we can calculate this by multiplying 8 by 2, which yields 16.

Next, we are informed that Jimmy has $2 more than this calculated amount. Therefore, we must add 2 to 16 to arrive at the total amount of money Jimmy possesses. This calculation results in 16 + 2 = 18.

Therefore, the correct answer is: $18"
"To determine the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we must consider his daily walking habits. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which encompasses five days. On the weekends, he reduces his daily mileage to 10 miles, covering both Saturday and Sunday.

First, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Friday: 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.

Next, we calculate the total miles walked on the weekends: 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles from the weekdays and the weekends: 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

Therefore, the total miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we must first establish the individual costs of its components. The hat costs $25. 

The jacket, being three times as expensive as the hat, is $25 * 3 = $75.

The pants, being the average of the hat and jacket, are calculated by adding the costs of the hat and jacket and dividing by 2. This results in ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

To find the total cost of each uniform, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150.

The final answer is: $150"

First, we calculate the number of legs for the spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs.

Next, we calculate the number of legs for the insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs.

Lastly, we calculate the number of legs for the mutant invertebrates: 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs.

Now, we sum the number of legs for each group: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210.

The final answer is: 1210"
"To determine the total age of the four birds, we must first establish the ages of each individual bird. 

We are informed that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red's age is two times that of Sally Four, which equates to 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, placing her at 16 + 3 = 19 years.

To calculate the total age of the four birds, we add their individual ages together: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is 51.

The final answer is: 51"
"To determine the total annual payment for Jessica's debts, we must first calculate the increased minimum payment for each debt. 

The increased minimum payment for her student loans is $300 * 1.5 = $450. 
The increased minimum payment for her credit card is $200 * 1.5 = $300. 
The increased minimum payment for her mortgage is $500 * 1.5 = $750.

Now, we add up the increased minimum payments: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500.

To find the total annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

Therefore, the total annual payment for Jessica's debts is $18,000.

"To determine the total time it takes Billy to prepare the potatoes, we must first calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato, then multiply those times by the total number of potatoes.

The time to peel one potato is 1.5 minutes. The time to cut one potato is 5 seconds, which is equivalent to 5/60 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time to peel all 60 potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time to cut all 60 potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes.

To find the total time to prepare all the potatoes, we add the time to peel and the time to cut: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is 95 minutes.

The final answer is: 95"
"To determine the amount spent on lemons, we must first establish the total revenue generated from the sale of lemonade. Given that each glass is sold for $0.50 and 20 glasses are produced per gallon, the total revenue per gallon is $10.

The profit made is $25, and since profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can express the total revenue as the sum of the profit and the total cost. Therefore, the total revenue is $25 + Cost.

Since the revenue per gallon is $10, the number of gallons sold can be calculated as follows:

Number of gallons = Total revenue / $10

However, we cannot directly calculate the number of gallons without knowing the total cost. To find the total cost, we need to consider the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5, with $2 being the cost of sugar. Therefore, the cost of lemons per gallon is $3.

To find the total cost of lemons, we need to determine the total number of gallons sold. Since we know the revenue per gallon and the profit, we can set up an equation to find the total cost:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$10 * Number of gallons - $5 * Number of gallons = $25

Simplifying the equation:

(10 - 5) * Number of gallons = $25
5 * Number of gallons = $25
Number of gallons = $25 / 5
Number of gallons = 5

Now that we have the number of gallons, we can find the total cost of lemons:

Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 * 5
Total cost of lemons = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we must first establish the total number of Chinese participants. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants.

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Next, we need to isolate the number of girls on the Chinese team. Since we know the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, we can calculate the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the amount of money Zaid has left after his expenses and donations, we must follow a step-by-step analysis of his financial transactions.

First, we calculate the amount spent on rent, which is 1/4 of his monthly salary. Given that Zaid earns $6000 per month, the amount spent on rent is $600 (1/4 of $6000).

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel, which is 1/3 of his monthly salary. This amounts to $2000 (1/3 of $6000).

The remaining amount after rent and car fuel expenses is $3400 ($6000 - $600 - $2000).

Zaid then donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is $1700 (1/2 of $3400).

After the donation, the remaining amount is $1700 ($3400 - $1700).

Furthermore, Zaid gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700 for their respective expenses, totaling $900.

Finally, to determine the amount of money Zaid has left, we subtract the total amount given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount: $1700 - $900 = $800.

Therefore, the correct answer is $800."
"To determine the total number of crabs the three individuals possess, we must first establish the number of crabs each person has.

Bo is stated to have 40 crabs. Monic's crab count is 4 fewer than Bo's, which equates to 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. Rani's crab count is 10 more than Monic's, resulting in 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To calculate the total number of crabs, we add the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

The final answer is: 122"
"To determine Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we must calculate his earnings for each week and then sum those amounts.

For the first week, Lloyd's earnings can be calculated by multiplying the number of hours tutored (5 hours) by his hourly wage ($10). This yields a total of $50 for the first week.

Similarly, for the second week, Lloyd's earnings can be calculated by multiplying the number of hours tutored (8 hours) by his hourly wage ($10). This results in a total of $80 for the second week.

To find the total earnings for the first two weeks, we add the earnings from the first week ($50) to the earnings from the second week ($80), which gives us a total of $130.

Therefore, Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks are $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"In a democratic election, the outcome is determined by the number of votes received by each candidate. Given that the total number of students who voted in the class was 80, and the winner secured 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received.

To find the number of votes the winner received, we multiply the total number of votes by the fraction representing the winner's share: 3/4 * 80 = 60 votes.

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received can be calculated by subtracting the winner's votes from the total: 80 - 60 = 20.

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the number of red roses that Fred must deliver to Sandra, we must first establish the relationship between the number of white carnations and the number of red roses. We are informed that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.

We are also told that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This information allows us to establish an equation to find the number of white carnations. If the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, then the number of white carnations (x) multiplied by 5 equals 200.

x * 5 = 200

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses (y) is four times the number of white carnations:

y = 4 * x
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

Therefore, to keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine Jean's age, we must first establish the relationship between Jean, Mark, and Jan. The information provided indicates that Jean is two years older than Mark. 

We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is currently 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 28. 

Using this information, we can calculate Mark's age two years ago as follows: (1/2) * 28 + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19. 

To find Mark's current age, we add 2 to this result, yielding 21. 

Given that Jean is two years older than Mark, we can determine Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age, resulting in 23.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 23"
"In the context of a 4x400 meter relay, where two teams are competing, we have a situation where one team, Team A, has a uniform performance with each member completing their 400-meter leg in 55 seconds. On the other hand, Team B has a less uniform performance, with their first runner completing the leg in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner being 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

To determine the time difference between the two teams, we must calculate the total time for each team. Team A's total time is 4 * 55 seconds, which equals 220 seconds.

For Team B, the first runner completes the leg in 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they complete the leg in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they complete the leg in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they complete the leg in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for Team B is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

Therefore, the faster team will win by 58 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{58}$"
"To determine the likelihood of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, we must first establish the probability of this event. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) and 6 total outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%.

Next, we must calculate the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Since the two events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability between these two events, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% - 25% = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a simple arithmetic problem involving the division of apples picked by Jenna and her mother. The information provided indicates that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples. 

To determine the number of apples Jenna picked, we must calculate half of the number of apples her mother picked. This can be achieved by dividing the number of apples her mother picked by 2. 

20 / 2 = 10

Therefore, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we must add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked.

10 + 20 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we must first establish the total number of straw pieces allocated to the hamsters and rabbits. The hamsters, being kept in 10 cages, each receive 5 pieces of straw, resulting in a total of 10 * 5 = 50 straw pieces.

The rabbits, on the other hand, are allocated 20 pieces of straw.

Combining these totals, we find that the hamsters and rabbits collectively receive 50 + 20 = 70 straw pieces.

Given that a total of 160 straw pieces have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are allocated to the hamsters and rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are allocated to the rats. Therefore, the number of straw pieces allocated to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are divided into 3 cages, with each cage containing an equal number of rats. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Consequently, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

Since each rat is allocated 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats can be calculated as 90 / 6 = 15.

Given that the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can establish the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we find that r = 5.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"In the context of a debt obligation, interest is calculated on the principal amount and any accrued interest. In this scenario, Mandy owes Benedict $100 with a monthly interest rate of 2%.

To determine the total amount Mandy should pay, we must calculate the interest for each month and add it to the principal.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $100 + $2 = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $102 + $2.04 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Therefore, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we must first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of purchasing the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total cost incurred by the three friends, we must first calculate the expenses for the tickets, food, and rides.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25. 
The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, so it's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost is $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since the friends agreed to split the cost evenly, we divide the total cost by 3 to determine each friend's share: $102 / 3 = $34.

Therefore, each friend paid $34.

The final answer is $34."
"To determine the total number of peaches collected by John, we must first establish the rate at which he collects peaches and the duration of his collection.

John collects 2 peaches per minute. 
He collects peaches for 3 hours. 
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he collects for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of peaches per minute by the total minutes: 
2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

Therefore, the total number of peaches collected by John is 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we must first establish the total weekly insect requirement. Each duck necessitates 3.5 pounds of insects per week. 

The total weekly insect requirement for ten ducks is calculated as follows: 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds.

To find the daily insect requirement, we divide the total weekly requirement by the number of days in a week, which is 7. 

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks requires 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left, we must first calculate the net change in the number of trees over the 10-year period. Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, resulting in a net increase of 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net increase is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. Therefore, Tom has a total of 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net increase) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

Subtracting the trees that die from the total, we get 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Therefore, the correct answer is 91."
"To determine the number of pink and white plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard at noon on Sunday, we must analyze the events that transpired.

Initially, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard. On Saturday, they removed one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. These 6 flamingos were then painted white and returned to the yard. This leaves 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. Therefore, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"In the context of a purchase, the concept of change is defined as the difference between the amount of money tendered and the total cost of the goods or services acquired. In this scenario, Violetta has $20 and intends to buy crayons that cost $2 each.

To determine the number of crayons Violetta can purchase, we divide the total amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon.

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

However, since Violetta requires 5 different colors, she can only purchase 2 crayons of each color. This is because she cannot purchase a fraction of a color.

Now, to calculate the change, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money Violetta has.

Total cost of crayons = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 * $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

Therefore, Violetta will receive no change after purchasing the crayons.

The final answer is: $0"
"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we must first establish the cost of a single pen. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we can calculate this by adding the cost of a pencil and an eraser.

A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. Therefore, the cost of a pen is $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of a single pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"In this scenario, we are dealing with a distribution of carrots to 40 restaurants, with each restaurant receiving 2 pounds of carrots. To determine the amount of carrots that will not be used, we must first calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed.

The calculation for the total pounds of carrots distributed is as follows:

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, we must subtract the total pounds distributed from the initial amount to find the pounds not used:

Initial amount = 200 pounds
Total pounds distributed = 80 pounds
Pounds not used = Initial amount - Total pounds distributed = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds

Therefore, the amount of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of children in the city of Soda, we must first identify the total population and the number of adults. The total population is comprised of men, women, and children. 

Given that there are 8417 men and 9092 women, we can calculate the total number of adults by adding these two numbers together.

Total adults = 8417 (men) + 9092 (women)
Total adults = 17509

To find the number of children, we subtract the total number of adults from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Total adults = 17509
Number of children = Total population - Total adults
= 23786 - 17509
= 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine possesses, we must calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them to the initial number.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

Therefore, Elaine now possesses a total of 320 Pokémon cards.

The final answer is: 320"
"To determine the total amount Mark makes in a week, we must first establish the payment structure for his work. It is given that Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.

Given that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the total amount he makes from Publisher A as follows:

500 sentences (half of 1000) * 5 cents per sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice the rate of Publisher A, the payment per sentence for Publisher B is 10 cents.

The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is:

500 sentences * 10 cents per sentence = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes a total of 7500 cents in a week.

The final answer is: 7500"
"In the matter of Baldur's water procurement, we have a straightforward calculation to determine the total amount of water he receives daily. 

Baldur acquires 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. To find the total number of pails, we add these quantities together: 5 pails (morning) + 6 pails (afternoon) = 11 pails.

Each pail contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, the total amount of water Baldur receives daily is calculated by multiplying the total number of pails by the amount of water in each pail: 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To determine the total amount John made that year, we must first calculate his new salary after the 5% raise. The raise is calculated as 5% of his original weekly salary of $2000.

5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100
New salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will have the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year.

Total amount made that year = New salary * Number of weeks
= $2100 * 52
= $109200

Therefore, the total amount John made that year is $109200."
"To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced per year on Josie's 10-acre farm, we must first calculate the total tons of grapes produced annually. Each acre of the farm yields 5 tons of grapes per year. Therefore, the total tons of grapes produced per year is calculated as follows:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we must consider the conversion rate of tons of grapes to barrels of wine. Each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine. Thus, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year on Josie's farm is 100 barrels.

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we must first calculate the slices used for each meal and then add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since he ate a sandwich for 7 days, the total slices used for sandwiches can be calculated as follows:

- Number of days: 7
- Slices per sandwich: 2
- Total slices for sandwiches: 7 * 2 = 14

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Therefore, he used 3 slices per omelet. The total slices used for omelets can be calculated as follows:

- Number of days: 3
- Slices per omelet: 3
- Total slices for omelets: 3 * 3 = 9

Additionally, Carl used 8 slices of cheese in a macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add the slices used for each meal together to determine the total number of slices used:

Total slices = 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet possesses, we must first calculate the total number of blue and red pens she acquired. 

Janet purchased 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens. Therefore, she acquired 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

Similarly, Janet purchased 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens. Consequently, she acquired 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

The total number of new pens she acquired is 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

Janet initially possessed 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, totaling 32 pens.

To find the current total, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she acquired: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

Therefore, the correct answer is 98."
"To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we must first calculate the total score required for the semester. This is done by multiplying the desired average by the total number of tests.

The total number of tests is six, and the desired average is 93. Therefore, the total score required for the semester is 93 * 6 = 558.

Next, we must calculate the total score of the first five tests. This is achieved by adding the scores of the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we must identify the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Now, we can determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test by subtracting the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score required for the semester.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To determine the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we must first calculate the total kilometers for each distinct period of his cycling routine.

For the initial four weeks, Michael rode his bike 5 times a week, covering a distance of 25 kilometers each time. Therefore, the total kilometers for this period can be calculated as follows:

25 kilometers * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 kilometers

Following this, Michael altered his routine to ride his bike 2 times a week, covering a distance of 60 kilometers each time, for a period of 3 weeks. The total kilometers for this period can be calculated as follows:

60 kilometers * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 kilometers

To obtain the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we must add the total kilometers for both periods:

500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

Therefore, the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike is 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: 860"
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we must first establish the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately.

The weight of each chocolate bar is given as 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Next, we must calculate the weight of the candied apples. It is stated that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

With the weight of each candied apple established, we can calculate the total weight of the candied apples by multiplying the weight of one candied apple by the total number of candied apples: 80 * 20g = 1600g.

To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g.

"To determine the total number of cakes Rose purchased, we must first calculate the number of cakes she bought each day.

On Monday, Rose acquired 4 cakes. 
On Tuesday, she purchased three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.
On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

To find the total number of cakes, we add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To determine the cost of each cup, we must first establish the total cost of twenty dozen cups. This can be calculated by subtracting $1200 from the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is sold at $6000 each. 

The total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000. Subtracting $1200 from this amount yields $34,800, which represents the total cost of twenty dozen cups.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups equates to 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"To determine the number of times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

Therefore, the number of times Sara must mow the lawn is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"In the case of Jerry v. Flock of Chickens, we are presented with a scenario where the defendant, Jerry, has a flock of chickens that produce eggs. The red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, while the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day. The total number of eggs collected daily is 42.

Given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can establish a mathematical relationship between the number of red and white chickens. Let R represent the number of red chickens and W represent the number of white chickens. Therefore, W = R + 2.

To determine the number of red chickens, we must calculate the total number of eggs produced by both red and white chickens. This can be represented by the equation 3R + 5W = 42.

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42. Expanding the equation yields 3R + 5R + 10 = 42. Combining like terms, we have 8R + 10 = 42. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 8R = 32. Dividing both sides by 8, we find that R = 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the duration of Gary's walk, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by doubling the sum of its length and width.

Given the length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)
Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can calculate the time Gary spends walking by dividing the total distance by his walking speed of 3 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we must first establish the total number of customers on the first two days. 

On the first day, 100 customers entered the store. On the second day, 50 more customers entered than on the first day, which equates to 150 customers. 

To find the total number of customers on the first two days, we add the number of customers from each day: 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

Now, we know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total customers on the first two days from the total by the third day: 500 - 250 = 250.

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250.

The final answer is: 250"
"To determine the amount of water in the small pool now, we must first establish the initial conditions and the rate at which the water is leaking from both pools.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Consequently, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, which is 2x gallons.

The rate at which the water is leaking from both pools is 4 gallons/minute. Since 4 minutes have passed, the total amount of water leaked from both pools is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 gallons (since 4 gallons leaked out). The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 4 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of hours Lori must work to purchase the desired items, we must first calculate the total amount she needs to earn. This is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total amount she needs to earn is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Next, we divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she must work. Lori's hourly wage is $8.00. 

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44

Therefore, Lori must work 44 hours to earn enough money to purchase the shoes and the belt.

The final answer is: 44"
"In the context of a loan agreement, Janeth's obligation to repay the principal amount of $2000, along with an additional 10% as interest, is a clear stipulation. The monthly payment of $165 for 12 months is a fixed term of repayment.

To determine the remaining balance, we must first calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over the 12-month period. This can be calculated as follows:

$165/month * 12 months = $1980

However, this amount does not account for the additional 10% interest. To calculate the total amount Janeth is obligated to repay, we must add the interest to the principal:

$2000 (principal) + $200 (10% of $2000) = $2200

Now, we can calculate the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount owed:

$2200 (total amount owed) - $1980 (total amount paid) = $220

Therefore, the remaining balance after 12 months is $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we must first establish the number of dahlias present. The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Given that there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

4 (number of roses) + 7 (additional dahlias) = 11 dahlias

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and dahlias together:

4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we must first establish their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, we can infer the ages of the other two individuals based on the provided relationships. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Furthermore, Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

Therefore, the average age of the three in three years is 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the points scored by Jojo, we must first calculate the points scored by the other three students. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. 

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the total time spent by Carmen on these puzzles, we must first calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then sum those values.

The time spent on crossword puzzles is calculated by multiplying the number of crossword puzzles completed by the time it takes to complete one puzzle: 3 crossword puzzles * 10 minutes/puzzle = 30 minutes.

Similarly, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is calculated by multiplying the number of sudoku puzzles completed by the time it takes to complete one puzzle: 8 sudoku puzzles * 5 minutes/puzzle = 40 minutes.

"To determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we must first calculate the total number of cards James has after the specified transactions.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. He loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 grass type cards.

The number of water type cards after losing 8 is 40 - 8 = 32.
The total number of cards after losing 8 water type cards is 90 - 8 = 82.

After buying 14 grass type cards, the total number of cards becomes 82 + 14 = 96.
The number of grass type cards becomes 20 + 14 = 34.

Now, we can calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
= (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.333...%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33}$"
"To determine the amount Chad still owes, we must calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. Chad also selects extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and two sauces for $0.25 each, totaling $0.50. The total cost of these additional items is $4.50.

Adding the cost of the base burrito and the additional items, we get $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00. Chad then upgrades his meal for an additional $3.00, bringing the total to $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

However, Chad has a gift card for $5.00, which he applies to his purchase. To find the remaining amount owed, we subtract the gift card value from the total cost: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"In the context of this problem, we are dealing with a collaborative effort between Kalinda and her mother to complete a 360-piece puzzle. The rate at which they can complete the puzzle is a critical factor in determining the time required for its completion.

Kalinda's rate of puzzle completion is 4 pieces per minute. Her mother's rate is half of Kalinda's, which is 2 pieces per minute. To find their combined rate, we add their individual rates together.

Combined rate = Kalinda's rate + Mother's rate
Combined rate = 4 pieces/minute + 2 pieces/minute
Combined rate = 6 pieces/minute

Now, to determine the time required to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate.

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute
Time = 60 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

Time (in hours) = 60 minutes / 60
Time (in hours) = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mother 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To determine the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we must analyze the given information step by step.

First, we establish that 30% of the initial 120 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. This equates to 0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons.

Subsequently, we calculate the remaining watermelons after two months by subtracting the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the initial total: 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Next, we calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks, which is 3/4 of the remaining watermelons: 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons.

Finally, to determine the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the remaining watermelons: 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

Therefore, the correct answer is 21."
"To determine the total cost of the fleet of cars, we must consider the initial purchase price, the tax on the vehicles, and the registration fees.

First, we calculate the total cost of the cars: 12 vehicles at $20,000 each amounts to $240,000.

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. A 10% tax on $240,000 is equivalent to 0.1 * $240,000, which equals $24,000.

Additionally, we must account for the registration fees. With 12 cars at $1000 each, the total registration fee is $12,000.

To find the total cost, we add the initial purchase price, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total cost for Mark is $276,000.

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs to grow his cherry tomatoes, we must first calculate the total number of tomatoes he and his girlfriend consume per week. 

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats half that amount, which is 3 tomatoes per day. To find the total number of tomatoes they eat per week, we multiply their daily consumption by 7.

Steve's weekly consumption: 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week
Girlfriend's weekly consumption: 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The combined weekly consumption is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find the number of vines needed: 
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet their weekly tomato consumption.

The final answer is: 21"

"To determine the number of students who exited through exit C, we must analyze the given sequence of events.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall.

First, 30% of the students exited through exit A:
30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students exited through exit A.
The remaining students are 1000 - 300 = 700.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students exited through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students exited through exit B.
The remaining students are 700 - 420 = 280.

Therefore, the number of students who exited through exit C is 280.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"In this scenario, we have a straightforward mathematical problem involving the distribution of candies among three individuals: James, Robert, and John. 

Given that John has 54 candies, we can deduce the number of candies Robert and James possess. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, Robert must have half the number of candies John has, which is 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Furthermore, it is stated that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To determine the difference in the number of candies between John and James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54 - 33 = 21.

"To determine the total time Mike spends writing a week, we must first calculate the total number of pages he writes. Mike receives 2 letters a week from each of his 3 remaining pen pals, resulting in a total of 2 * 3 = 6 letters. Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

As Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages he writes is 30 + 30 = 60 pages.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

"To determine the number of fish in each aquarium, we must first establish the relationship between the number of snails and the number of fish. The problem states that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the makeup services provided to Jean, we must first calculate the total cost of the services rendered. 

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and requires 6 hours per day to complete the makeup. Therefore, the daily cost is $250 * 6 = $1500. 

Since the makeup artist requires the services 4 times a week, the weekly cost is $1500 * 4 = $6000. 

The movie production takes 5 weeks to complete, so the total cost for the makeup services is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

However, after the completion of the movie, the makeup artist offers a 10% discount to Jean. The discount amount is 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000.

Therefore, the total amount Jean paid for the makeup services is $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"

Total weight = 200 pounds

Next, we must calculate the total cost of the onions. The cost per pound of onions is $1.50. 
Total cost = Total weight * Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

Therefore, the total amount spent by the chef on onions is $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister, we must first establish the number of cookies each consumed. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Given that her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, Sue's consumption for that day was 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's consumption was twice that of her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, Sue's consumption for that day was 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

To calculate the total calories consumed by each, we must first determine the total number of cookies eaten by each. Sue's total is 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies. Her sister's total is 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Given that each cookie contains 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories consumed by each. Sue's total calories are 46 * 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister's total calories are 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we must first establish the total number of girls in the school. Given that the school is comprised of 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We are informed that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Given that the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 33 = -3.

"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we must first calculate the total number of cows added to each stall by Mr. Sylas. 

Mr. Sylas purchased 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

Number of cows added to each stall = Total cows bought / Number of stalls
= 40 / 10
= 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 * 8
= 192

Therefore, the correct answer is 192."

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree, we must first calculate the total weight of the tree. Given that each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we need to find the total number of 10-foot sections in the tree.

The redwood tree is 200 feet tall. To find the total number of sections, we divide the height of the tree by the length of each section: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, since termites have eaten 30% of the wood, we must calculate the weight of the wood that has been consumed. To do this, we find 30% of 8000: 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds.

To find the final weight of the tree, we subtract the weight of the consumed wood from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

Therefore, the final weight of the redwood tree is 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"In the context of a library's fine policy, it is essential to calculate the total amount owed by an individual, in this case, Nancy, for returning overdue books. 

To determine the total amount owed, we must first calculate the fine for the overdue books. Since Nancy owes $0.50 cents each on 8 books, the total fine for the books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.

Additionally, a flat fee of $2.00 is imposed for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. Therefore, the total amount owed by Nancy is the sum of the fine for the books and the flat fee, which is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

"To determine the total number of fruits, we must first establish the quantities of each fruit possessed by both Andrea and Jamal.

From the information provided, we know that Andrea has 52 apples. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can deduce that Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Furthermore, it is stated that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Therefore, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Additionally, we are informed that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. Consequently, Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

To calculate the total number of fruits, we must add the quantities of apples and bananas possessed by both Andrea and Jamal: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168.

Therefore, the total number of fruits is 168.

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs to bake the cookies, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she is making. Carla is baking 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are required to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. To do this, we divide the total number of cookies by 12: 66 / 12 = 5.5.

Now, we need to convert 5.5 dozen cookies into cups of flour. Since 5.5 dozen is equivalent to 5 dozen and 6 cookies, we need to calculate the flour needed for 6 cookies. Six cookies is half of a dozen, so we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Next, we need to calculate the flour required for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. Five dozen cookies need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

Therefore, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

The final answer is: 11"
"To determine the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we must first calculate two thirds of the total number of pennies. 

The total number of pennies is 9,300. Two thirds of this amount can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300.

Performing the calculation, we find that two thirds of 9,300 is 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.

Therefore, the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

**Answer:** $62"
"In the matter of Maddison's marble collection, we have a straightforward calculation to determine the total number of marbles she possesses.

Maddison initially has 5 boxes, each containing 50 marbles. To find the total number of marbles, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box: 5 * 50 = 250 marbles.

Subsequently, Maddison receives 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she now possesses, we add the initial number of marbles to the marbles received: 250 + 20 = 270 marbles.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: 270"
"To determine the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we must first establish the number of trees in each yard.

Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand's yard contains half the number of trees that Chris has, which is 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Next, we calculate the number of trees in Harry's yard. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

Therefore, Harry has 11 trees.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the combined total of the funds possessed by Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy, we must first establish the individual amounts each possesses.

Carmen's funds are $100. 
Samantha's funds are $25 more than Carmen's, which equates to $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy's funds are $50 more than Samantha's, which equates to $125 + $50 = $175.

To calculate the combined total, we add the individual amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

Therefore, the total amount of funds possessed by Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy is $400."
"To determine the total price of the house, we must consider the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. 

The selling price of the property is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price, is calculated as 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price, is calculated as 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find the difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000, we subtract the budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

Therefore, the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget by $4,500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we must first calculate the total amount he paid in fees and then subtract it from the selling price, followed by subtracting the remaining loan amount.

The transfer fees amount to 3% of the selling price, which is 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000. Additionally, the brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which equals 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000. The total fees paid by Mr. Tan are $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Subtracting the total fees from the selling price, we get $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000. This represents the net selling price after deducting the fees.

However, Mr. Tan still has a remaining loan amount of $250,000 that he needs to pay. Therefore, his net proceeds from selling the house are $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we must first calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. 

The initial heating time is 20 minutes. To find the additional time required to heat the oil to 400 degrees, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

Next, we need to determine the cooking time. It is given that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Therefore, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the heating time and the cooking time: 28 (heating to 400 degrees) + 23 (cooking) = 51 minutes.

However, we must also consider the initial heating time to 300 degrees, which is 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time is 20 (initial heating) + 28 (heating to 400 degrees) + 23 (cooking) = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: 71"
"To determine the total amount spent by the real estate agent on all the ads, we must first calculate the expenditures for each type of advertisement. 

The cost of each newspaper ad is $5, and the agent purchased 50 of these ads. Therefore, the total expenditure for newspaper ads is $5 * 50 = $250.

Similarly, the cost of each television ad is $75, and the agent purchased 15 of these ads. Consequently, the total expenditure for television ads is $75 * 15 = $1125.

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the expenditures for newspaper and television ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

Therefore, the total amount spent by the real estate agent on all the ads is $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"To determine the number of blue golf balls, we must first establish the total number of golf balls, which constitutes half of the total balls the juggler can juggle.

Given that the juggler can juggle 16 balls, we can calculate the number of golf balls as follows:

Total balls = 16
Golf balls = Total balls / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8

Next, we need to calculate the number of blue golf balls, which is half of the golf balls.

Blue golf balls = Golf balls / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4

Therefore, the correct answer is 4."
"In the matter of Mary's M&M acquisition, we have a straightforward calculation to determine the total number of M&Ms she obtained.

The first bag contains 300 M&Ms. The second bag, as per the stipulated conditions, has 12 more M&Ms than the first, thereby totaling 312 M&Ms. The third bag, unfortunately, has a hole in it, resulting in a reduced quantity of M&Ms, specifically half the amount in the first bag, which equates to 150 M&Ms.

To arrive at the total number of M&Ms, we must aggregate the quantities from each bag: 300 + 312 + 150.

The calculation yields: 300 + 312 = 612, and then 612 + 150 = 762.

Therefore, the total number of M&Ms Mary acquired is 762.

The final answer is: 762"
"To determine the total number of windows between the houses, we must first calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom contains 2 windows. Therefore, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of each house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

In addition to the windows in the bedrooms, each house has 4 windows not connected to bedrooms. With 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

To find the total number of windows, we add the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows: 12 + 8 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the change owed to the mother, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased. The cost of the cocoa is $4.20, the laundry is $9.45, and the pasta is $1.35. 

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35
Total cost = $14.00

Next, we must subtract the total cost from the amount the mother paid, which is $20.

Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

Therefore, the change owed to the mother is $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we must first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Given that there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

Therefore, the number of stitches for each sleeve is 315.

**The final answer is: 315**"
"In the context of this transaction, we are dealing with a straightforward calculation of total expenditures. To determine the total amount of money spent on seeds, we must first calculate the individual costs of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets multiplied by $40 per packet, which equals $800. This is a straightforward arithmetic operation.

Similarly, the cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets multiplied by $30 per packet, resulting in a total of $2400.

To find the total cost of the seeds, we add the cost of the tomato seeds to the cost of the celery seeds, yielding a grand total of $800 + $2400 = $3200.

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on seeds is $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we must first calculate the lines for each component of the production.

The solo song contains 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, resulting in 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, which equates to 36 lines.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, totaling 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, which is equivalent to 48 lines.

To find the total number of lines Sean must memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

Therefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is 138.

The final answer is: $\boxed{138}$"
"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we must first calculate the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we must first calculate the time required for small holes and large holes separately.

For small holes, Matthew spends 3 minutes per hole. With 30 small holes to dig, the total time is 3 minutes * 30 = 90 minutes.

For large holes, Matthew spends 10 minutes per hole. With 15 large holes to dig, the total time is 10 minutes * 15 = 150 minutes.

The combined time for both small and large holes is 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, the total time it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is 4 hours."
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we must first establish their current ages. Since we know that the sum of their ages is 20, we can express this as an equation: M + m = 20, where M represents Mico's age and m represents Marco's age.

To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

Substituting M + m = 20 into the equation, we get (20 + 10) + (20 + 10) = 30 + 30 = 60.

Therefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine Sam's current age, we must analyze the given information and apply logical reasoning.

Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

We are given two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

Therefore, Sam's current age is 6 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"In the context of a transaction, the total amount paid by Peter can be calculated by determining the cost of the items purchased and summing those costs.

The cost of the popsicles is calculated by multiplying the number of popsicles by the price per popsicle, which is 20 * $0.25 = $5.

Similarly, the cost of the ice cream bars is calculated by multiplying the number of ice cream bars by the price per ice cream bar, which is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars together, resulting in $5 + $2 = $7.

Therefore, the total amount paid by Peter is $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To determine the total number of spots on the snakes in the park, we must first calculate the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas separately.

The number of cobras is 40, and each cobra has 70 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots on the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, each mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

The number of mambas is 60, so the total number of spots on the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To determine the total amount Maddy will spend on pizzas, we must first calculate the total number of individuals she needs to accommodate. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, totaling 15 individuals. Each team member brings 2 guests, resulting in 12 * 2 = 24 additional guests. Therefore, the total number of people Maddy needs to provide for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas required is 39 / 3 = 13.

Given that each pizza costs $15, the total expenditure will be 13 * 15 = $195.

Therefore, the total amount Maddy will spend on pizzas is $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we must first calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces between the gemstones.

Each topaz gemstone is one inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find the number of beads, we need to find the total length of the space between the gemstones. 

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

Now, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: 1.75 / (1/4) = 1.75 / 0.25 = 7.

Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace is 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"In the context of this family's creative endeavor, we have three individuals contributing to a collective literary effort. Alani, Braylen, and Margot are the primary contributors, each with their own writing output.

Alani's initial contribution consists of 20 stories. Her brother, Braylen, has written 40 stories, while her sister, Margot, has penned 60 stories. These numbers represent their individual outputs for the first week.

To determine the total number of stories written during this initial period, we must aggregate their individual contributions. This is achieved by adding the number of stories each has written.

20 (Alani's stories) + 40 (Braylen's stories) + 60 (Margot's stories) = 120 stories

In the subsequent week, each of these writers doubled their initial output. This means Alani's 20 stories became 40, Braylen's 40 stories became 80, and Margot's 60 stories became 120.

The total number of stories written in the second week is the sum of these doubled outputs: 40 (Alani's doubled stories) + 80 (Braylen's doubled stories) + 120 (Margot's doubled stories) = 240 stories

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we must combine the outputs from both weeks.

Total stories = 120 (first week) + 240 (second week) = 360

Therefore, the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot is 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the future age of Ann's brother, we must first establish his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his current age by multiplying Ann's age by 2.

The brother's current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

To find his age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age.

The brother's age in 3 years will be 18 + 3 = 21 years.

Therefore, the correct answer is 21."
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left after purchasing a can of pop, we must first calculate the total value of her initial funds. 

Kelly possesses 5 quarters, each valued at 25 cents. Multiplying the number of quarters by their respective value yields 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 

In addition to the quarters, Kelly also has 2 dimes, each valued at 10 cents. Multiplying the number of dimes by their respective value yields 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Combining the values of the quarters and dimes, we find that Kelly initially possesses a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Now, we must subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from Kelly's initial total. 

145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Therefore, Kelly has 90 cents remaining after purchasing the can of pop.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of rows of 5-star arrangements on the flag, we must first calculate the total number of stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars.

There are three rows of 8 stars, resulting in a total of 3 * 8 = 24 stars.
There are two rows of 6 stars, resulting in a total of 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

The combined total of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Given that the flag has a total of 76 stars, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row consists of 5 stars, the number of rows of 5-star arrangements is 40 / 5 = 8.

Therefore, the correct answer is 8."
"To determine the number of trucks required to transport 80 flagstones, we must first calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and there are 80 flagstones. Therefore, the total weight is 80 * 75 pounds.

The total weight of the flagstones is 6000 pounds. Next, we need to divide this total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks, which is 2000 pounds per truck.

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

Therefore, the number of trucks required to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane, we must first establish the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, and the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, the car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles/hour.

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles, we can calculate the time taken by the car in the fast lane using the formula: time = distance / speed. However, this information is not necessary to answer the question, as we are only concerned with the car in the slow lane.

To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we can use the same formula: time = distance / speed. Since the distance is the same for both cars (480 miles) and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour, we can calculate its time as follows:
time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the total number of medals given out for counting, we must first establish the relationship between the medals won by Ali and Izzy and the total number of medals given out.

Ali, a skilled counter, has won 22 medals. His friend Izzy, also an accomplished counter, has 5 fewer medals than Ali, which equates to 17 medals.

When combined, Ali and Izzy possess a total of 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together, they have 10 times fewer medals than have been given out for counting. This implies that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy collectively possess.

Let x represent the total number of medals given out. Therefore, 10x = 39.

To calculate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

**The final answer is: $\boxed{3.9}$**"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a distribution of assets (chocolate bars) among a group of individuals (adults and children). The key to resolving this issue lies in understanding the principles of equitable distribution.

First, we must determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we must allocate the chocolate bars to the adults. Each adult is entitled to 6 chocolate bars, resulting in a total of 4 * 6 = 24 chocolate bars allocated to the adults.

The remaining chocolate bars, which are 40 - 24 = 16, are to be distributed among the children. Since there are 8 children, we must divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to determine the equitable share for each child. Therefore, 16 / 8 = 2.

In conclusion, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total earnings of Susan for the online task, we must first calculate the total time she dedicates to the task. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a 3-hour period. However, she takes a half-hour break during this time.

The total working hours can be calculated as follows:

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

To find the total minutes worked, we convert the hours to minutes:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to determine the number of 10-minute intervals within the total minutes worked:

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Now, we can calculate her total earnings by multiplying the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan's total earnings for the online task are $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we must first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 21 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82.

The final answer is: $\boxed{82}$"
"In this scenario, we have a straightforward mathematical problem that requires us to determine the number of unwashed oranges. 

First, we need to establish the age of the youngest son, which is half the age of the oldest son. Given that the oldest son is 8 years old, the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now, we know that each son washes the same number of oranges as their age. Therefore, the oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. 

To find the total number of oranges washed, we add the number of oranges washed by each son: 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will initially bought 15 oranges, we can calculate the number of unwashed oranges by subtracting the total number of oranges washed from the initial amount: 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

Therefore, the correct answer is that there are 3 oranges left unwashed."
"To determine the total count of activities Darren performed in two days, we must first calculate the number of activities for each day.

On the first day, Darren performed 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

The total number of activities on the first day is 100 + 50 + 20 = 170.

On the second day, Darren performed 20 more pushups than on the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He also performed 10 fewer squats, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats. Furthermore, he doubled the number of dumbbell presses, which is 20 * 2 = 40.

The total number of activities on the second day is 120 + 40 + 40 = 200.

Therefore, the total count of activities in two days is 170 + 200 = 370.

The final answer is: 370"
"To determine the duration a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household with 5 members who consume rice every lunch and dinner, we must first calculate the daily consumption of rice.

Each member consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. Therefore, each member's daily consumption is 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Considering there are 5 members in the household, the total daily consumption is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the daily consumption (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the duration in weeks by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the extent to which Sam fell short of his target, we must first calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, which means he did not sell any crates on those days. However, he did sell 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

The total number of crates sold can be calculated as follows:

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

To determine the extent to which Sam fell short of his target, we must compare the total number of crates sold to his target of 120 crates.

Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

Therefore, Sam fell short of his target by 55 crates.

The final answer is: 55"
"To determine the total cost of the desk, we must first establish the sequence of bids. The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid increases by $50. Since there are 3 other bidders, each of whom places one bid, and Carmen places a bid after each of them, the total number of bids is 3 (from the other bidders) + 3 (from Carmen) = 6 bids.

The total cost of the desk can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = $200, d = $50, and n = 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

Therefore, the total cost of the desk is $1950.

The final answer is: $1950"
"To determine the total cost of the driving service for John, we must consider the total miles driven, the driving cost, and the bonus paid to the driver.

First, we calculate the total miles driven. Since John commutes to work and back each day, the daily mileage is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. Multiplying this by the number of days worked per week, we get 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. Extending this to the total number of weeks worked in a year, we find that the total miles driven per year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Next, we calculate the driving cost. The driver charges $2 per mile, so the total driving cost per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

In addition to the driving cost, John also pays a monthly bonus of $150. To find the total bonus paid per year, we multiply this amount by the number of months in a year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Finally, we calculate the total cost by adding the driving cost and the bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

Therefore, the total cost of the driving service for John is $31800 per year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To determine the amount of time Peter must exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes. On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. 

The combined time for both days is calculated as follows: 23 minutes (Sunday) + 16 minutes (Monday) = 39 minutes.

To meet his goal, Peter must exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. Therefore, we multiply the combined time by 2: 39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter must exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to meet his goal."
"In the context of a 32-page tabloid, the arrangement of pages after folding is a crucial factor in determining the number of pieces of paper required. 

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we can consider the following arrangement:

- The first page (page 1) is on the left back.
- The second page (page 2) is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back.
- The 31st page is on the right front.

This pattern continues until we reach the middle of the paper, where the 16th page is on the left back and the 15th page is on the left front. 

After the middle, the pattern reverses, with the 17th page on the right back and the 16th page on right front.

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, we need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages (left and right sides) and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages (left and right sides).

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 (for the first 16 pages) + 2 (for the last 16 pages) = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we must first calculate the total amount she spent at the town fair. 

Annika spent half of her initial $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. 

Additionally, she spent $10 on rides. 

Therefore, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

To find the amount left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we must first establish the number of books sold in that year. 

Given that Elise has been selling her father's collection of 250 books over three years, and there are currently 50 unsold books, we can calculate the total number of books sold as follows:

Total books = 250
Unsold books = 50
Total books sold = Total books - Unsold books
Total books sold = 250 - 50
Total books sold = 200

We are also informed that Elise sold 45 books this year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year:

Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year
Books sold in the first year = 2 * 45
Books sold in the first year = 90

Now, we can calculate the number of books sold in the second year:

Books sold in the second year = Total books sold - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
Books sold in the second year = 200 - 45 - 90
Books sold in the second year = 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:

Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
Total money earned in the second year = 65 * 20
Total money earned in the second year = 1300

Therefore, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is $1300."
"To determine Watson's total earnings for the month of April, we must first calculate his weekly earnings. As Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week, his total hours worked in a week are 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week.

Given that Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week. Additionally, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.

Therefore, his total weekly earnings are $500/week (hourly wage) + $300/week (bonus) = $800/week.

Since April has 4 weeks, Watson's total earnings for the month are $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the number of individuals John lost to in the arm wrestling competition, we must first calculate the percentage of opponents he did not defeat. Since he beat 80% of the participants, the remaining percentage represents those he lost to.

The total number of participants is 20. To find the number of individuals John lost to, we calculate 20% of 20.

20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4

Therefore, John lost to 4 people in the arm wrestling competition.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we must first calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the bakery's daily production of 60 loaves are sold in the morning. 

The calculation for the morning sales is as follows: 
60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Now, we need to calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon. Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 
20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

Therefore, the correct answer is 10 loaves of bread sold in the afternoon."
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to consider the rate at which Joey loses weight. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, which means he loses 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can conclude that Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight that Joey loses in the same amount of time. However, this is not the correct approach.

The correct approach is to determine the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, and Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can conclude that Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to divide the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds by 4, and then multiply the result by 4 is incorrect.

"To determine the total savings, we must first calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

Therefore, the total savings from purchasing 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we must consider the frequency and duration of limb growth.

The serum causes the growth of an extra arm every three days. Over a period of fifteen days, this would result in 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Similarly, the serum causes the growth of an extra leg every five days. Over a period of fifteen days, this would result in 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs together: 5 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs after fifteen days.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the amount Theo has available for purchasing gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we must first calculate the total expenses incurred prior to gift purchases.

1. The cost of the business suits is calculated as 6 suits * $100 = $600.
2. The cost of the suitcases is 3 suitcases * $50 = $150.
3. The cost of the flight ticket is 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this amount, so the total cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.
4. The total expenses incurred prior to gift purchases are $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.
5. Theo's initial budget is $6000. After deducting the total expenses incurred, he has $6000 - $1950 = $4050 remaining.
6. Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount available for gift purchases is $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

However, since Theo wishes to save $2000, he actually has $2050 - $2000 = $50 left over, which he can spend on gifts.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we must first calculate the daily consumption. 

Three family members consume 3 eggs each day, resulting in a total of 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. 

The remaining family members, totaling 5 - 3 = 2, consume 2 eggs each day, resulting in a total of 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

Combining these amounts, the family consumes 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7, yielding 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

Therefore, the family consumes 91 eggs in a week.

The final answer is: 91"
"To determine Trent's age, we must first establish the age of Jane. Given that Quinn is 30 years old and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, Jane's age can be calculated as follows: 30 - 3 = 27.

Now, considering Trent is 5 years older than Jane, we can calculate Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age: 27 + 5 = 32.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the current population of Chile, we must first establish the relationship between the ages of Noah and Cera six years ago. Given that Cera is currently 46 years old, we can infer that six years ago, Cera was 40 years old.

Since Noah was half as old as Cera at that time, we can calculate Noah's age as 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

As the problem also states that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, we can calculate the current population by doubling the population six years ago. This results in a current population of 2 * 60000 = 120000.

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 120000."
"In the context of a football team, the total number of players is comprised of three distinct groups: offense, defense, and special teams. We are given that the total number of players is 105.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. It is stipulated that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, which implies that the number of players on the offense is 2D.

Furthermore, the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, which translates to D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combining like terms yields:

7D = 210

Dividing both sides by 7:

D = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the number of people attending Martha's Christmas party, we must first calculate the total number of individuals invited. 

Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. 
2 * 6 = 12 people from the first group
3 * 4 = 12 people from the second group
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

However, 8 people were unable to attend due to illness. 
24 - 8 = 16 people

Furthermore, 1/4 of the 8 people who were unable to attend due to illness had previous commitments. 
1/4 * 8 = 2 people

Subtracting the individuals who had previous commitments from the total number of people who were initially invited, we get:
16 - 2 = 14 people

Therefore, 14 people will attend Martha's Christmas party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we must first calculate the total number of marbles. Solomon initially acquired 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store containing 50 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles in the store after the purchase from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

Subsequently, Solomon's father provided him with 2/5 times the number of marbles he purchased from Johanna. To calculate this, we multiply 2/5 by 20, which equals (2/5) * 20 = 8. Consequently, Solomon's father gave him 8 additional marbles.

The total number of marbles Solomon now possesses in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2 kilograms. To determine the total weight of the marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

Therefore, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kilograms.

The final answer is: 156"
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we must first calculate the volume of the pool. The pool's dimensions are 6 feet in length, 4 feet in width, and 5 feet in depth.

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length multiplied by width multiplied by height. 

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we must consider the cost per cubic foot to fill the pool, which is $0.1. 

To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

Therefore, the total cost to fill the pool is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we must first establish the number of girls and nongendered children based on the given information.

The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys. Given that there are 30 boys, the number of girls can be calculated as follows:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Furthermore, the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we must add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123.

The final answer is: 123"
"To determine the total number of electric poles required to supply electricity in a neighborhood, we must first understand the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This ratio indicates that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are necessary.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can establish an equation to find the number of electric poles. Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'x'. Consequently, the number of electric wires would be 3 times the number of electric poles, which is 3x.

We can now set up the equation based on the given information:

3x = 45

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the number of women left at the party, we must first establish the total number of people who left. Given that 1/4 of the total number of people departed, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of people by 1/4. 

The initial number of people at the party was 25 men and 15 women, totaling 40 individuals. Therefore, 1/4 of 40 is 10. This means 10 people left the party.

Since 22 men remained, we can infer that 3 men left, as 25 men were initially present. Consequently, the remaining 7 individuals who left were women, as 10 people departed in total.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women. Therefore, 15 women initially were present, and 7 left, leaving 8 women at the party.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the cost of the pen, we must first establish the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book is valued at $4, the magazine's cost is $4 / 2 = $2.

Next, we must calculate the cost of the pen. Given that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine, we can deduce that the pen's cost is $2 - $1 = $1.

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we must first calculate the total number of pencils Jam and Meg possess. Jam has three boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils. Her sister, Meg, has 46 pencils.

We can calculate the number of pencils in each box by subtracting the loose pencils from the total number of pencils Jam has: 26 - 2 = 24. Since Jam has 3 boxes, we divide the total number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes to find the number of pencils per box: 24 / 3 = 8.

Now, we calculate the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together: 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box: 72 / 8 = 9.

Therefore, the correct answer is 9 boxes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we must consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and we are cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. To find the number of ice cubes required, we divide the total temperature difference by the cooling effect of each ice cube: 65 / 13 = 5.

Since each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters, the total weakening caused by the 5 ice cubes is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Next, we consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. This will also weaken the coffee by 15 milliliters.

To find the total weakening of the coffee, we add the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"In the context of a record store where a trade-in policy is in place, it is essential to understand the ratio of old records to new records. The policy stipulates that 2 old records are traded for 1 new record. 

Given that 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records between them, we can calculate the total number of old records traded. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the number of old records traded is twice the number of new records.

Number of new records = 7
Number of old records traded = 2 * Number of new records
Number of old records traded = 2 * 7
Number of old records traded = 14

To determine the total number of old records brought in, we divide the total number of old records traded by the number of people, as each person brought in the same number of old records.

Number of old records per person = Number of old records traded / Number of people
Number of old records per person = 14 / 5
Number of old records per person = 2.8

However, since records cannot be traded in fractional parts, we can infer that the 5 people must have brought in a total of 14 old records, as this is the minimum number required to meet the trade-in ratio and yield 7 new records.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we must first establish the number of junior and senior programmers. The company has 100 employees, and the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees.

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100
= 40

Consequently, the number of senior programmers is:
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Next, we calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers:
Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

The salary of senior programmers is $400 more than that of junior programmers:
Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, we calculate the total amount paid to senior programmers:
Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Finally, we determine the total amount paid to all programmers:
Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"To determine the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we must analyze the given information. 

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

Therefore, the correct answer is 14."
"To determine the current number of lollipops Oscar possesses, we must meticulously analyze the sequence of events.

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops. Upon his departure for school, he consumes 2, thereby reducing his total to 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Subsequently, Oscar distributes 14 lollipops to his friends, resulting in a remaining total of 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

Following this, Oscar acquires twice the number of lollipops he distributed to his friends, which amounts to 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Consequently, his total increases to 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

The next day, Oscar consumes 3 lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Lastly, Oscar consumes 2 additional lollipops, resulting in a final total of 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Therefore, the current number of lollipops Oscar possesses is 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the time it takes to fully charge a cell phone that is currently at 60% charged, we must first calculate the remaining percentage points needed to reach 100% charge. This is calculated as 100% - 60% = 40%.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge the remaining 40% by multiplying 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"In the matter of Erin v. Lollipop Distribution, we have a straightforward case of property transfer and diminution. Erin, the plaintiff, initially possessed 7 lollipops. Her mother, in a benevolent act, gifted her an additional 10 lollipops, thereby increasing Erin's total to 17 lollipops.

However, Erin's possession of lollipops was subsequently diminished when she transferred 3 lollipops to Ella, a third party. To determine the current state of Erin's lollipop holdings, we must calculate the difference between her total lollipops and the number she transferred.

The calculation is as follows: 17 (initial total) - 3 (transferred lollipops) = 14.

Therefore, Erin currently possesses 14 lollipops.

The final answer is: 14"
"To determine the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we must first calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip. The customer spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they receive a $1 reward. Therefore, the rewards earned are $80 / $20 = $4.

On the current shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used their rewards, which amounts to $4 off the price. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find the amount the customer paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent: $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

Therefore, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we must consider the total income, property tax, and income tax for each job.

Job A is located in a state with a 20% total tax rate. The total income for this job is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. Since the property tax is not specified, we will assume it is $0. The income tax for Job A is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. Therefore, the net income for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B is located in a state with a $6,000 property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. The total income for this job is $42,000. The net income before tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The income tax for Job B is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. Therefore, the net income for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we compare the net income of each job. Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B offers a higher net pay.

However, the question asks for the difference in net pay between the two jobs. To find this, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we must first calculate the total number of ruined castles. 40% of the 220 castles are ruined. 

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we must divide the number of ruined castles by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we must calculate the total cost of each proposal. 

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. The total amount paid in installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. Adding the advance payment, the total cost of Furniture United's offer is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. The total amount paid in installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. Adding the advance payment, the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

"In the context of a class of 200 students divided into three groups, we are tasked with determining the number of students in the smallest group. The problem states that two of the groups are equal in number, and the third group, being the smallest, contains 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

To solve this problem, we must first establish an equation representing the total number of students in the class. Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as 'x'. Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group would be 'x - 10'.

The total number of students in the class is the sum of the students in all three groups, which equals 200. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms, we get:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation yields:

3x = 210

Dividing both sides by 3 results in:

x = 70

Now that we have determined the number of students in each of the two equal groups, we can calculate the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from 'x':

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the total number of legs of the animals on Farmer Brown's farm, we must first establish the number of cows and chickens. Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H.

Given that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can express this relationship as H = 2C. Additionally, we know that the total number of animals is 60, which can be represented as H + C = 60.

By substituting H = 2C into the second equation, we get 2C + C = 60, simplifying to 3C = 60. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3 yields C = 20.

Now that we have the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by multiplying C by 2, resulting in H = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

Therefore, the total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of balls Josh has left to juggle, we must first calculate the total number of balls he had initially. Since Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks, we can calculate the total number of balls as follows:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added) = 7 balls

However, during the performance, Josh drops 3 balls. Two of them are caught by the audience, but one is lost. To find the number of balls Josh has left, we subtract the lost ball from the total:

7 (total balls) - 1 (lost ball) = 6 balls

Therefore, Josh starts juggling with 6 balls.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, we must first establish the weights of each animal involved.

The pink frog's weight serves as a reference point. Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can deduce the weights of the other animals based on the provided information.

The blue beetle and the green toad weigh the same as the pink frog, so they also weigh 50 pounds each.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, which equates to 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

Conversely, the red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, resulting in a weight of 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight by adding the weights of the animals and the container:

50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds

Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds.

Laurel initially received 24 baby outfits from her friend. Subsequently, she received twice that amount at her baby shower, which equates to 48 outfits. Furthermore, her mother gifted her an additional 15 outfits.

To calculate the total number of outfits, we must add these amounts together: 24 (initial outfits) + 48 (baby shower outfits) + 15 (gift from her mother) = 87 outfits.

Therefore, the total number of outfits Laurel has for her baby is 87."
"To determine the total distance covered by Tyson in June, we must first calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice.

The coach wants Tyson to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find this additional distance, we divide the original daily distance by 5. 

The original daily distance is 5000 meters. 

1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters.

Therefore, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

"In the context of a restaurant's furniture inventory, determining the total number of legs is a straightforward calculation. We have two categories of tables: those with 4 legs and those with 3 legs.

First, we calculate the total number of legs for the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.

Next, we calculate the total number of legs for the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.

To find the overall total, we add the number of legs from both categories: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs in the restaurant's tables is 310."
"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we must first calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, which equates to 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband consumes 1 cookie daily for 7 days, totaling 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The combined total of cookies eaten by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Given that a bag contains 36 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies remaining for Jenny by subtracting the total consumed by her son and husband from the total in the bag: 36 - 27 = 9.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To determine the total cost of the shirts, we must first calculate the discount amount. The discount is 40% of the original price of $30.

The discount amount is calculated as follows: 40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to obtain the discounted price of one shirt.

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos purchased 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to find the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2 = $36

Therefore, the total amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is $36."
"To determine the percentage increase in the amount the factory makes per day, we must first calculate the difference in their daily earnings before and after switching from manufacturing tractors to silos.

The factory sold 10 tractors per day at $100 per tractor, resulting in a daily revenue of 10 * $100 = $1000.

Currently, the factory sells 5 silos per day at $220 per silo, resulting in a daily revenue of 5 * $220 = $1100.

The difference in daily revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To calculate the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the factory's daily revenue has increased by 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total annual expenditure on the dog, we must first calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply by 12.

The cost of food per month is calculated as follows: 
Food cost per week = $25
Number of weeks in a month = 4
Food cost per month = $25 * 4 = $100

Adding the monthly costs of treats and medicine to the food cost, we get:
Total cost per month = $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine)
Total cost per month = $220

To find the total annual expenditure, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
Total cost per year = Total cost per month * 12
Total cost per year = $220 * 12
Total cost per year = $2640

Therefore, the total annual expenditure on the dog is $2640."
"To determine the total time Peyton's after-work activities will take, we must calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

Peyton's yoga class on Monday lasts for 1 hour. The cooking class on Tuesday is three times as long as the yoga class, which equates to 3 hours. The cheese-tasting event on Wednesday is a half-hour long, or 0.5 hours. The museum tour on Thursday takes half the time of the cooking class, which is 1.5 hours. Lastly, Peyton has 2 hours of errands scheduled for Friday.

To find the total time, we add the duration of each activity together: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

Therefore, Peyton's after-work activities will take a total of 7.5 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we must first calculate the total number of plant pots she requires. For the daisies, she needs 30 plant pots. Additionally, she needs twice as many for the roses, which equates to 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots.

Therefore, the total number of plant pots she needs is 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April had already purchased 100 plant pots prior to knowing the exact number she required, we can calculate the number of plant pots she has left over by subtracting the total number of plant pots needed from the number she purchased: 100 - 90 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we must first establish the sequence of events. Andrea initially possessed $36. Following this, she incurred an expenditure of $11 for a sweater. Consequently, her remaining funds were $36 - $11 = $25.

Subsequently, Andrea gifted her brother $4, resulting in a further reduction of her funds to $25 - $4 = $21.

To calculate the amount Andrea saved, we must subtract the final amount she possessed from the initial amount. This yields $36 - $21 = $15.

Therefore, the amount Andrea saved is $15."
"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we must first calculate the total time he spent on his vacation. 

We know that John spent 6 hours boating and half that time, which is 3 hours, swimming. Additionally, he watched 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, totaling 6 hours. 

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

However, we are informed that the time spent watching shows constitutes 30% of the total time. We can use this information to calculate the total time spent on the vacation.

Let's denote the total time as 'T'. Then, 30% of T is equal to 6 hours. We can express this as an equation:

0.30 * T = 6

To find the total time, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.30:

T = 6 / 0.30
T = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:

Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 * 20
= 8 hours

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the amount Annabelle still needs to save for the phone, we must first calculate her total earnings from both jobs and then subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work, resulting in a total of $200. 

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work, resulting in a total of $75.

Her total earnings from both jobs are $200 + $75 = $275.

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. To find out how much more she needs, we subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $275 = $125.

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we must first calculate the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet. The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, which is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

According to the problem, the height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"In the context of Dean's financial transactions, we must first determine the total amount he spent on the toy cars and teddy bears. The cost of the toy cars is calculated as 6 units * $2 per unit, which equals $12. Similarly, the cost of the teddy bears is 5 units * $1 per unit, totaling $5.

The combined cost of the toy cars and teddy bears is $12 + $5, which equals $17. 

Dean initially received $28 from his mother. Following her generosity, he received an additional $10, bringing his total to $28 + $10 = $38.

To determine the amount of money Dean has left, we must subtract the total amount he spent from the total amount he has. Therefore, $38 - $17 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we must first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. 

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $35 = 1.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.57 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $55 - $5 = $50. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$50 / $35 = 1.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.43 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $50 - $20 = $30. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$30 / $35 = 0.86

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.86 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the mini-golf in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $30 - $5 = $25.

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.57 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $20 - $5 = $15.

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.29 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $10 - $5 = $5. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$5 / $35 = 0.14

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.14 ≈ 0

"To determine the amount of money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we must first calculate her daily savings. 

Marisa receives $5 as pocket money daily and purchases 4 lollipops at $0.25 each. The total cost of the lollipops is 4 x $0.25 = $1. 

Subtracting the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money, we find her daily savings to be $5 - $1 = $4.

To calculate her total savings over 5 days, we multiply her daily savings by the number of days: $4 x 5 = $20.

Therefore, Marisa saves $20 in her piggy bank over 5 days.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the amount of candy Billy purchased, we must first establish the sequence of events and the relevant financial transactions.

Billy initially possessed $10, which was provided by his father. He then utilized this sum to acquire candy at a cost of $1.5 per pound. The remaining funds after this purchase will be denoted as $10 - 1.5x, where x represents the pounds of candy purchased.

Following the acquisition of candy, Billy allocated half of his remaining funds towards the purchase of gumballs, which cost $0.05 each. Given that he acquired 40 gumballs, the total expenditure on gumballs amounts to 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy allocated half of his remaining funds towards gumballs, we can express this as (10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2. Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction yields 10 - 1.5x = 4.

To isolate x, we subtract 10 from both sides, resulting in -1.5x = -6. Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us x = 4.

Therefore, Billy purchased 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the age of Carver's son, we must analyze the given information. It is stated that Carver is 45 years old, which is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as an equation:

2x - 5 = 45

Where 'x' represents the son's age. To find the value of 'x', we need to solve for it. First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

(2x) / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, the son's age is 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of days between services for the train, we must first calculate the total distance traveled in one trip and then divide that by the distance required for service.

The train travels from the first city to the second city, which is 75 miles. From the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 175 miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, we calculate the total distance traveled in one trip by adding the distances between the cities: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip three times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 miles * 3 = 900 miles.

The train requires service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To determine the amount of stuffing required for Mark's custom dog beds, we must first establish the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed. A bed for a Rottweiler requires 8 pounds of stuffing, while a bed for a chihuahua requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

A bed for a collie, being the average of the first two, necessitates the calculation of the mean. This is achieved by adding the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua, then dividing by 2. 
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

With the amount of stuffing for each type of bed established, we can now calculate the total amount of stuffing required for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 
Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the total duration of John's trip, we must first calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey.

The initial leg of the trip involves driving to his friend's house, which is 200 miles away at a speed of 70 mph. We can calculate the time taken for this leg using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time taken to drive to friend's house = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.857 hours (approximately).

However, John had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. To find the total distance driven to his friend's house, we add the detour to the original distance: 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles.

Time taken to drive to friend's house with the detour = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

For the return trip, John drives 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph. Using the same formula, we can calculate the time taken for the return trip:

Time taken to drive back home = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

To find the total time taken for the trip, we add the time taken for each leg: 3 hours (to friend's house) + 3 hours (back home) = 6 hours.

Therefore, the total duration of John's trip is 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we must first establish the total number of students present and then isolate the number of boys.

The total number of fourth-graders at Small Tree School is 96. On Friday, a total of 9 students were absent, consisting of 5 girls and 4 boys. 

To find the number of students present, we subtract the total number of absent students from the total number of fourth-graders: 96 - 9 = 87.

Next, we calculate the number of girls present by subtracting the number of absent girls from the total number of girls: 43 - 5 = 38.

Finally, to find the number of boys present, we subtract the number of girls present from the total number of students present: 87 - 38 = 49.

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we must first establish the ratio of boys to girls. The problem states that there are twice the number of boys as girls. Given that there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

The number of boys is 2 * 6 = 12.

To find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of boys to the number of girls: 6 (girls) + 12 (boys) = 18.

Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"In the context of academic promotion, a student's cumulative test scores are often subject to a minimum threshold. In this case, Jane must achieve a total of at least 42 points across three tests to be promoted to the next school year.

Given that Jane has already scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test, we can calculate the minimum points required on the third test to meet the threshold.

Total required points = 42
Points scored in the first test = 15
Points scored in the second test = 18

Points scored so far = 15 + 18 = 33
Points needed on the third test = Total required points - Points scored so far
= 42 - 33
= 9

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass is 9.

"To determine the number of individuals kicked out of the Walmart for reasons other than refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence, we must first establish the total number of individuals kicked out for these specific reasons.

Pursuant to the information provided, three individuals were removed for refusing to wear masks. 

Furthermore, the number of individuals removed for shoplifting is four times the number removed for refusing to wear masks, minus five. This equates to 4 * 3 - 5 = 7 individuals.

Additionally, the number of individuals removed for physical violence is three times the number removed for shoplifting, which is 3 * 7 = 21 individuals.

The total number of individuals removed for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence is 3 + 7 + 21 = 31.

Given that a total of 50 individuals were removed from the Walmart, the number of individuals removed for other reasons is 50 - 31 = 19.

Therefore, the number of individuals removed for other reasons is 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the number of points Erin had before, we must first establish the current relationship between Erin's and Sara's points. It is stated that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. This implies that Erin's current points are 3 times Sara's points, which equals 24 points.

However, it is also given that Erin currently has 14 points. To find the number of points Erin had before, we must calculate the difference between the total points Erin had before and the points she has now.

The total points Erin had before can be calculated by adding the points she has now to the points she had before. Since Erin has 14 points now and 3 times Sara's points, we can set up the equation as follows:

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points - Erin's points before
14 = 3 * 8 - Erin's points before

To find Erin's points before, we can rearrange the equation:

Erin's points before = 3 * 8 - 14
Erin's points before = 24 - 14
Erin's points before = 10

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we must consider the expenses associated with the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, we calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. Therefore, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we must consider the cost of etching the logo onto each frame. The etching costs 20% of the frame's cost, which is $4 per frame. With 44 frames, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

The total cost of the picture frames and etching is then $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, two seniors will receive pins at a cost of $5 each. Therefore, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Furthermore, one-fourth of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord at a cost of $12. Therefore, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Finally, we calculate the total cost of all the gifts by adding the costs of the picture frames and etching, the pins, and the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To determine the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we must first calculate the materials cost. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

A 20% savings implies that the DIY method reduces the cost by 20% of the original price. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

Therefore, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we must first calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then account for the returns.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:
50 * 2 = 100

"In the context of a commercial transaction, a buyer's right to return defective goods is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and other applicable laws. When a buyer returns defective goods, the seller is generally obligated to refund the purchase price or replace the defective goods with functioning ones.

In this scenario, the company purchased $400,000 worth of equipment from a retailer, but 40% of the equipment was found to be faulty. To determine the amount spent on functioning equipment, we must first calculate the value of the defective equipment.

The value of the defective equipment is 40% of the total purchase price, which is $400,000. To calculate this, we multiply the total purchase price by the percentage of defective equipment:

$400,000 * 0.4 = $160,000

This represents the value of the defective equipment. To find the amount spent on functioning equipment, we subtract the value of the defective equipment from the total purchase price:

$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000

Therefore, the company spent $240,000 on functioning equipment.

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To determine the total amount of milk collected by Mary, we must first identify the number of sheep from which she collects milk from each category. 

She collects 1 kg of milk from half of her sheep, which is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep. 
She collects 2 kg of milk from the other half of her sheep, which is also 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

Now, we calculate the total milk collected from each category: 
- 15 sheep * 1 kg = 15 kg
- 15 sheep * 2 kg = 30 kg

Adding these amounts together, we find that Mary collects a total of 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk every day.

"To determine the number of pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we must first calculate the number of rolls remaining after feeding her children. 

Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. She fed 6 children, so she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of pieces created from these remaining rolls. Since each roll was broken into 8 pieces, we multiply the number of remaining rolls by 8. 

6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces of rolls.

Therefore, the correct answer is that Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we must first calculate the number of pupils who like blue and green.

Half of the class likes blue, which is 40 / 2 = 20 pupils.

The remaining pupils who do not like blue are 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, which is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.

Therefore, the total number of pupils who like blue and green is 20 (blue) + 5 (green) = 25 pupils.

To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils: 40 - 25 = 15.

Chloe's speed was 9 kilometers per hour, and she hiked for 5 hours. Therefore, Chloe's total distance is 9 kilometers per hour * 5 hours = 45 kilometers.

To find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance: 112 kilometers - 45 kilometers = 67 kilometers.

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

The final answer is: 67"
"To determine the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we must first calculate the individual amounts of silver and gold pesos each possesses.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna, on the other hand, has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which equates to 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. Additionally, she has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, totaling 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Combining their silver pesos, we get 50 (Axel's silver pesos) + 100 (Anna's silver pesos) = 150 silver pesos.

Similarly, combining their gold pesos, we get 80 (Axel's gold pesos) + 120 (Anna's gold pesos) = 200 gold pesos.

Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is 150 (silver pesos) + 200 (gold pesos) = 350.

"To determine the profit per hour that Millie will make from her lemonade stand, we must first calculate the total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, we calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she purchased. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Given that she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. Therefore, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can make 36 cups in total, she will spend 36 / 4 = 9 hours selling all the lemonade.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

Therefore, the profit per hour that Millie will make from her lemonade stand is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we must consider the fraction of land he retained after the sale. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his original land. This remaining portion is stated to be 12.8 hectares.

To calculate the initial amount of land, we can set up a proportion:

2/5 of x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we must first establish the number of female members in the choir. Given that the choir consists of 52 members, with 50% being boys and 50% being girls, we can calculate the number of girls as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

However, on the day of the performance, half of the female members were unable to attend due to their bus breaking down. Therefore, we must calculate half of 26, which is 26 / 2 = 13.

In addition to the remaining female members, the choir's 3 teachers also decided to sing with them. To find the total number of people who sang in the performance, we add the remaining female members to the number of teachers: 26 - 13 + 3 = 16.

Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 16.

"To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we must first calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we must first calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply these quantities by 4.

Total flour required = 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Total milk required = 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so we divide the total amount of flour required by the amount of flour in each bag to find the number of bags Mark needs to buy.

Number of bags of flour = 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so we divide the total amount of milk required by the amount of milk in each bottle to find the number of bottles Mark needs to buy.

Number of bottles of milk = 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour.

"To determine the amount of electric energy Mel will save by reducing the usage of his 900-watt air conditioner, we must first calculate the original energy consumption and the new energy consumption.

The original energy consumption per day is calculated by multiplying the wattage of the air conditioner by the number of hours it is used. In this case, 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new energy consumption per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new energy consumption, which is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

Therefore, the total energy saved in 30 days is 135 kWh.

"To determine the total cost of the ingredients for the muffaletta sandwiches, we must first calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. 

Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

Given that each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, the total amount of each ingredient needed is 5 pounds.

The cost of the meat is calculated by multiplying the total pounds of meat by the cost per pound: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.

Similarly, the cost of the cheese is calculated by multiplying the total pounds of cheese by the cost per pound: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Therefore, the total cost of the ingredients for the muffaletta sandwiches is $50.00.

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To determine the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we must first establish the initial quantities of each item. 

We know that Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis. Given that he has a total of 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, Allan purchased 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we calculate the total number of corns and cannolis by adding the initial quantities to the quantities purchased: 
Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns purchased: 20
Cannolis purchased: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we must first calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he aims to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine the time Toby will arrive at the airport, we must first calculate the time it takes him to read the book. Given that the book contains 45 pages and each page averages 200 words, the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby's reading rate is 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time it takes him to read the book is 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.

Additionally, it takes Toby 10 minutes to travel to the airport. Consequently, the total time Toby will spend on reading and traveling is 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

Since Toby must arrive at the airport in 60 minutes, we can calculate the time by which he will arrive early by subtracting the total time spent from the required arrival time: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

Therefore, Toby will arrive 20 minutes early at the airport.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we must first calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, resulting in a total of 160 hours worked per employee. With a wage of $15 per hour, the total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. Consequently, the total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, leaving 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, resulting in a total of 160 hours worked per employee. With a wage of $15 per hour, the total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. Therefore, the total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

$168,000"
"To determine the amount of money Sally has left, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

The taffy sale is a two-for-one deal, where one pound of taffy is sold at the regular price of $3, and the second pound is sold at half the regular price, which is $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

In addition to the taffy, Sally also purchased a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each, totaling 4 x $0.25 = $1.

The total cost of the items purchased is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally initially had $10. After subtracting the total cost of the items purchased, she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

Therefore, the correct answer is $3."
"To determine the total amount spent by Tim on fireworks, we must first calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework, then apply the discount.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that amount, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

A 20% discount is applied to the fireworks, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is $960 (fireworks) + $150 (finale firework) = $1110.

Therefore, the total amount spent by Tim is $1110.

**The final answer is: $1110**"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she will consume over the 30-day period. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night. Over 30 nights, she will consume:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe yields 1 dozen (12) cookies, we must divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to determine the number of dozens she needs to make:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

Therefore, Shannon must prepare 5 dozen cookies to ensure she has a sufficient supply for 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we must first identify the subset of candles that are more prone to exploding. Given that 1% of the candles are more dangerous, we calculate this as 0.01 * 50000 = 500 candles.

Next, we need to find the number of candles within this subset that also smell like wet dog. The problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles have this characteristic. Therefore, we calculate this as 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles.

Thus, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more prone to exploding is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we must first calculate the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

Subtracting the discount from the regular price yields the discounted price of each blouse: $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha purchases 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"In the context of this problem, we are dealing with a scenario where two individuals, Joanne and her sister, are gathering apples from their family's orchard. The information provided indicates that Joanne gathers a certain number of apples from the tallest and shortest trees, while her sister gathers a different number of apples from the same trees. The sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

To begin, let's establish the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the tallest trees as 30. Her sister, on the other hand, gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which equates to 60 apples. 

Moving on to the shortest trees, Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, resulting in 15 apples. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which amounts to 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is comprised of the apples from the tallest, shortest, and average trees. Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the average trees as 'x'. Therefore, the total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.

In contrast, the total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

Given that the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, we can establish the equation 45 + x + 105 = 500 to solve for the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees.

Solving for x, we have:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

Therefore, the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees is 350.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To determine the number of dromedaries in the herd, we must first establish the relationship between the number of camels and dromedaries based on the information provided. The total number of heads in the herd is 180, and the total number of bumps (humps) is 304.

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can create two equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of heads (camels and dromedaries) is 180:
   C + D = 180

2. The total number of humps (bumps) is 304:
   2C + D = 304

To solve for the number of dromedaries, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, the number of dromedaries in the herd is 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip, we must calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the trip and then sum those distances.

First, we calculate the distance traveled in the initial four days. Since Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, the total distance for this period is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we calculate the distance traveled over the subsequent two days. During this period, Tom covered 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.30:
(0.30) * 800 km = 240 km
Therefore, the total distance traveled in the next two days is 240 km.

On the following day, Tom did not travel, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. Since there are seven days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we sum the distances traveled in each segment of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we must first establish the relationship between the lockers. Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. This implies that Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker.

Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches.

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker must be twice the size of Zack's locker. Consequently, Timothy's locker is 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 40"
"In this scenario, we have two individuals, Stanley and Oliver, with different elevations on a mountain. To determine the distance Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's current elevation.

Stanley's comb fell from an initial elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge below, resulting in a final elevation of 6,000 feet. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

To find the distance Oliver must climb, we subtract his current elevation from the elevation of the comb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"In this scenario, Mr. Josue initially possessed $5000 in capital. He then received $4000 from the first bank. The second bank, however, provided him with twice the amount received from the first bank, which equates to $8000.

To determine the total capital Mr. Josue now possesses, we must calculate the aggregate amount received from both banks and add it to his initial capital. The total amount received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue now possesses is $5000 (initial capital) + $12000 (amount received from the banks) = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To determine the number of cats left on the rock, we must analyze the given information and apply logical reasoning.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats arrived and removed 5 cats each, resulting in a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats being taken away.

The remaining number of cats on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30.

Subsequently, 3/5 of the remaining cats pursued a mouse. To calculate the number of cats that chased the mouse, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the service, we must first break down the pricing structure into its various components. The service initially offers a discounted rate of $8 per month for the first 6 months. Following this introductory period, the rate increases to $12 per month for 8 months. Finally, the rate rises to $14 per month for the remaining months.

The cost for the initial 6 months can be calculated as follows: 6 months * $8/month = $48.

Next, we calculate the cost for the subsequent 8 months at the rate of $12 per month: 8 months * $12/month = $96.

Lastly, we determine the cost for the remaining months at the rate of $14 per month. Since the total duration of the service is 24 months, and we have already accounted for 6 + 8 = 14 months, the remaining months are 24 - 14 = 10 months. Therefore, the cost for the remaining months is 10 months * $14/month = $140.

To find the total cost for 2 years of the service, we add the costs for each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"To determine the cost difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, we must first establish the cost of each item. 

Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. We know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can express this relationship as J = T - 6.

We are also given that the total savings from purchasing both items is $6. Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 2/3 from the tattered jeans. This can be expressed as (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Substituting J from the first equation into the second equation, we get (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6. Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction yields T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we get 3T - 6 = 18. Adding 6 to both sides results in 3T = 24. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans by substituting T into the equation J = T - 6. This gives us J = 8 - 6 = 2.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we must calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and sum them together.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses: 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses: 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

Lastly, we calculate the capacity of the minivans: 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we must first establish the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Lillian made 3 bird feeders, and each of these attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which attract 20 birds each. Therefore, the homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian bought 3 of them. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150.

Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 150.

The final answer is: 150"

The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

Therefore, the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner is $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To determine the number of Pokémon cards Kenny started with, we must first establish the amount of money he needs to raise from selling the cards. Since the amusement park ticket costs $100 and Kenny has $50 in spending cash, he requires $50 to purchase the ticket.

Given that each card is sold for $1.5, we can calculate the number of cards he sold by dividing the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5 = 33.33 (round down to 33 since you can't sell a fraction of a card)

However, Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. 

Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.33

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 Pokémon cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we must first establish the total number of hotdogs prepared by the caterer. 

The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs, which equates to 18 guests. This results in 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for these 18 guests. 

Additionally, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for the other half of the guests (also 18) to have one hotdog each, totaling 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for these 18 guests. 

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, when 40 guests arrived, each wanting a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs required became 40 * 2 = 80. 

Given that there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were insufficient. Consequently, 26 guests did not receive a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we must first calculate the number of letters in her sister's name. 

We know that her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. Since Indras' name has 6 letters, half of that is 3. 

Therefore, her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

To find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name: 6 + 7 = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order, we must first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount is applied. This involves adding the cost of the set of pot and pans, the set of mixing bowls, and the cost of the 5 separate utensils.

The set of pot and pans costs $120.00, the set of mixing bowls costs $20.00, and the 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each. Therefore, the total cost of the utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we must calculate the discount, which is 20% of the total cost before the discount. This can be calculated as 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

To find the total cost after the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Therefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount is $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To determine the amount of money Dora needs to purchase the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she wishes to acquire.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Therefore, the total cost of the items is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, which amounts to $18.

To calculate the amount of money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to purchase the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we must first establish the number of dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew.

Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is 75.

Prince Walter, wielding a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, employed a nail file to slay one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Consequently, Prince Bruce slew 150 / 5 = 30 dragons.

Therefore, the correct answer is 30."
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed to run her lawnmower, we must first establish the volume of gas in one container. Given that 15 gallons were equally divided among 5 containers, each container contains 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equivalent to 8 pints, we can convert the 3 gallons in one container to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Josey required 1/4 of a container to operate her lawnmower. To find the volume of gas needed, we calculate 1/4 of 3 gallons.

1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons

Converting 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 0.75 by 8 yields:

0.75 * 8 = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of candy bars George purchased, we must first establish the total amount of money he spent on candy bars. 

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. This implies that he spent 99% of his money. Therefore, the amount spent on candy bars can be calculated as follows:

1. 1% of $5 is $0.05 (one cent).
2. 99% of $5 is $4.95.
3. The cost of 3 bags of chips is $1.20.
4. The amount of money George spent on chips is $1.20.
5. The amount of money George spent on candy bars is $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.
6. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars George bought is $3.75 / 0.75 = 5.

Therefore, the correct answer is 5.

"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a simple division problem to determine the equitable distribution of lollipops among Ray's friends. 

To begin, we must first identify the total number of lollipops Ray had initially, which is 25. He then retained 5 lollipops for himself, leaving 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops to be distributed among his friends.

Given that there are 4 friends, we can now calculate the number of lollipops each friend will receive by dividing the remaining lollipops by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

Therefore, each of Ray's friends will receive 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we must first establish the total weight of the cake and the number of pieces it was divided into. The cake weighs 20 ounces and was cut into 8 equal pieces.

Given that each piece is of equal weight, we can calculate the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Rory and her mom each consumed one piece, resulting in a total of 2 pieces being eaten. To find the total weight of the cake consumed, we multiply the weight of each piece by the number of pieces eaten.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

Therefore, the weight of the remaining cake is 15 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"

"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we must first calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide that by the number of servings.

The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but Antoine wants to double that amount. Therefore, he needs 4 pounds of onions. Given that the onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, the total cost of the onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

In addition to the onions, Antoine requires 2 boxes of beef stock, each costing $2.00. Therefore, the total cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the cost of the beef stock, which is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we can calculate the cost per serving by dividing the total cost of the ingredients by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Therefore, the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is $2.00.

"To determine the time difference in departure for Bernadette and Wayne, we must first establish the time it takes for each of them to arrive at the theater. 

Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Given that Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we must calculate the time she needs to leave in relation to Wayne's arrival. 

To do this, we need to find the time Bernadette needs to leave before Wayne. Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, and she needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne to arrive at the theater first.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we must first establish the dimensions of the room. The area of the room is given as 360 square feet, and the length is provided as 3 yards. However, to maintain uniformity in our calculations, we must convert the length from yards to feet.

1 yard is equivalent to 3 feet. Therefore, 3 yards is equivalent to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

With the length in feet, we can now calculate the width of the room using the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = length * width. Rearranging the formula to solve for width, we get width = Area / length.

Substituting the given values, we have width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Substituting the values, we get Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

Therefore, the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the disparity in the number of beads between the two sisters, we must first calculate the total number of beads each sister possesses.

Elizabeth acquired one pack of red beads and two packs of clear beads. Given that each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, her total is as follows:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth, on the other hand, purchased three packs of blue beads and four packs of red beads. With each pack containing 20 pieces of beads, her total is:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

To establish the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we subtract the total number of beads Elizabeth has from the total number of beads Margareth has:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

Therefore, the correct answer is: 80"
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we must consider the effects of the oven and the open window on the temperature.

First, we calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Next, we calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so for 30 minutes, it cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. We add the temperature increase due to the oven (15 degrees) and subtract the temperature decrease due to the open window (6 degrees) from the initial temperature.

Therefore, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To determine the time it took James to complete the run, we must first calculate his total time for the triathlon. 

We know that James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon, which means his swim time is 90% of Jon's swim time. Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James' swim time is 0.9 * 40 = 36 minutes.

We also know that James took 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's calculate James' total time for the triathlon. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. Therefore, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

To find James' run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time. James' run time is 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"To determine the length of Movie A, we must first establish the length of Movie C, which is given as 1.25 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Next, we are informed that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, Movie B's length is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Now, we are told that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4: 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

Therefore, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the amount of change Michael has after purchasing hay for his horse, we must first calculate the total cost of the hay. 

The horse runs for 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour. To find the distance traveled, we convert the time from minutes to hours: 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Using the formula Distance = Speed * Time, we find that the distance traveled is 32 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse consumes 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total hay consumed is 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 bails * $3/bail = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, totaling $30. To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

Therefore, the change Michael has after purchasing hay for his horse is $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we must first calculate the total number of eggs available.

"To determine the salesman's profit, we must first calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of the sneakers. 

The salesman sold 17 sneakers at a flash sale on Monday for $20 each, resulting in revenue of 17 x $20 = $340.

The remaining sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each. Since there were 48 sneakers initially and 17 were sold at the flash sale, 31 sneakers were sold to the department store. The revenue from this sale is 31 x $25 = $775.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale, which is $340 + $775 = $1115.

To find the profit, we must subtract the initial cost of the sneakers, which was $576, from the total revenue. Therefore, the profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.

The final answer is: $539"
"To determine the total number of crayons purchased by Beatrice, we must first calculate the number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces each and the packets with 16 pieces each.

The six packets with 8 pieces each contain a total of 6 * 8 = 48 crayons.
The four packets with 16 pieces each contain a total of 4 * 16 = 64 crayons.

To find the total number of crayons, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, the total number of crayons purchased by Beatrice is 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"To determine the regular price of popcorn, let's analyze the given information. 

We have two options: 

1. A super ticket for $20 that includes a movie, a soda, and a popcorn for $1 extra.
2. A regular ticket for $12 and a separate purchase of a movie, a soda, and a popcorn.

Given that the soda costs $3, we can calculate the cost of the popcorn by comparing the two options. If we buy the regular ticket and don't buy the super ticket, we save $2.

The difference in cost between the two options is $20 (super ticket) - $12 (regular ticket) = $8. However, we also know that we save $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means the remaining difference of $8 - $2 = $6 is the cost of the popcorn and the soda in the super ticket.

Since the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn is $6 - $3 = $3.

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's re-evaluate the situation: 

If we buy the regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If we buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

$2"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after a price increase, we must first establish the original cost per balloon. 

Given that the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the original cost per balloon by dividing the total cost by the number of balloons: $900 / 20 = $45 per balloon.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20, making the new cost per balloon $45 + $20 = $65.

To find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons: $65 * 170 = $11,050.

Therefore, the total cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase is $11,050."
"To determine the average speed of the car during the trip, we must first calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, covering a distance of 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles. Subsequently, it travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, covering a distance of 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles.

The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances, which is 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the time spent traveling at each speed, which is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

Therefore, the average speed of the car during the trip is 50 mph.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

Finally, we can calculate the total number of cards by summing the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards in the set is 78.

The final answer is: 78"

B) 30%
C) 35%
D) 40%

The final answer is: C) 35%"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make to transport the feed, we must first calculate the total weight of the feed. 

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds. The weight of the carrots is 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds. The weight of the hay is 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds. The weight of the oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

To find the number of trips, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity of 2250 pounds.

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we must round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total earnings from recycling in a four-week month, we must first calculate the weekly earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles.

Grayson consumes three aluminum cans of soda per week, each worth two cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

Similarly, she consumes five plastic bottles of water per week, each worth three cents. Thus, the weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

Combining the earnings from both sources, Grayson's total weekly earnings are 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week.

To find the total earnings for a four-week month, we multiply the weekly earnings by the number of weeks: 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month.

Therefore, the total earnings from recycling in a four-week month is 84 cents."
"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we must first establish the number of plants Toni possesses. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's total as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

With Toni's total established, we can now calculate Shondra's plants by subtracting 7 from Toni's total.

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

Therefore, the correct answer is 9."

"In the context of this scenario, we have a conditional agreement between Matt and his father. The terms of the agreement stipulate that Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This arrangement can be expressed as a mathematical equation.

Let 'x' represent the number of carrot sticks Matt consumes. The number of cookies he is entitled to is then calculated as (1/2)x + 2. Given that Matt desires to consume a total of five cookies, we can establish the following equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To determine the value of 'x', we must isolate the variable. This can be achieved by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, the number of carrot sticks Matt must consume to satisfy the conditions of the agreement is 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we must first calculate the combined length of the remoras. Since the remoras are 6 inches long and there are two of them, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet
Combined length of remoras = 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

Therefore, the correct answer is 10%."

"To determine how many days Jason has to walk in total in 3 weeks, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we need to divide the total number of days by 4 to find out how many days he has to walk each week.

21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days, but we need to find out how many days he has to walk each day.

To find out how many days he has to walk each day, we need to divide the total number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week) and then multiply by 4 (since he can walk 4 days a week).

21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks
3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find out how many days he has to walk each day. To do this, we need to divide the total number of days by 4 (since he can walk 4 days a week).

12 days / 4 days/week = 3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days, but we need to find out how many days he has to walk each day.

To find out how many days he has to walk each day, we need to divide the total number of days by 4 (since he can walk 4 days a week).

12 days / 4 days/week = 3

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find out how many days he has to walk each day. To do this, we need to divide the total number of days by 4 (since he can walk 4 days a week).

240 minutes / 4 days/week = 60 minutes/day * 4 days/week = 240 minutes, but we need to find out how many days he has to walk each day.

240 minutes / 60 minutes/day = 4 days

The correct answer is 4 days."
"To determine the number of books each child received, we must first calculate the total number of books purchased by Sarah.

The total amount spent on books is $300, and each book costs $15. 

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah distributed the books equally among her 4 children, we must divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books each child received = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child received = 20 / 4
Number of books each child received = 5

Therefore, each child received 5 books.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who are not allergic to anything, we must first calculate the total number of kids who are allergic to dairy, peanuts, or both. 

We start by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtract the number allergic to both to avoid double-counting. This is based on the principle of inclusion-exclusion, a fundamental concept in set theory.

The number of kids allergic to dairy is 9, and the number allergic to peanuts is 6. However, 3 kids are allergic to both, so we must subtract this number to avoid counting them twice.

9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything.

32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic kids) = 20

Therefore, the number of kids in Gina's class who are not allergic to anything is 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total number of individuals participating in the tour, we must first calculate the total number of employees and then add the number of tour guides.

There are three groups of employees, each consisting of 200 individuals. Therefore, the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Each group is assigned 7 tour guides, and since there are three groups, the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

To find the total number of people going on the tour, we add the number of employees to the number of tour guides: 600 (employees) + 21 (tour guides) = 621.

Therefore, the total number of people participating in the tour is 621."
"To determine the total cost of the trip, we must first calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for two individuals is $5000 each, resulting in a total of 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel's normal price is $1500 per day. However, due to it being a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. To calculate the new price, we multiply the normal price by 1.2, which equals $1500 * 1.2 = $1800 per day. Since the couple is staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

To find the total cost of the trip, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, resulting in $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To determine the total number of tubes of paint Jasper possesses, we must first establish the quantities of blue and yellow paint he has.

Jasper's blue paint quantity is directly related to Ben's blue paint quantity. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, Jasper's blue paint quantity is 4 / 2 = 2 tubes.

Jasper's yellow paint quantity is three times the amount Ben has. Given that Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, Jasper's yellow paint quantity is 3 * 3 = 9 tubes.

Combining these quantities, Jasper has a total of 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11 tubes of paint.

The final answer is: 11"
"In the case of Belen v. Pennies, we are presented with a dispute regarding the combined weight of two distinct pennies. The 1959 penny, a specimen of its era, weighs 48 grains. The 2010 penny, a more modern variant, is alleged to be three-quarters the weight of its antiquated counterpart.

To determine the weight of the 2010 penny, we must calculate three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. This calculation yields (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains.

Therefore, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains. Consequently, the combined weight of the two pennies is 36 + 48 = 84 grains.

**The final answer is: 84**"
"In this scenario, we are dealing with a straightforward financial calculation to determine the remaining amount required to reach a specific goal. The facts of the case are as follows:

Keegan and Tasha, two individuals operating a car wash to raise funds for a baseball camp, have a collective goal of $200. By 3 pm, Keegan has earned $83, and Tasha has earned $91.

To calculate the remaining amount needed to reach their goal, we must first determine the total amount they have collectively earned. This can be achieved by adding Keegan's earnings to Tasha's earnings.

Total amount earned = $83 (Keegan's earnings) + $91 (Tasha's earnings) = $174

Now, to find the remaining amount needed, we subtract the total amount earned from the collective goal.

Remaining amount needed = $200 (collective goal) - $174 (total amount earned) = $26

Therefore, Keegan and Tasha need to earn an additional $26 to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine the difference in the number of songs each individual can add to their portable media player, we must first establish the number of songs each currently possesses. Gabriel has 20 songs, while Luri has three times as many, which equates to 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Given that each player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs to his player. Conversely, Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player.

The difference in the number of additional songs each can add is 80 - 40 = 40.

Therefore, the correct answer is 40."
"In the context of this wager, we have a clear agreement between Stetson and Alec. The terms of the bet are straightforward: Stetson must relinquish $10 for each orange he consumes. 

To determine the total amount of money Stetson must relinquish, we must first calculate the number of oranges he ate. The total number of oranges picked is 60, and Stetson consumed 2/5 of them.

To find 2/5 of 60, we apply the formula: (2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 oranges.

Now, we multiply the number of oranges Stetson ate by the amount he must relinquish per orange: 24 oranges * $10/orange = $240.

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson must relinquish is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"In the context of this financial transaction, we are presented with a straightforward mathematical problem. To determine the cost of Jillian's handbag, we must first calculate the amount that is three times the cost of her shoes.

The cost of her shoes is $80. Multiplying this by three yields $240.

Next, we must subtract $20 from this amount to find the cost of the handbag.

Cost of handbag = 3 * cost of shoes - $20
= 3 * $80 - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total hours James runs in a week, we must first calculate the total miles he runs in that time frame. Given that James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, we can calculate the total miles run as follows:

Total miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
= 60 miles/week

Next, we need to determine the time it takes James to run 60 miles at a speed of 10 miles per hour. This can be calculated by dividing the total miles run by his speed:

Time = Total miles / Speed
= 60 miles / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours

Therefore, James runs 6 hours a week."
"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we must first calculate the total amount of oats consumed by his horses in that time period.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and Uncle Ben feeds them twice a day. Therefore, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

With four horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Over a five-day period, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats consumed (200 pounds) by the weight of one bag (50 pounds) to find the number of bags needed: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of girl Pomeranians Jana has, we must first establish the total number of Pomeranians. Given that two thirds of Jana's 27 puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Next, we need to calculate the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To determine the average highest temperature of the three countries, we must first calculate the sum of their highest recorded temperatures. 

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48°F, in Northlandia is 21°F, and in Midlandia is -3°F.

Adding these temperatures together yields: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Next, we divide the sum by the number of countries to find the average: -30 / 3 = -10

Therefore, the average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F."
"To determine the number of days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we must first calculate the remaining amount needed to purchase the toy car.

The total cost of the toy car is $12, and the child already has $4 in savings. Therefore, the remaining amount needed is:

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Next, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount.

Daily savings = $2
Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a simple mathematical problem that involves the concept of capacity and limitation. Jaime has 64 eggs and 2 trays, each with a capacity of 24 eggs. To determine the number of eggs that Jaime won't be able to place on the trays, we must first calculate the total capacity of the trays.

The total capacity of the trays is calculated by multiplying the number of trays by the capacity of each tray: 2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs.

Since Jaime has 64 eggs and the trays can only hold 48 eggs, the number of eggs that won't fit on the trays is the difference between the total number of eggs and the total capacity of the trays: 64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs.

Therefore, the correct answer is that Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the trays.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total amount Sally spent on pizzas, we must first establish the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it is stated that the family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we can calculate its cost by multiplying the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent by adding the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

Therefore, the total amount Sally spent on pizzas is $32."
"To determine the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we must first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

The razors are on sale for buy one get one free, which means Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors at $4.00. However, she also has a $2.00 coupon, resulting in a total cost of $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00 for 2 packs of razors.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

Converting the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost of each individual razor after the discount is 25 cents.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the total height of the human pyramid, we must calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

Therefore, the total height of the human pyramid is 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44.67}$"
"To determine the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we must first calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day. Since she walks 5 minutes every hour and works 8 hours a day, the total number of minutes she walks in a day is 5 * 8 = 40 minutes.

To find the total number of minutes she walked in 5 days, we multiply the daily total by the number of days: 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

Therefore, the total number of minutes Charisma walked is 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To determine Angela's current age, we must first establish the relationship between Brett's and Angela's ages in four years. It is given that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now.

Let's denote Brett's current age as B and Angela's current age as A. We know that in four years, Brett will be B + 4 years old, and Angela will be A + 4 years old. According to the problem, A + 4 = 3B.

We are also given that Brett is currently 14 years old. Therefore, B = 14. Substituting this value into the equation A + 4 = 3B, we get A + 4 = 3(14).

Solving for A, we have A + 4 = 42. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get A = 38.

Therefore, Angela's current age is 38 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38}$"

"To determine the number of Greek orange pies that can be made, we must first calculate the total number of oranges available. Ashley brought five boxes, each containing ten oranges, resulting in a total of 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne, on the other hand, brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, which means she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Combining their oranges, they have a total of 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie requires three oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie: 120 / 3 = 40.

Therefore, the total number of Greek orange pies they can make is 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost, we must establish an equation that equates the expenses associated with each venue.

The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, plus an additional $5 per guest for food. Therefore, the total cost for this venue can be expressed as 200 + 5x, where 'x' represents the number of guests.

The second venue charges $25 per guest, with food included in the price. Consequently, the total cost for this venue is 25x.

To find the point at which the costs of both venues are equal, we set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides of the equation yields:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 results in:

10 = x

Therefore, the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of insects Lily found, we must first establish the relationship between the insects collected by each individual. 

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

The total number of insects collected by the three individuals is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combining like terms, we get: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. The equation simplifies to: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides yields: 2B = 36

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can determine the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can calculate the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we must first calculate the individual amounts used by each. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Given that a skein contains 364 yards, we can calculate the yards used by Mariah as follows:
1/4 * 364 = 91 yards

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is equivalent to:
1/2 * 364 = 182 yards

To find the total yards used, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together:
91 + 182 = 273 yards

Therefore, the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma is 273 yards.

The final answer is: 273"
"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we must first calculate the total number of gifts for her friends. Two friends desire five gifts each, resulting in a total of 2 * 5 = 10 gifts. Conversely, three friends desire two gifts each, resulting in a total of 3 * 2 = 6 gifts.

Combining these totals, we find that the friends collectively require 10 + 6 = 16 gifts. Additionally, Cherrie decides to surprise them with 10 more random gifts. Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie purchased is 16 + 10 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine the length of the couch, we must first establish the width of the rug. Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the rug's width can be calculated as follows:

Rug's width = Chair's width + 5
Rug's width = 3 + 5
Rug's width = 8 feet

Next, we calculate the length of the couch, which is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug:

Twice the rug's width = 2 * 8
Twice the rug's width = 16 feet
Couch's length = Twice the rug's width + 2
Couch's length = 16 + 2
Couch's length = 18 feet

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we must first establish the total cost of all the gum packs and then allocate the costs accordingly.

Suzie purchased a total of four packs of gum. Two of these packs are strawberry gum, one is grape gum, and one is green apple gum. The grape gum costs $2, and the green apple gum costs half as much as the grape gum, which is $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3. Since the total cost of all the gum is $7, the remaining cost for the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

As there are two packs of strawberry gum, we divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pack: $4 / 2 = $2.

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the most cost-effective option for Frederick to make popsicle sticks, we must first calculate the number of sticks he can obtain from each type of wood per dollar.

A 2 x 4 piece of wood yields 200 sticks and costs $4, resulting in 200 / 4 = 50 sticks per dollar.
A 2 x 8 piece of wood yields 400 sticks and costs $6, resulting in 400 / 6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar. For the sake of precision, we will round down to 66 sticks per dollar.

Given that 66 sticks per dollar is greater than 50 sticks per dollar, the 2 x 8 piece of wood is the more cost-effective option.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can purchase with his $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood yields 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will yield 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1600}$"
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we must first calculate the total number of snowshoes required. Each dog has four legs, and Mario has six dogs. Therefore, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Next, we must calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Therefore, the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To determine the amount Janet would save by purchasing a weekly bus pass, we must first calculate the total cost of her bus trips in a week.

The total weekly cost of bus trips can be calculated as follows: 

Cost of one bus trip: $2.20
Number of trips in a week: 2 * 5 = 10

Total weekly cost of bus trips: $2.20 * 10 = $22.00

Now, we need to compare this to the cost of a weekly bus pass, which is $20. 

Weekly bus pass cost: $20
Weekly bus trip cost: $22.00

The amount saved by purchasing a weekly bus pass is the difference between the weekly bus trip cost and the weekly bus pass cost.

Amount saved: $22.00 - $20 = $2.00

"To determine the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo, we must first establish the number of cows and sheep at each location. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Given that the farm has 30 cows, the zoo must have 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

Furthermore, the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm must have 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Therefore, the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we must first establish the relationship between the quantities purchased by Sophia and Rose. It is given that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can express this relationship as:

x + y = 4(x + y)

However, this equation is not necessary to solve the problem. We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can directly calculate the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by dividing the quantities purchased by Rose by 4.

Number of onions Sophia bought: 12 / 4 = 3
Number of potatoes Sophia bought: 4 / 4 = 1

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the required daily calorie deficit for Andy to reach his weight loss goal, we must first calculate the total number of days he has to achieve this goal. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5 calories per day.

Therefore, the required daily calorie deficit for Andy to reach his weight loss goal is approximately 614 calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{614}$"
"In the context of a wage dispute, it is essential to calculate an employee's earnings and expenditures to determine the remaining balance. In this scenario, Gerald, a daycare employee, earns a daily wage of $30. To calculate his weekly earnings, we must consider the number of working days in a standard week, which is 7.

Weekly earnings = Daily wage * Number of working days
= $30 * 7
= $210

However, Gerald spent a total of $100 during the week. To determine the remaining balance, we must subtract his expenditures from his earnings.

Remaining balance = Weekly earnings - Expenditures
= $210 - $100
= $110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 remaining."
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total distance she will run. Given that she is required to run 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink. Since she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we can multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer:

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 120 milliliters of water.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the amount of money Julie had left after her purchases, we must first calculate the amount she spent on clothes and then the amount she spent on CDs.

The initial amount of money Julie had was $500. She spent 20% of this amount on clothes. To calculate the amount spent on clothes, we multiply the initial amount by 0.20 (which is equivalent to 20%): 0.20 * $500 = $100. Therefore, the amount of money remaining after purchasing clothes is $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs. To calculate the amount spent on CDs, we multiply the remaining amount by 0.25 (which is equivalent to 25%): 0.25 * $400 = $100. Consequently, the amount of money remaining after purchasing CDs is $400 - $100 = $300.

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the cost of the house, we must first establish the relationship between the cost of the house and the lot. It is given that the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Consequently, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can express this relationship as an equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can now calculate the cost of the house by multiplying 3 by 30,000, which equals $90,000.

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To determine the profit earned by Tara on her canvas bags, we must first calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of packs of canvas bags by the number of bags per pack and the cost per pack. In this case, there were 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, each costing $4. Therefore, the total cost is 8 * 5 * $4 = $160.

Next, we calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of bags sold by the selling price per bag. Tara sold each bag for $8, and she sold a total of 8 * 5 = 40 bags. Therefore, the total revenue is 40 * $8 = $320.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

Therefore, the profit earned by Tara on her canvas bags is $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of punches thrown by Joe, we must first calculate the total duration of the fight. The fight consists of 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes. Therefore, the total duration is 5 rounds * 3 minutes per round = 15 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of punches thrown during this time. Since Joe throws an average of 25 punches per minute, we multiply the total duration by the average number of punches per minute: 15 minutes * 25 punches per minute = 375 punches.

Therefore, the total number of punches thrown by Joe is 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"In this scenario, we are presented with a situation involving a bake-off between three individuals: Kelsie, Josh, and Suzanne. The facts of the case indicate that Suzanne made 36 cookies. 

We are also informed that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. To determine the number of cookies Josh made, we must calculate one-fourth of 36, which is 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.

Furthermore, it is stated that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find the number of cookies Kelsie made, we must multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2. Therefore, Kelsie made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies.

Based on the evidence presented, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we must first calculate the total amount of money he initially possesses. Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total money from the $10 bills is calculated as follows: 4 * $10 = $40.
The total money from the $20 bills is calculated as follows: 6 * $20 = $120.
Therefore, the total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Next, we must calculate the amount of money Ali gives to his sister. Since he gives her half of the total money, we divide the total amount by 2: $160 / 2 = $80.
After giving his sister half of the money, Ali is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, we need to determine the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner. He uses 3/5 of the remaining money, which is calculated as follows: (3/5) * $80 = $48.
Therefore, the amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the time it takes Royce to shingle a house, we must first convert the time it takes Rob to shingle a house into minutes. Rob takes 2 hours, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Given that Royce takes double the time it takes Rob plus 40 minutes, we can calculate Royce's time as follows: (2 * 120) + 40 = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

Therefore, the time it takes Royce to shingle a house is 280 minutes.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool required, we must calculate the total amount needed for each item and then sum those totals.

First, we calculate the number of skeins required for each item:

- Hats: 3 children * 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 children * 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 children * 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 children * 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 children * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins

Now, we add the total number of skeins needed for each item:
6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins

Therefore, the total number of skeins of wool required is 63.

The final answer is: 63"
"To determine the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we must first calculate the total number of problems he completed on Monday and Tuesday, and then subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems. 

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

Therefore, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of problems Chris has to complete is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

The number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 100 - 61 = 39.

The final answer is: 39"
"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm, we must first establish the individual rates at which each of them can pick strawberries.

Tony's rate is 6 quarts per hour. 
Bobby's rate is one less than Tony's, which is 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy's rate is twice that of Bobby's, which is 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky's rate is two fewer quarts than Kathy's, which is 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we calculate the total by adding the individual rates: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm is 29.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread left at the Beverly Hills Bakery, we must consider the total number of loaves baked and the number of loaves sold and returned.

The bakery initially baked 200 loaves of bread. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, resulting in a total of 132 loaves sold. Additionally, 6 unsold loaves were returned by a grocery store.

To calculate the number of loaves left, we subtract the total number of loaves sold and returned from the initial number of loaves baked.

200 (initial loaves) - 132 (loaves sold) - 6 (loaves returned) = 62

Therefore, the correct answer is 62."
"In the context of Jackson's tulip planting endeavor, we must consider the spatial constraints imposed by the tulip arrangement. The key factor here is the number of tulips that can be accommodated in a single row. 

For red tulips, the capacity per row is 6, and Jackson has acquired 36 red tulips. To determine the number of rows for red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the capacity per row: 36 / 6 = 6.

Similarly, for blue tulips, the capacity per row is 8, and Jackson has acquired 24 blue tulips. To determine the number of rows for blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the capacity per row: 24 / 8 = 3.

Considering the whole numbers obtained, Jackson can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we must first establish the total amount of raisins available for the oatmeal cookies. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will receive 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

This leaves 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins for the oatmeal cookies. To calculate the number of batches of oatmeal cookies, we must divide the remaining raisins by the amount required for each batch. A batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins.

To perform this division, we can multiply the number of cups of raisins by the reciprocal of the fraction. Therefore, 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

Therefore, the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make is 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we must first calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Adding a device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour increases her daily consumption to 14 kilowatts per hour.

Weekly consumption before adding the device: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatts per hour
Weekly consumption after adding the device: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatts per hour

The cost per kilowatt hour is $1.50. Therefore, the weekly cost before adding the device is 84 * $1.50 = $126, and the weekly cost after adding the device is 98 * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we must first consider the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can infer that their rate of work is 0.5 houses per 5 days.

To find the rate of work per day for one person, we divide the rate of work by the number of days: 0.5 houses / 5 days = 0.1 houses per day.

Now, we can calculate the rate of work for 5 people by multiplying the rate of work for one person by 5: 0.1 houses per day * 5 people = 0.5 houses per day.

Since 5 people can paint 0.5 houses in one day, they can paint 1 house in 2 days. To convert this to hours, we multiply the number of days by 24: 2 days * 24 hours per day = 48 hours.

Therefore, the correct answer is 48 hours."
"To determine the total number of sofas and chairs in the apartment building, we must first establish the number of chairs and sofas each individual possesses.

Ophelia has 20 sofas. Given that she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can infer that she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna, on the other hand, has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, which equates to 3 * 22 = 66 chairs. Consequently, Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, resulting in 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

To calculate the total number of sofas and chairs, we must add the individual counts together. Ophelia has a total of 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture, while Jenna has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture. Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs in the apartment building is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"To determine the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased if he had not bought the headphone set, we must first calculate the total amount of money he spent on the headphone set.

The total amount spent by Tom is $48, and the cost of the CD is $4. Therefore, the amount spent on the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Next, we calculate the number of CDs Tom could have purchased with the money spent on the headphone set. This is done by dividing the amount spent on the headphone set by the cost of one CD: $44 ÷ $4 = 11 CDs.

Now, we calculate the total number of CDs Tom could have purchased with the money he had, including the cost of the CD: $48 ÷ $4 = 12 CDs.

To find the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased without the headphone set, we subtract the number of CDs he actually purchased from the total number of CDs he could have purchased: 12 - 1 = 11.

However, this is incorrect as we are looking for how many more CDs he could have bought, not how many he could have bought in total. Therefore, we should subtract the number of CDs he bought from the number of CDs he could have bought with the money spent on the headphone set: 11 - 1 = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we must first identify the total hours spent in each category of workout time.

For the weeks where Josh spent 4 hours, we calculate the total hours by multiplying the number of weeks by the hours spent per week. There are 6 weeks where he spent 4 hours.
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

Next, we calculate the total hours for the weeks where Josh spent 5 hours. There are 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

Additionally, we calculate the total hours for the week where Josh spent 6 hours. There is 1 week where he spent 6 hours.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add up the total hours from each category to find the overall total hours spent working out.
24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we must carefully analyze the sequence of events.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 40 passengers. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 40. Therefore, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. Now, we must determine the number of passengers who get on. The problem states that 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 21 passengers got off, 3 times 21 is 63. However, this means 63 fewer passengers get on, not 63 passengers get on. To find the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. This results in -42, indicating that 63 more passengers got on.

Therefore, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin, we must first establish their current ages and then calculate the difference between them.

Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, which means his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years. Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years. Therefore, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.

Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we can calculate the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age:
   Difference = Jame's current age - cousin's current age
             = 22 - 47
             = -25

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference:
   Difference = | -25 |
             = 25

Therefore, the age difference between Jame and his cousin is 25 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the cost of one monitor, we must first establish the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

With the cost of the printer established, we can now calculate the combined cost of the computer and the printer:

Combined cost of computer and printer = Cost of computer + Cost of printer
= $1,100 + $700
= $1,800

Now, we can determine the cost of the two monitors by subtracting the combined cost of the computer and printer from the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer:

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Combined cost of computer and printer
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of the two monitors by 2:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of seashells brought by each girl, we must first establish the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys and each brought 60 seashells, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

Next, we must calculate the number of seashells brought by the girls. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This equates to 60 (the number of seashells brought by the boys) plus 4 * 60 (four times the number of seashells brought by the boys), which is 60 + 240 = 300.

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 600 (the number of seashells brought by the boys) + 300 (the additional seashells brought by the girls), which equals 900.

To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls, which is 10. This results in 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"In this scenario, we are presented with a straightforward mathematical problem that requires us to determine the number of candies Nick possesses. 

To begin, we establish that George had a certain number of candies, which we will denote as 'x'. Consequently, Nick had twice the amount of candies as George, which equates to 2x.

Subsequently, George consumed 5 candies, resulting in him having x - 5 candies remaining. We are informed that George now has 3 candies left, which allows us to form the equation x - 5 = 3.

Solving for x, we find that x = 8. Given that Nick had 2x candies initially, we can now calculate the number of candies Nick possesses by multiplying 2 by 8, yielding 16.

Therefore, the correct answer is that Nick has 16 candies."
"To determine Anne's age, we must first establish the age of Alyana, who is 4 years younger than Chenny. Given that Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Next, we must determine Anne's age, which is 2 years older than Alyana's age. We can calculate Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

"In the context of a legal dispute regarding the thickness of four books on a shelf, it is essential to calculate the total thickness accurately. 

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick. 
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, which makes it 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick. 
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, which makes it 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

To determine the total thickness of the four books, we must add their individual thicknesses together: 
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we must first calculate the total number of vlogs she has already created. 

In the first week, Emma made 18 vlogs. In the second week, she created 21 vlogs. In the third week, she produced 15 vlogs. 

To find the total number of vlogs created, we add these amounts together: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54.

Emma's goal is to create 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to create, we subtract the total number of vlogs she has already made from her goal: 72 - 54 = 18.

Therefore, Emma should create 18 more vlogs to meet her monthly goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the total amount paid, we must first calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the dinner bill, which is $50. 

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Next, we add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount paid.

Total amount = $50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

Therefore, the total amount paid is $60."
"To determine the current amount the eldest boy has, we must analyze the sequence of transactions.

Initially, the eldest boy's share is $18 / 3 = $6. 

He then adds $5 to his share, resulting in $6 + $5 = $11.

Following this, he adds another $10, bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21.

However, he subsequently spends $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

Lastly, he triples the amount he had left after spending the $8, resulting in $13 * 3 = $39.

Therefore, the eldest boy currently has $39.

"To determine the daily savings amount for Elvis in the second half of April, we must first establish the total number of days in the first and second halves of the month. Since April has 30 days, we can divide this number by 2 to find the number of days in each half, which is 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings amount in the first half as 'x'. According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Therefore, the daily savings amount in the second half will be 2x.

The total savings in the first half will be 15x, and the total savings in the second half will be 15(2x) = 30x.

The total monthly savings target is $1125. We can set up the equation: 15x + 30x = 1125.

Combining like terms, we get 45x = 1125.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 45: x = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since the daily savings amount in the second half is 2x, we can calculate this as 2(25) = 50.

Therefore, Elvis must save $50 per day in the second half of April to meet his monthly savings target.

The final answer is: $50"

"To determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we must first calculate their individual totals based on the number of tasks completed and their respective earnings per task.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, and he completed 20 tasks. Therefore, his total earnings are $0.8 * 20 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, and she also completed 20 tasks. Consequently, her total earnings are $0.5 * 20 = $10.

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus' total: $16 - $10 = $6.

Therefore, Jairus will receive $6 more than Jenny.

The final answer is: $6"
"In the context of a division of assets, specifically a 100-dollar sum between two individuals, Jeff and Brad, we must consider the ratio of their respective allocations. The problem states that Jeff receives 4 times the amount allocated to Brad.

To determine the amount allocated to Jeff, we must first establish the variable representing the amount allocated to Brad. Let's denote this as 'x'. Consequently, the amount allocated to Jeff would be 4x, as per the given ratio.

The total sum of the allocation is 100 dollars. Therefore, the equation representing this scenario is x + 4x = 100.

Simplifying the equation, we combine like terms to obtain 5x = 100.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5, yielding x = 20.

Given that Jeff receives 4 times the amount allocated to Brad, we calculate Jeff's allocation as 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

Therefore, the amount allocated to Jeff is $80.

"To determine the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls in a phone tree, we must analyze the pattern of notification. 

In the first round, the initial contact, Ali, notifies 3 families. 
In the second round, each of the 3 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 families being notified. 
In the third round, each of the 9 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 families being notified. 
In the fourth round, each of the 27 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 families being notified.

Therefore, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

The final answer is: 81"
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we must first calculate the total weight he lost during his illness. Since he lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, the total weight lost is the product of these two values.

The total weight lost is calculated as follows:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we can determine Mark's initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight. This is a straightforward mathematical calculation.

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently possesses, we must first establish the total number of toys in the larger play set. Given that James's play set contains 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can calculate the total number of toys in the larger set by multiplying 80 by 5.

80 * 5 = 400

With this information, we can now establish that Jonathan requires 2 additional toys to possess the same number of toys as the larger play set. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as ""x"". We can then set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently possesses 398 toys.

The final answer is: 398"
"To determine the total cost of the items Daniel wishes to purchase, we must first calculate the cost of each item individually.

The cost of five notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50. 
The cost of two pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
The cost of one calculator at $12 each is 1 * $12 = $12. 
The cost of one geometry set at $10 each is 1 * $10 = $10.

The total cost of the items before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Next, we must apply the 10% discount to the total cost. 
10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

"To determine the amount of change Carly receives, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased. 

Five hamburgers at $4 each amount to 5 x $4 = $20. 
Ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each amount to 10 x $0.30 = $3.
Five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each amount to 5 x $2 = $10.

The total cost of the items is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17.

Therefore, Carly receives $17 in change.

The final answer is: $17"
"To determine the amount of money Antonella earned, we must first calculate the commission for the initial $1000 in sales and then the additional commission for the sales exceeding $1000.

The commission for the initial $1000 is 30% of $1000, which is calculated as 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

Next, we calculate the commission for the sales exceeding $1000. This is $2500 - $1000 = $1500. The additional commission for these sales is 10% of $1500, which is 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

To find the total commission, we add the commission for the initial $1000 and the additional commission for the sales exceeding $1000: $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to purchase for his party, we must first calculate the total number of bottles required. 

Bill has 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. Therefore, he has a total of 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

For his 70 guests, he intends to provide 2 bottles of water each, resulting in a total of 70 x 2 = 140 bottles needed for the guests.

In total, Bill requires 140 (for guests) + 48 (he already has) = 188 bottles.

To find the number of additional bottles he needs to purchase, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles required: 188 - 48 = 140.

Therefore, Bill must acquire 140 additional water bottles for his party.

The final answer is: 140"
"To determine the difference in time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day versus a cold day, we must first establish the time it takes him to swim a mile in each condition.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water.

To calculate the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water, we multiply the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water by 2 and then add 2 minutes. This results in 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions. 

In cold water, it takes him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes to swim 3 miles.
In warm water, it takes him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes to swim 3 miles.

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes him to swim 3 miles in cold water from the time it takes him to swim 3 miles in warm water: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

Therefore, the correct answer is 54 minutes."
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we must first calculate his weekly earnings. John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, resulting in a daily income of $10. Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are $40.

To find the number of weeks required to save $80, we divide the target savings by his weekly earnings:
$80 ÷ $40/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

The final answer is: 2"
"To determine the total cost of lunch at Subway, we must first calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Since it is three times as expensive as the foot-long fish sub, we can calculate this by multiplying the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

Cost of the foot-long fish sub: $40
Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub: $40 * 3 = $120

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of both subs together.

Total cost for both subs: $40 + $120 = $160

Therefore, the total cost for lunch at Subway is $160.

"To determine the amount by which Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we must first establish the current amount he consumes. 

Given that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake as follows:

Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. 
Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.
Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

We are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. 
So, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"In this scenario, we are presented with a straightforward mathematical problem involving the counting of rodents in a pet shop. To determine the total number of rodents, we must first calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately.

The pet shop has 3 cages of hamsters, each containing 10 hamsters. Therefore, the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

Similarly, the pet shop has 3 cages of guinea pigs, each containing 5 guinea pigs. Consequently, the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of rodents, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together: 30 + 15 = 45.

Therefore, the total number of rodents in the pet shop is 45.

"To determine the average weight of the three friends, we must first calculate their individual weights and then find the total weight. 

Mark's weight is 150 pounds. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, which is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Bob's weight is twice Susan's weight, which is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

The total weight of the three friends is the sum of their individual weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of individuals, which is 3. Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a trigonometric problem involving the movement of the sun relative to the great pyramids. The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees, and the sun is moving at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

To determine the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we must calculate the total angle moved by the sun during this period. This can be done by multiplying the rate of movement (5 degrees per hour) by the duration of the movement (10 hours).

Angle moved by the sun = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Now, we add the initial angle of the pyramid (32 degrees) to the angle moved by the sun (50 degrees) to find the final angle from the ground to the sun.

Final angle from the ground to the sun = 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To determine the total amount James spends on birthday candles, we must first calculate the total number of candles required. Since James has two sons, one 12 years old and the other 4 years younger, the younger son is 8 years old.

Given that each child typically requires one candle per year of age, the total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20.

Next, we need to determine the number of packs of candles James must purchase. Each pack contains 5 candles and costs $3. To find the number of packs required, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

The total cost of the candles is then calculated by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on birthday candles.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we must first calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week. 

Judy read for 15 minutes each night in the first week, which equates to a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes. Given her reading speed of 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the total pages read in the first week by determining the number of 1.5 minute intervals in 105 minutes. This is achieved by dividing 105 by 1.5, resulting in 70 intervals.

Consequently, Judy can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes. 

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Therefore, in two weeks, Judy read a total of 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"In the context of this scenario, we have two individuals, Cody and Trevor, who initially possessed 12 sandwiches. Cody consumed a third of the sandwiches, which equates to 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches. 

Trevor, on the other hand, consumed a quarter of the sandwiches, which is equivalent to 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

To determine the remaining number of sandwiches, we must calculate the total number of sandwiches consumed by both individuals, which is 4 (Cody) + 3 (Trevor) = 7 sandwiches.

Consequently, the number of sandwiches left is 12 (initial sandwiches) - 7 (sandwiches consumed) = 5 sandwiches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the age of Shiloh's nephew, we must first establish the relationship between their ages. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 

At that time, his nephew's age will be denoted as x + 7, where x represents the nephew's current age.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as the equation 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7. This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x. This simplifies to x = 10.

Therefore, the current age of Shiloh's nephew is 10 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we must analyze the compensation structure for each tooth lost.

The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth. 

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, resulting in a total of $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. Therefore, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

To find the total amount, we add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we must first establish the individual goal counts for each player.

We are informed that Richie scored 80 goals. Furthermore, it is stated that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, Mark's goal count can be calculated by subtracting 20 from Richie's total: 80 - 20 = 60 goals.

Additionally, we are told that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Consequently, Anna's goal count can be determined by subtracting 45 from Richie's total: 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Now, to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we must sum their individual goal counts: 80 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 175.

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers is 175.

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"

The total cost of the vaccinations is calculated by multiplying the number of vaccinations by the cost per vaccination: 3 * $20 = $60.

The total cost of the broken vases is determined by multiplying the number of vases by the cost per vase: 4 * $12 = $48.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccinations, and the cost of the broken vases: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

Therefore, the total cost associated with the kitten is $308."
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we must first calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. Therefore, the total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

Therefore, the correct answer is 100 roses.

**The final answer is: 100**"

There are 24 months in 2 years, as each year consists of 12 months. The monthly withdrawal is $100. 

The total amount withdrawn is calculated as follows: 24 months * $100/month = $2400.

The initial balance in the account is $3000. 

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial balance: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

Therefore, the remaining balance in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To determine the net profit of the food truck, we must first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf yields 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

Total cost = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each, resulting in a total revenue of $70.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

Therefore, the net profit of the food truck is $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"

"To determine the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom, we must consider the costs associated with the materials and labor involved in the process.

First, we calculate the area of the bedroom, which is 18 feet by 12 feet. The area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of the materials is $2592 + $432 + $864 = $3888.

The total cost of the labor is $864 + $7344 = $8208.

"To determine the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we must first calculate the total number of birds observed over the week. This can be achieved by summing the number of birds seen on each day.

On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds. On day three, he saw none. On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. On day six, he saw 20 birds, and on day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Total birds seen = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
Total birds seen = 280

Next, we must calculate the average by dividing the total number of birds seen by the number of days.

Number of days = 7

Average birds per day = Total birds seen / Number of days
Average birds per day = 280 / 7
Average birds per day = 40

Therefore, the average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40.

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we must first establish the discrepancy between the set and actual temperatures. The set temperature is 450 degrees, while the actual temperature is 468 degrees. 

The difference between the set and actual temperatures is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we divide this difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100.

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. To do this, we must calculate 4% of 520 and subtract it from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8

However, since Maggie cannot set the oven to a fraction of a degree, we will round to the nearest whole number. 

The temperature she should set the oven to is 520 - 20.8 = 499.2

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature she should set the oven to is 499.

The final answer is: 499"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we must first convert the duration of each film into minutes. The first movie, lasting 1 hour and 30 minutes, is equivalent to 60 minutes (1 hour) plus 30 minutes, totaling 90 minutes. 

The second movie, lasting 2 hours and 5 minutes, is equivalent to 120 minutes (2 hours) plus 5 minutes, totaling 125 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the duration of both movies together: 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes.

"To determine the value of Juan's house, we must first calculate the amount by which it is less expensive than Herb's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive, we can find this amount by multiplying Herb's house price by 0.3.

Herb's house price is $76,000. 
30% of Herb's house price = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800

Now, we subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price.
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

To find the combined value of the two houses, we add Herb's house price and Juan's house price together.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To determine the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend to the charity event, we must first establish the quantities of cups and dishes each brought.

Judy purchased a dozen cups, which equates to 12 cups. Additionally, she acquired twice as many dishes as cups, resulting in 24 dishes.

Her friend, on the other hand, brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, which translates to 44 dishes.

To calculate the total number of cups Judy brought, we add her cups and dishes: 12 (cups) + 24 (dishes) = 36.

Similarly, to calculate the total number of cups her friend brought, we add her cups and dishes: 40 (cups) + 44 (dishes) = 84.

Now, to determine the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend, we add their respective totals: 36 (Judy's total) + 84 (friend's total) = 120.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend is 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost per pair of contacts, we must first establish the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have. Given that 90 single-use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can calculate the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day as follows:

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete purchases 2 boxes, he will have a total of:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

The total number of days the contacts will last is:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

However, this calculation is unnecessary for determining the cost per pair of contacts. We can directly calculate the cost per pair by dividing the total cost of the contacts by the total number of pairs.

The cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is:
2 boxes * $100/box = $200
10% discount = $200 * 0.10 = $20
$200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we must first calculate their individual earnings based on their respective hours worked and the agreed-upon hourly wage of $10.

Jill worked a total of 3 hours, consisting of 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. Her total earnings can be calculated as follows: 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John's hours worked are calculated by doubling Jill's Saturday hours (2 hours) and tripling Jill's Sunday hours (1 hour). This results in John working a total of 4 hours on Saturday and 3 hours on Sunday, for a total of 7 hours. His total earnings are therefore 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

Therefore, the difference in earnings between John and Jill is $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories burned during her activities. 

Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour. 

The total calories burned from aerobics is 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories. The total calories burned from running is 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories. 

The total calories burned is the sum of the calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we must determine the number of 200-calorie units. This is calculated by dividing the total calories burned by 200, which is 1600 / 200 = 8.

To find the total amount of water needed, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 ml, which is 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

Therefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 800 ml.

"In the case of Burger Palace v. Jelly Bean Jar, we are presented with a scenario where a jar contains red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar states that it contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500.

To determine the number of green jelly beans in excess of red jelly beans, we must first establish the relationship between the three types of jelly beans. Let B represent the number of blue jelly beans, R represent the number of red jelly beans, and G represent the number of green jelly beans.

Given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, we can express this as an equation: B + R + G = 4500.

Furthermore, we know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3.01B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3.01:
B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the average typing speed of Jared, we must first calculate the total sum of his three measurements and then divide by the number of measurements.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM). His second typing speed is 52 WPM. To find his third typing speed, we add 5 words per minute to his second speed, resulting in 57 WPM.

Now, let's calculate the total sum of his typing speeds: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of measurements, which is 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

Therefore, the average typing speed of Jared is 52 WPM.

The final answer is: 52"
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we must first calculate the weight change for each scenario over a period of five weeks.

In the first scenario, where Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over a period of five weeks, this equates to a total weight loss of 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds.

In the second scenario, where Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over a period of five weeks, this equates to a total weight gain of 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two scenarios is calculated by subtracting the weight gained from the weight lost: 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds.

Therefore, the difference in weight at the end of five weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we must consider the chain of invitations and the additional guests brought by her friends.

First, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these individuals will also invite 2 friends, resulting in a total of 100 + (100 * 2) = 300 additional guests.

Next, Alex extends invitations to 10 of her friends, and 8 of them indicate they will be bringing their spouses. This adds 18 more individuals to the total count.

Combining these groups, we have a total of 300 (from the email invitations) + 18 (from Alex's friends) = 318 people. However, this count does not account for Alex herself, so we must add 1 to the total.

Therefore, the total number of seats Alex will need is 318 + 1 = 319.

The final answer is: 319"
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we must first establish the weight of the Papillon. The Dachshund's weight is directly related to the Affenpinscher's weight, as it is stated that the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. Given that the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds, the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Next, we must calculate the Papillon's weight, which is one-fourth of the Dachshund's weight. Therefore, the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Finally, we can determine the Mastiff's weight by multiplying the Papillon's weight by 44. This yields a weight of 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To determine the difference in cost between purchasing the boots on Amazon and eBay, we must first calculate the total cost of each purchase.

The boots on Amazon cost $16, with an additional shipping cost of $4. Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

On the other hand, the boots on eBay cost $13, with a shipping cost that is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. Thus, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to consider the exponential growth of the beanstalk's height. Given that it starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day, we can calculate the height of the beanstalk for each day.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Based on this calculation, it is evident that the beanstalk will exceed 20 feet in height on the fourth day.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 4 days"
"To determine the amount of protein John receives from consuming mushrooms, we must first establish the protein content per unit of weight. Given that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein percentage as follows: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John consumes 200 grams of mushrooms daily. To calculate the daily protein intake, we multiply the weight of mushrooms consumed by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

Therefore, the weekly protein intake from mushrooms for John is 42 grams.

The final answer is: 42"
"To determine Jerry's age in 3 years, we must first establish his current age. The statement that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago can be expressed as an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Where 'x' represents Jerry's current age.

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

Therefore, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine the number of hours George must work to pay for the dental work, we must first calculate the total amount he needs to pay. The base price of each implant is $2000, and since he requires two implants, the total base price is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

However, he also wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which adds an additional $500 to the total cost. Therefore, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To calculate the number of hours he must work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage of $15: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

Therefore, George must work 260 hours to pay for the dental work.

The final answer is: 260"
"In the realm of geometry, specifically within the context of triangles, it is a fundamental principle that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle equates to 180 degrees. 

Given the stipulation that one angle is twice the smallest angle and another is three times the smallest angle, we can establish an equation to solve for the measure of the smallest angle. 

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Consequently, the other two angles would be 2x and 3x, respectively.

The equation representing the sum of the three angles is x + 2x + 3x = 180.

By combining like terms, we arrive at 6x = 180.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 6 yields x = 30.

With the smallest angle now known to be 30 degrees, we can determine the measures of the other two angles. One angle is 2x, which equals 2(30) = 60 degrees. The other angle is 3x, which equals 3(30) = 90 degrees.

Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can purchase, we must first calculate the total amount of money he possesses in cents. 

8 quarters equate to 8 x 25 cents, totaling 200 cents. 
6 dimes equate to 6 x 10 cents, totaling 60 cents. 
14 nickels equate to 14 x 5 cents, totaling 70 cents. 
15 pennies equate to 15 x 1 cent, totaling 15 cents.

The cumulative total of Colby's funds is 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

To ascertain the number of gumballs Colby can purchase, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball, which is 5 cents.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

Therefore, Colby can purchase 69 gumballs.

"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we must first calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then sum those values.

Dogs, being quadruped mammals, possess four legs each. With 5 dogs in the store, the total number of dog legs is 5 x 4 = 20.

Cats, being quadruped mammals as well, also possess four legs each. With 2 cats in the store, the total number of cat legs is 2 x 4 = 8.

Birds, being bipedal, possess two legs each. With 10 birds in the store, the total number of bird legs is 10 x 2 = 20.

Now, we sum the total number of legs: 20 (dog legs) + 8 (cat legs) + 20 (bird legs) = 48.

Therefore, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"To determine the weight Jamaal now uses, we must first calculate the weight after increasing the initial 8-pound weight by 50%. This involves finding 50% of 8 pounds and adding it to the original weight.

50% of 8 pounds is calculated as 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to the original 8 pounds results in 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, Jamaal then uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than this. Therefore, we must subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

Therefore, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we must consider the games he receives as gifts and the games he purchases himself.

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday gifts and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. Additionally, he purchases 1 game per month for 12 months, resulting in 12 games. Therefore, in the first year, Steve acquires a total of 10 + 12 = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He purchases 2 games per month for 12 months, resulting in 24 games. Consequently, in the second year, Steve acquires a total of 5 + 24 = 29 games.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He purchases 4 games per month for 12 months, resulting in 48 games. Therefore, in the third year, Steve acquires a total of 5 + 48 = 53 games.

"To determine the time it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we must first establish the plane's speed. This can be calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

Distance traveled: 1200 miles
Time taken: 3 hours

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in a 12-hour workday, we must first establish their individual hourly production rates.

Ruiz's production rate can be calculated by dividing the total pounds of chocolates he produces in two hours by the number of hours worked. In this case, Ruiz produces 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, which equates to 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa's production rate is 3/4 times Ruiz's hourly production rate. Since Ruiz produces 60 pounds of chocolates per hour, Marissa produces (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds of chocolates per hour.

To calculate the total amount of chocolates produced by both Ruiz and Marissa in a 12-hour workday, we multiply their individual hourly production rates by the number of hours worked and then sum the results. Ruiz produces 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he produces 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates. Marissa produces 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she produces 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

The combined total of chocolates produced by Ruiz and Marissa in a 12-hour workday is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"To determine the amount of money Howard has left, we must first calculate the total amount he spent at the arcade. 

On Monday, Howard spent $8. 
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount:
$100 - $88 = $12.

Therefore, the correct answer is $12."
"To determine the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we must first calculate the total number of cups sold and the total amount earned from each period, then add them together.

For the initial four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup. 
Total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total amount earned in 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

For the subsequent two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total amount earned in 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Total amount earned in 6 hours = $30 + $12 = $42

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the lifespan of the tires, we must first calculate the total number of rotations they can endure per month. Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles per month, we can calculate the monthly rotations as follows:

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Next, we need to find out how many months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. We know that each tire can undergo a total of 10,440,000 rotations.

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 290,000
Months before replacement = 36

To find the number of years, we divide the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 36 / 12
Years before replacement = 3

Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced in 3 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the cost per pump of the shampoo, we must first calculate the total number of pumps in the bottle. The directions indicate that 2 pumps yield 120 washings. Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

Therefore, the cost per pump of the shampoo is 10 cents.

"To determine the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to consider the total cost of the items and the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items. The shirt has a price of $25, and there is a 30% discount. The discount on the shirt is 30% of $25, which is 0.3 * $25 = $7.5. Therefore, the discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.5 = $17.5.

Next, we add the price of the shorts, which is $35, to the discounted price of the shirt to get the total cost: $17.5 + $35 = $52.5.

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we do not need to calculate it separately. Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Joe has: $50 - $52.5 = -$2.5.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: $-2.5"
"To determine the amount of butter required to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we must first calculate the total number of croissants to be produced. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of croissants is 4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen.

Converting this to individual croissants, we multiply the total number of dozens by 12 croissants/dozen: 28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants.

Next, we calculate the amount of butter required per dozen croissants, which is 1/4 pound. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen: 336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds.

Therefore, the total amount of butter required to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week is 84 pounds.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the additional cost of repaving Lewis' street, we must first establish the cost of repaving a street of a given length. The cost per meter is $194.

Next, we must calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street, which is 150 meters long. The cost is 194 * 150 = $29,100.

To find the additional cost of repaving Lewis' street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.

Therefore, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street is $65,960."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we must first establish the funding for the initial 5 months and the subsequent 45 months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months, the funding increases by 50% of the initial funding. 
50% of $100,000 is $50,000, so the increased funding is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

The total cost for the remaining 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months:
$100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

"To determine the difference in expenditures between the two sports coaches, we must first calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach purchased 9 baseballs at $3 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 9 x $3 = $27.

The basketball coach, on the other hand, acquired 8 basketballs at $14 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 8 x $14 = $112.

To find the difference in their expenditures, we subtract the baseball coach's total from the basketball coach's total: $112 - $27 = $85.

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To determine the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden, we must first calculate the total number of flowers present. Given that there are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Next, we need to calculate the fraction of flowers that have bloomed, which is 4/5. To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by this fraction: 4/5 * 200.

To perform this calculation, we multiply the numerator (4) by the total number of flowers (200) and then divide by the denominator (5): (4 * 200) / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160.

Therefore, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we must first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s. 

1 Mb is equivalent to 1000 kb. Therefore, to convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s, we divide 20 by 1000:
20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Next, we need to convert her speed from Mb/s to Mb/hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find the speed in Mb/hour, we multiply 0.02 Mb/s by 3600 s/h:
0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h."
"To determine the total number of cars towed by the truck, we must first calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days of the week.

The number of cars towed on the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30.

The remaining days of the week are 7 - 3 = 4 days. Since the truck towed 4 fewer cars on each of these days, the number of cars towed on each of these days is 10 - 4 = 6. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 6 * 4 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we must first establish the height requirement and Adam's current height in the same unit of measurement. Since the height requirement is given in feet, we will convert Adam's height from inches to feet.

The height requirement is 4 feet, which is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 inches. Adam's current height is 40 inches.

To find the difference in height, we subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can calculate the number of years it will take for him to reach the required height by dividing the difference in height by his growth rate: 8 / 2 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the required height and ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine James' earnings from selling the used cars, we must first calculate the profit from the sale. The total cost of the cars is $250,000, which is the sum of the purchase price of 10 cars at $25,000 each.

The company's cost to acquire the cars is 30% of the total purchase price, which is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000. Therefore, the profit from selling the cars is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

As the salesperson, James earns a 10% commission on the profit. His commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we must first calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate this as follows:

100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate this as follows:

25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we can determine the number of men who can stay upright by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total price for all three jewels, we must first establish the prices of each. The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. Given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold Jewell as follows:

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * Price of diamond Jewell
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Next, we are informed that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver Jewell as follows:

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we must first establish the quantities of each type of stamp. 

Max purchased 16 snowflake stamps. The number of truck stamps is 3 more than the snowflake stamps, which equates to 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. 

The number of rose stamps is 9 fewer than the truck stamps, resulting in 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To calculate the total number of stamps, we add the quantities of each type: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

Therefore, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"In the context of a motor vehicle pursuit, the time it takes for one vehicle to catch up to another is a critical factor in determining the likelihood of apprehension. To calculate this time, we must first determine the relative speed between the two vehicles.

In this scenario, Bob is traveling at a speed of 55 miles per hour, while Tom is traveling at a speed of 70 miles per hour. The relative speed is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.

The distance between the two vehicles is 75 miles. To calculate the time it will take for Tom to catch up to Bob, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed

Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up to Bob.

**Answer:** 5 hours"
"To determine the number of fish Tommy caught, we must first establish the number of fish Darren caught. Since Darren's catch is 6 less than Naomi's, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's total.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Therefore, we can calculate Tommy's catch by adding 3 to Darren's total.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

Therefore, the correct answer is 14."
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to consider the total cost of the classes and the cost per class limit set by his parents.

The total cost of the classes is $60, and the cost per class limit is $10. Since there are 10 classes in total, we can calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can attend at the $10 per class limit.

Cost per class = Total cost of classes / Number of classes
Cost per class = $60 / 10
Cost per class = $6

However, Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class. To find the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit, we need to find the point at which the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's assume Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and y classes at $10 per class. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

6x + 10y = 60

Since Manny can't attend a fraction of a class, we need to find the maximum whole number of classes he can attend at $6 per class.

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we must first establish their individual daily production rates. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. As a result, her weekly production is calculated by multiplying her daily rate by the number of days in a week, which is 7. Therefore, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, meaning her daily production rate is twice that of Jewel's. Consequently, Julie's daily production is 50 * 2 = 100 customers. To find her weekly production, we multiply her daily rate by 7, yielding 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The combined weekly production of Julie and Jewel is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To determine the distance Lynn ran, we must first establish the distance Reggie ran. Since Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles, Reggie's distance is 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

Given that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, we can calculate Lynn's distance by subtracting 3 miles from Reggie's distance: 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To determine the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we must first calculate the cost of each item separately.

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20. To find the cost of 5 apples, we must calculate the cost per apple and then multiply it by 5. The cost per apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. Therefore, the cost of 5 apples is $1.30 * 5 = $6.50.

Similarly, the cost of 3 oranges is $3.30. To find the cost of 5 oranges, we must calculate the cost per orange and then multiply it by 5. The cost per orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10. Therefore, the cost of 5 oranges is $1.10 * 5 = $5.50.

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost. The total cost is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

Therefore, the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges is $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we must first calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole, is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

Given the dimensions of the hole are 6 feet in length, 4 feet in width, and 3 feet in depth, we can calculate the volume as follows:

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. To find the total time it will take him to dig the hole, we multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: 216"
"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we must first calculate the cost of each added feature and then add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To determine the total amount Tim will make in a year, we must first calculate his new monthly salary after the 5% raise. The raise is calculated as 5% of his original $20,000 monthly salary.

5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, we calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary:
Bonus = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, we calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, we calculate the total annual income:
Total annual income = Total monthly income * 12 = $31,000 * 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To determine the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we must calculate the cost of each item and add them up.

First, we calculate the cost of the suits: 10 suits at $750 each amounts to a total of $7500.

Next, we calculate the cost of the dress pants. Since the dress pants cost 1/5 the cost of a suit, we multiply the cost of a suit by 1/5, which is $750 * 1/5 = $150. Therefore, 10 dress pants at $150 each amount to a total of $1500.

Now, we calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and since he bought 10 suits, he bought a total of 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we add up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"
"To determine the total number of articles published by the news website and its sister company in February, we must first calculate the total number of articles published by each entity. 

The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day. Given that February has 28 days, the total number of articles published by the news website is calculated as follows:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day. With 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

To find the combined total, we add the number of articles published by the news website and the sister company:
560 articles (news website) + 280 articles (sister company) = 840 articles

Therefore, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we must first establish the ages of the individuals involved. 

Steve's wife is 4 years older than Steve, who is 60 years old. Therefore, Steve's wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Their son's age can be calculated by determining half of his mother's age, which is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Given that Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, her age is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

Therefore, the age of Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we must first calculate the total amount of flour in one bag. Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can find the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

The calculation is as follows: 8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms.

Now, to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3: 16 kilograms * 3 = 48 kilograms.

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo. Three weeks later, the number of likes increased to 70 times the initial number of likes. This means the number of likes after three weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140,000.

However, we are informed that Fishio received 20,000 additional likes recently. To find the current total number of likes, we must add these new likes to the number of likes after three weeks.

Therefore, the current total number of likes is 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"To determine the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we must first calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day.

On the first day, Clara purchased 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she received a $2 discount due to a voucher. The total cost is therefore 20 * $20 - $2 = $398.

On the second day, the price of the pomegranates increased to $30 per fruit, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is 20 * $30 = $600. The discount is 10% of $600, which is $600 * 0.1 = $60. Therefore, the total cost with the discount is $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

"To determine the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we must first establish the sales figures for each month.

In the first month, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. This implies that the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800, as $400 is half of $800.

Consequently, the total sales in the first month were $800 (green hats) + $400 (red hats) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales in the second month were 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we must first establish the expected total amount in her bank account if she had received her full wage. 

Her weekly wage is $300, and her account initially held $200. Therefore, the expected total amount in her account would be the sum of her initial balance and her full wage.

Expected wage: $300
Initial amount in the account: $200
Expected total: $300 + $200 = $500

However, the actual amount in her account is $420. To find the amount withheld, we must calculate the difference between the expected total and the actual amount.

Actual amount: $420
Expected total: $500
Withheld amount: $500 - $420 = $80

Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally's wage is $80."
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs for her party, we must first calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Given that each guest will consume 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, we can calculate the total number of deviled egg halves as follows:

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since each whole egg yields 2 deviled egg halves, we can calculate the total number of eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

Number of deviled egg halves needed: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To determine the number of dozens of eggs required, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen.

"In the context of a contractual obligation, such as a homework assignment, the completion deadline is a critical factor. In this scenario, Mike's teacher has assigned a 200-page book to be read within a 30-day timeframe. 

To determine the number of days Mike will require to complete the reading, we must consider his reading pace. Mike plans to read 10 pages per day. 

By dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages read per day, we can calculate the number of days required to complete the assignment.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Given that Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can now calculate the number of days before the deadline that he will finish reading the book.

Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish the book
= 30 - 20

"To determine the cost difference between two mixtures of nuts, we must first calculate the total cost of each mixture. 

For the first mixture, consisting of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we calculate the cost as follows:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is 1/2 * $10 = $5.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is 1/3 * $15 = $5.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture, consisting of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we calculate the cost as follows:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is 1/5 * $10 = $2.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is 1/3 * $15 = $5.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

$10 - $7 = $3.

Therefore, the correct answer is $3."
"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we must consider the total number of animal legs and heads. 

Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4S + 2G = 70.

Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, the total number of heads can be represented as S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchase, we must first calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

20% of $5 is calculated as 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
Therefore, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he requires 7 pounds of coffee for a week. 
The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

In addition to the coffee, Roger also purchases a donut for $2.

The total cost of Roger's purchase is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

Therefore, the total cost of Roger's purchase is $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we must first calculate the total amount spent on the other items. 

Gus purchased 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each, which totals to 2 x $2.00 = $4.00. 
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken, which is $8.00, we get $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00.
Lastly, we add the cost of the bottle of soda, which is $1.00, resulting in a total of $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, we subtract the total cost of the items from the $20.00 Gus spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we must first establish the total number of newspapers delivered to Districts A and C, and then subtract that figure from the overall total.

The total number of newspapers delivered is 600. District A received 198 newspapers, and District C received 209.

To find the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we must calculate the sum of newspapers delivered to Districts A and C, and then subtract that sum from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Newspapers delivered to District A and District C = 198 + 209 = 407

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - Newspapers delivered to District A and District C
= 600 - 407
= 193

Therefore, the number of newspapers delivered to District B is 193.

The final answer is: 193"
"To determine the number of recipes John learns in the cooking class, we must first calculate the total class time. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, resulting in a weekly class time of 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class spans 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

Next, we need to calculate the number of recipes John learns. He acquires a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find the total number of recipes, we divide the total class time by the time required to learn a new recipe: 48 / 1.5 = 32.

Therefore, John learns 32 new recipes in the cooking class.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the collective sleeping time of the math teachers, we must first establish the number of math teachers on the school basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can calculate the number of history teachers as follows:

Number of history teachers = 60% of 150
= 0.6 * 150
= 90

Consequently, the number of math teachers is the difference between the total number of teachers and the number of history teachers:

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60

Now, we can calculate the collective sleeping time of the math teachers by multiplying the number of math teachers by the hours they sleep per day:

Total time = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
= 60 * 6
= 360

Therefore, the math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day.

The final answer is: 360"
"In this scenario, we are presented with a financial dispute between three individuals: Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna. To determine the equitable distribution of their combined funds, we must first establish the amount of money each individual possesses.

Aurelia's financial situation is clear, as she has $120. However, the financial circumstances of Kassidy and Rayna require further examination. It is established that Kassidy's financial holdings are 3/4 of Aurelia's, which equates to (3/4) * 120 = $90.

Furthermore, it is stipulated that Rayna possesses $60 more than Kassidy. Consequently, Rayna's financial holdings amount to $90 + $60 = $150.

To resolve the dispute, we must calculate the total amount of money held by the three individuals and then divide it equally among them. The combined total is $120 (Aurelia) + $90 (Kassidy) + $150 (Rayna) = $360.

To determine the equitable distribution, we divide the total amount by 3, resulting in $360 / 3 = $120.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

$120"
"In the context of a basketball game, the duration of the game is typically calculated by adding the length of the regular quarters to any additional time added due to a tie. In this case, the game consists of four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes. 

The total length of the regular quarters is calculated as follows: 4 quarters * 12 minutes per quarter = 48 minutes.

However, the game was extended by an additional 5 minutes due to a tie in the last quarter. To determine the total duration of the game, we must add this additional time to the total length of the regular quarters.

Therefore, the total duration of the game is 48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes.

The final answer is: 53"
"To determine the number of employees who oversee the company, we must first identify the total number of management personnel. Given that 20% of the 50 employees are management, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Next, we need to find the number of management personnel who oversee the entire company. Since only 30% of the management personnel are in this position, we can calculate this as follows:

30% of 10 = 0.3 * 10 = 3

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients required for 16 muffins, we must first calculate the individual amounts of flour, sugar, and salt needed.

For 16 muffins, the amount of flour required is 16 * 5 = 80 tablespoons.
The amount of sugar needed is 16 * 3 = 48 tablespoons.
The amount of salt needed is 16 * 0.25 = 4 tablespoons.

Now, we add the amounts of flour, sugar, and salt together to get the total amount of dry ingredients needed: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

Therefore, the total amount of dry ingredients required for 16 muffins is 132 tablespoons.

"In the context of a hypothetical scenario where Robert, Cindy, and Aaron decide to pool their candy and share it equally among themselves, we must first determine the total amount of candy at their disposal.

The total amount of candy is calculated by adding the individual quantities possessed by each party: Robert's 3 pounds, Cindy's 5 pounds, and Aaron's 4 pounds.

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4
Total candy = 12 pounds

To determine the equitable distribution of the candy, we must divide the total amount by the number of individuals involved in the sharing arrangement, which in this case is 3.

12 / 3 = 4

Therefore, each of the parties would be entitled to 4 pounds of candy after the sharing arrangement."
"In the context of a transaction, the amount of change received by a customer is determined by subtracting the total cost of the items purchased from the amount paid. 

To calculate the total cost of the candies, we must first determine the cost of each type of candy. Type A candies cost $0.5 each, and type B candies cost $0.75 each.

The cost of 7 type A candies is 7 * $0.5 = $3.5.
The cost of 10 type B candies is 10 * $0.75 = $7.5.

The total cost of the candies is $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.

Since Adam paid $15, the change he received is $15 - $11 = $4.

Therefore, the correct answer is: $4"
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we must first establish the total number of good days Christina recorded. It is stated that she had twelve good days over the past thirty days of moods.

Breaking down the given information, we know that the first eight days were good, the second eight days were bad, and the third eight days were neutral. This accounts for 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 days.

Since Christina recorded her moods over thirty days, the remaining days are 30 - 24 = 6. However, we are informed that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. This means that two of the remaining days were good.

Therefore, considering the total number of good days, we subtract the good days already accounted for (8) from the total number of good days (12), which leaves us with 12 - 8 = 4 good days. However, we must also account for the two good days in the last three days. Thus, the number of good days left in the month is 4 + 2 = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"In the context of this problem, we are dealing with a mathematical equation to determine the number of books Sally possesses. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the given information, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are informed that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation yields:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches, we must first establish the current height in inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the initial height of 20 feet to inches as follows:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Next, we calculate the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we can determine the number of days required for the bamboo to reach the target height by dividing the difference by the daily growth rate of 30 inches:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we must consider the sequence of events and the changing number of dogs in the shelter.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This implies that each dog has one toy. When 8 more dogs are added to the shelter, James needs 8 additional toys to ensure each dog has a toy. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12.

However, upon James' return, the number of dogs in the shelter doubles, increasing to 28. Consequently, James must acquire 28 more toys to meet the needs of the additional dogs. This brings the total number of toys needed to 40.

Finally, when 3 dogs are removed from the shelter, James no longer requires 3 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 40 - 3 = 37.

The final answer is: 37"
"To determine the amount invested by Skyler, we must first calculate the remaining amount after Dylan and Frances made their respective investments.

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is $1200. To find this amount, we multiply 2/5 by 1200.

(2/5) * 1200 = 480

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is $1200 - $480 = $720.

Next, we calculate Frances' investment, which is 2/3 of the remaining amount.

(2/3) * 720 = 480

The remaining amount after Frances' investment is $720 - $480 = $240.

Therefore, Skyler's investment is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal, we must first calculate the total number of signatures they currently possess. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

The sisters aim to collect a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many signatures they need to collect, we subtract the total signatures they currently have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we can calculate the number of signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal.

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of 100 signatures.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine Karen's earnings in two days, we must first establish her hourly wage. As Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is $20.

Next, we calculate the total hours Karen works in two days. Given that she works 3 hours per day, her total hours worked in two days is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

To find Karen's total earnings, we multiply her hourly wage by the total hours worked: $20 * 6 = $120.

Therefore, Karen's earnings in two days are $120."
"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we must first establish the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can establish a ratio of 6:36. To find the number of hash browns that can be produced from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion.

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Cross-multiplying, we get:

6x = 96 * 36
6x = 3456
x = 576

Therefore, the correct answer is that 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"In the context of elevator safety regulations, it is crucial to adhere to the maximum load capacity to prevent accidents and ensure the well-being of occupants. Given that the elevator in Jack's building supports a maximum load of 700 kg and an adult weighs an average of 80 kg, we can calculate the total weight of 9 adults.

The total weight of 9 adults is calculated as follows: 80 kg (weight of one adult) * 9 (number of adults) = 720 kg.

To determine the extent to which the maximum load is exceeded, we must compare the total weight of the 9 adults to the maximum load capacity of the elevator. The difference between the two values will indicate the amount by which the maximum load is exceeded.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

Therefore, the maximum load of the elevator is exceeded by 20 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of cookies, we must first establish the number of cookies each individual possesses.

Katarina has 68 cookies. 
Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
The Cookie Monster has 12 less cookies than Max, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we add up the number of cookies each person has: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298

Therefore, the total number of cookies is 298."
"To determine the original length of the dress, we must first consider the total added length. The dress was extended by 50% of its original length and then 20cm was added to the bottom. 

Let's denote the original length as 'x'. The extension is 50% of x, which is 0.5x. Adding 20cm to this extension gives us 0.5x + 20.

The final length of the dress is 140cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + (0.5x + 20) = 140.

Combining like terms, we get 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get 1.5x = 120.

Dividing both sides by 1.5, we find that x = 80.

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we must first establish the time it took for each mode of operation. 

The time in turtle mode is 60 minutes, as it takes Chris 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in this mode. The time in rabbit mode is 40 minutes, as Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes using this mode.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we must calculate the time for each mode by multiplying the respective time by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"In this scenario, we are dealing with a temporal constraint, specifically a time limit within which John and Jack must arrive at school. To determine the remaining time available to them, we must first calculate the cumulative time required to reach the fire station.

The time it takes to get to the corner where the library is is 6 minutes, and the time it takes to get to the fire station from that point is 13 minutes. Therefore, the total time required to reach the fire station is 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes.

Given that John and Jack have a total of 30 minutes to reach school, we can now calculate the remaining time available to them by subtracting the time required to reach the fire station from the total time available.

Remaining time = Total time available - Time required to reach the fire station
Remaining time = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Remaining time = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes remaining to reach school without being late.

The final answer is: 11"

"To solve this problem, we must first establish the ages of the twins and the triplet. Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

Given that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we have two key pieces of information: the combined ages of the twins and the triplet are 44, and the older twin is 7 years older than the triplet.

We can express the first piece of information as an equation: T + (T+7) + t = 44. This equation represents the sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet.

The second piece of information can be expressed as an equation as well: T+7 = t+7. However, this equation is redundant, as it simply states that the older twin is 7 years older than the triplet. A more useful relationship can be derived from this information: T = t.

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44. Combining like terms, we get 3t + 7 = 44.

Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation yields 3t = 37. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us t = 12.33.

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, we are asked to find the age of one of the twins. Given that we have two twins, we must determine the age of the older twin.

The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33.

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is 19.33.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"
"To determine the amount of time John has available for a nap, we must first calculate the total time he has before dinner. Since John has 3 hours before dinner, we convert this to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time John spends on his homework. He has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. Adding these together, we get: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap."
"To determine the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we must first establish the cost of each item. 

The cost of 5 lollipops is $2.00, as each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of one lollipop is $0.40. 

To find the cost of one candy, we must subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies, which is $3.20. This results in $1.20 for the 4 candies. 

Dividing the cost of 4 candies by 4 yields the cost of one candy, which is $0.30.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we must first calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To determine the amount John leaves with after visiting the vet, we must first calculate the total cost of the services provided. The cost of the vaccines is $20 per vaccine, and since there are two vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

The total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we must first establish the cost of each individual fruit. 

An apple costs $0.5. Since a banana costs twice as much as an apple, a banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1. 

An orange, being the most expensive, costs three times as much as a banana. Therefore, an orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"In this scenario, we are dealing with a civil matter involving a restaurant's seating capacity. The restaurant has a specific number of high chairs and regular chairs, and we need to determine the number of additional chairs required to accommodate the expected number of attendees.

First, we must calculate the total number of regular chairs available. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of chairs required to accommodate the attendees. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function, so the total number of chairs needed is 42 + 15 = 57.

To determine the number of additional chairs required, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs needed. The total number of chairs available is 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48. Therefore, the number of additional chairs required is 57 - 48 = 9.

Based on this analysis, the restaurant needs to acquire 9 additional chairs to accommodate the expected number of attendees.

"To determine the number of points the class is missing to go on the trip, we must first calculate the total points collected by each student.

Adam has collected 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find this amount, we calculate 30% of 50, which is 0.3 * 50 = 15. Therefore, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Consequently, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. This equates to 3 * 35 = 105 points.

The total points collected by the class is 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

"To determine the amount of money Greta has left to spend after funding her retirement account and making her monthly car payment, we must first calculate the deductions from her paycheck.

Greta's paycheck is $2400.00. She allocates 50% of her pay to her retirement account. This is calculated as 0.5 x $2400.00 = $1200.00.

Next, she uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment, which is 0.2 x $2400.00 = $480.00.

To find the total deductions, we add the retirement account contribution and the car payment: $1200.00 + $480.00 = $1680.00.

Now, we subtract the total deductions from her paycheck: $2400.00 - $1680.00 = $720.00.

Therefore, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

The final answer is: $720.00"
"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we must first establish the total number of pencils present. Given that the box has a capacity for 20 pencils and 4 are missing, we can calculate the remaining pencils by subtracting the missing pencils from the total capacity.

Total capacity of the box = 20 pencils
Pencils missing = 4

Number of pencils in the box = Total capacity of the box - Pencils missing
= 20 - 4
= 16

Next, we must calculate the number of pairs of pencils. Since a pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

Number of pairs of pencils = Number of pencils in the box / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Therefore, the correct answer is 8."
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we must first calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display.

The city display consists of 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. Therefore, the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

However, Hannah can only see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find 40% of 300, we multiply 0.4 by 300, which equals 120.

In addition to the city display, Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. Therefore, the total number of fireworks from her backyard display is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display: 120 + 15 = 135.

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To determine the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we must first calculate the total number of items purchased. Since each seat can accommodate one person, two drinks, and three snacks, we need to calculate the total number of people and then multiply it by the number of drinks and snacks each person's seat can hold.

There are 19 people in total: Aiden and his 12 friends, plus 7 additional friends. 

Now, we calculate the total number of drinks and snacks: 19 people * 2 drinks/person = 38 drinks, and 19 people * 3 snacks/person = 57 snacks. 

The total number of items purchased is 38 drinks + 57 snacks = 95 items.

Given that each item costs $2, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 95 items * $2/item = $190.

Therefore, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is $190.

The final answer is: $190"
"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we must first establish the individual capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck, being capable of hauling 800 pounds more than Gissela's, can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. When Gary joins them, the total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. To find the capacity of Gary's truck, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Capacity of Gary's truck = Total capacity - Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks
= 11,600 - 8,800
= 2,800 pounds

Therefore, the capacity of Gary's truck is 2,800 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2800}$"
"In the case of Larry v. Dumpling Consumption, we have a scenario where Larry cooked dumplings for a group of friends consisting of 8 males and 6 females. Each male consumed one more dumpling than each female. Given that each female ate 3 dumplings, we can calculate the total number of dumplings consumed by the females as 6 * 3 = 18.

Since each male consumed one more dumpling than each female, each male consumed 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. Therefore, the total number of dumplings consumed by the males is 8 * 4 = 32.

To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we must consider the total number of dumplings consumed by both males and females. This is calculated as 18 (dumplings consumed by females) + 32 (dumplings consumed by males) = 50.

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the amount of money Gerald had left after spending $10 on a book, we must first establish the initial distribution of funds between Gerald and Julia. The ratio of their shares is 3:2, indicating that Gerald's share is 3 out of a total of 5 parts.

To calculate Gerald's initial amount, we multiply the total amount of money ($100) by the fraction representing his share (3/5).

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * 100 = 60

Subsequently, we subtract the amount Gerald spent on a book ($10) from his initial amount to determine the remaining funds.

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10 = 50

Therefore, Gerald had $50 left after purchasing the book.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we must first establish the turtle's speed. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, and the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can calculate the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The turtle's speed is 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second.

Now, we can calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we must first calculate the amount they need to raise per hour. 

The amount raised in the first 3 hours is $2100. To find the amount raised per hour, we divide the total amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. The remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we must first establish the percentage of water utilized by the city. It is given that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

Next, we need to calculate the percentage of this 40% that is used for industrial purposes. It is stated that 80% of the water used by the city is utilized for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage used for industrial purposes is 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 
40% - 32% = 8%.

Therefore, the correct answer is 8%."
"To determine the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we must first calculate the total number of days in the given period. Since a standard week consists of 7 days, two weeks would comprise 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Given that Alex charges $12 per day, we can calculate the total amount by multiplying the number of days by the daily charge: 
14 days * $12/day = $168

Therefore, the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring is $168.

The final answer is: $168"
"To determine the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we must first establish the production rate of each type of ice cream.

The factory produces 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. This indicates a production rate of 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour for chocolate ice cream.

Similarly, the factory produces 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours, resulting in a production rate of 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour for vanilla ice cream.

Now, we can calculate the total quarts of each type of ice cream produced in 48 hours. For chocolate ice cream, this would be 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts. For vanilla ice cream, this would be 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts.

Therefore, the total quarts of ice cream produced in 48 hours would be 2400 + 600 = 3000.

The final answer is: 3000"
"To determine the total bill, we must first calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

The cost of the croissants is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00. 
The cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00. 
The cost of the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. 
The cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost before the discount is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

As Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount, we must calculate the discount amount. 
The discount is 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

Therefore, the total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should purchase, we must first consider the terms of the deal offered by the ice cream parlor. The deal stipulates that for every two scoops purchased, Erin will receive one additional scoop free of charge.

Given that each scoop costs $1.50, Erin has a total of $6.00 to spend. To maximize her purchase, she should first calculate the number of scoops she can buy with her available funds.

Dividing $6.00 by $1.50 yields 4 scoops. However, this calculation does not take into account the deal's terms. To take advantage of the offer, Erin should purchase 2 scoops and receive 1 free scoop, totaling 3 scoops for the price of 2.

With the remaining $1.50, Erin can purchase an additional scoop, bringing her total to 4 scoops.

Therefore, the most advantageous course of action for Erin is to purchase 4 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the difference in the amount of candy between Ginger and Amy after two weeks, we must first calculate the total number of candies each consumes during this period.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day. Over a period of 14 days, she would have consumed 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Similarly, Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day. Over a period of 14 days, she would have consumed 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Now, we calculate the remaining candies for each individual. Ginger started with 100 pieces and consumed 56, leaving her with 100 - 56 = 44 pieces.

Amy also started with 100 pieces and consumed 42, leaving her with 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

To find the difference in the amount of candy between Amy and Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

Therefore, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles required to cover two thirds of Mr. Boarden's 36 sq ft bathroom, we must first calculate the area to be covered.

Two thirds of 36 sq ft is calculated as (2/3) * 36. Multiplying 2 by 36 gives 72, and dividing 72 by 3 yields 24.

Therefore, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 sq ft. Given that he requires 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, the total number of tiles needed for 24 sq ft is 24 * 24 = 576.

**The final answer is: 576**"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a comparison of the costs associated with picking blueberries versus purchasing them at a store. To determine the amount saved, we must first calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and the total cost of purchasing them at the store.

The initial cost of going blueberry picking is $20. Additionally, there is a cost of $1.5 per pound for the blueberries picked. James picked 30 pounds of blueberries, so the total cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

On the other hand, the cost of purchasing the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of picking the blueberries from the cost of purchasing them at the store: $75 (store price) - $65 (picking price) = $10.

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries rather than purchasing them at the store.

The final answer is: $10"
"In the context of a commercial transaction, a company's purchase of 500 computers at an increased price due to a 10% price hike is a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to determine the new price of each computer. The original price of $700 is increased by 10%, which is equivalent to 0.1 x 700 = $70. 

Therefore, the new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770.

To find the total amount of money the company paid for the computers, we multiply the new price per computer by the total number of computers purchased: 500 x $770 = $385,000.

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To determine the total calories in the omelet, we must first calculate the calories from each component. 

Eggs are 75 calories each, and there are 6 eggs in the omelet. Therefore, the total calories from the eggs are 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

The omelet also contains 2 oz of cheese, with each ounce containing 120 calories. Thus, the total calories from the cheese are 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

Furthermore, the omelet contains an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz. Since each ounce of ham contains 40 calories, the total calories from the ham are 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

To find the total calories in the omelet, we add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

Therefore, the total calories in the omelet are 770.

The final answer is: 770"
"To determine the change received, we must first calculate the total cost of the items purchased. The cost of 6 pencils at $0.50 each is $3, and the cost of 8 erasers at $0.25 each is $2.

"To determine the number of individuals who accept the position at Google, we must analyze the given information step by step.

First, we calculate the number of applicants who receive interviews. Given that 30% of the applicants receive interviews, we can calculate this as follows:

30% of 100 applicants = 0.3 * 100 = 30 applicants receive interviews.

Next, we calculate the number of individuals who receive a job offer from those who received interviews. Since 20% of those who receive interviews receive a job offer, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 30 applicants = 0.2 * 30 = 6 applicants receive a job offer.

Lastly, we determine the number of individuals who accept the position from those who received a job offer. Since a third of those who receive a job offer accept the position, we can calculate this as follows:

A third of 6 applicants = 6 / 3 = 2 applicants accept the position.

Therefore, the correct answer is 2."
"To determine the total amount of rice given to Goldy's cousin and brother, we must first calculate the total number of sacks given away. 

Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. 
Total sacks given away = 3 + 4 = 7 sacks

Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we can calculate the total weight of rice given away by multiplying the total number of sacks by the weight per sack.

Total kilograms given away = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

Therefore, the total amount of rice given to Goldy's cousin and brother is 175 kilograms.

"To determine the difference in the number of cereal boxes purchased by Castle this week and last week, we must first calculate the total number of boxes acquired this week. Castle purchased 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, resulting in a total of 3 + 5 = 8 boxes.

Next, we compare this total to the number of boxes purchased last week, which was 4. To find the difference, we subtract the number of boxes purchased last week from the total number of boxes purchased this week: 8 - 4 = 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is 4."
"To determine the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we must calculate the total number of taps for each scenario and then add them together.

First, let's consider the scenario where Helga's arms are at her sides. In this case, her right foot taps at a rate of 300 times per minute, and her left foot taps at a rate of 250 times per minute. Therefore, the total number of taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550.

Since Helga dances for 3 minutes with her arms at her sides, the total number of taps in this scenario is 550 * 3 = 1650.

Next, let's consider the scenario where Helga raises her arms. In this case, her right and left feet each tap at a rate of 200 times per minute. Therefore, the total number of taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400.

Since Helga dances for 2 minutes with her arms raised, the total number of taps in this scenario is 400 * 2 = 800.

To find the combined total number of taps, we add the total number of taps from both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"In this scenario, we have a situation where Ron is faced with a dilemma. On one hand, if he doesn't fix the pothole, it will cause $450 worth of damage to his car. On the other hand, if he fixes it himself, he will incur a fine of $120 for unauthorized road maintenance and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, which amounts to $75.

To determine the total cost of fixing the pothole, we need to add the fine and the cost of the asphalt. This gives us a total of $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, we can calculate the amount Ron saves by fixing the pothole by subtracting the total cost of fixing it from the damage it will cause to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is: $255"
"To determine the number of chairs remaining in the restaurant, we must first calculate the total number of chairs sent for repair and then subtract that from the initial total number of chairs.

The restaurant initially had 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs, totaling 193 chairs.

The number of chairs sent for repair consists of 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs, which amounts to 33 chairs in total.

To find the number of chairs remaining, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the initial total:

193 (initial total) - 33 (chairs sent for repair) = 160

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

The final answer is: 160"
"To determine the number of slices of pizza left, we must first calculate the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his friends. 

Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these three individuals as follows:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these two friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we add the total number of slices eaten by all five friends:

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since there are a total of 5 friends, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:

5 friends * 12 slices/friend = 60 slices

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

However, this is not the correct answer. We must consider that Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and the other two friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. This means that the two friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas ate 3 slices more than the other three friends. 

The two friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas ate 9 slices each, while the other three friends ate 8 slices each. So, the total number of slices eaten by the two friends who ate ¾ of their pizzas is 18 slices, and the total number of slices eaten by the other three friends is 24 slices.

"To determine the average time it takes for a cat and a dog to eat the same number of sausages, we must first establish the time it takes for each animal to consume the sausages.

Given that the cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes, we can infer that the dog, which eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, will consume the sausages in 2/3 * 30 minutes.

Calculating the time taken by the dog: (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

To find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog, we will calculate the mean of their respective times.

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

Therefore, the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we must first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, 8 feet equals 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding 4 inches to that gives us a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can express this relationship as an equation: x * 9 + 10 = 100.

To solve for 'x', we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation, yielding x * 9 = 90. Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us x = 10.

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"In the context of this scenario, Hannah's actions can be considered vandalism, which is a form of property damage. To determine the extent of the damage, we need to calculate the total number of windows smashed.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows. Since Hannah smashed a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we can calculate the total number of windows smashed from students' cars as follows:

(1/4) * (64 * 4) = (1/4) * 256 = 64

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows. Since Hannah smashed three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows, we can calculate the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars as follows:

(3/4) * (32 * 2) = (3/4) * 64 = 48

To find the total number of windows smashed, we add the number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars:

64 + 48 = 112

Therefore, Hannah smashed a total of 112 windows.

The final answer is: $\boxed{112}$"
"To determine the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we must first calculate the total number of blue spools. This can be achieved by adding the number of light blue and dark blue spools together.

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we must calculate the total number of spools in Candy's collection. This can be done by adding the number of light blue, dark blue, light green, and dark green spools together.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can calculate the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the correct answer is 40%."
"To determine the number of individuals who had not cast their vote by 16:00, we must first calculate the total number of people who had voted by that time.

At midday, 2/5 of the 5000 individuals had voted. This equates to 2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people.

The remaining number of individuals after midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining individuals had voted. This means 2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

To find the number of individuals who had not voted by 16:00, we subtract the total number of people who voted by 16:00 from the total number of individuals.

5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000

Therefore, the number of individuals who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we must first calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will consume during this period. 

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum daily. Over the course of 30 days, he will consume 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces of gum.

Next, we must calculate the number of packs required to meet this demand. Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. To find the number of packs needed, we divide the total number of pieces consumed by the number of pieces per pack: 120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs.

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we must first calculate the total number of smores needed. 

Nine children will consume 2 smores each, resulting in a total of 9 * 2 = 18 smores. Six adults will consume 1 s'more each, resulting in a total of 6 * 1 = 6 smores. The total number of smores required is 18 (for children) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers serves as the base for 8 large smores, the total number of sleeves needed is 24 / 8 = 3. Given that there are 3 sleeves in a box, the total number of boxes required is 3 / 3 = 1.

Therefore, the number of boxes of graham crackers needed is 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we must first establish the individual ages of each family member.

Dora's age is a given at 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age is calculated as 2 * 15 + 8, which equals 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
Therefore, Dora's mother's age is 38 - 4, which equals 34 years.

To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their individual ages together: 15 + 38 + 34.

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years.

The final answer is: 87"
"In the context of equitable distribution, when a person finds a sum of money and decides to divide it among their siblings, the principle of fairness dictates that the amount should be split equally among them. 

To determine the amount each sibling will receive, we must divide the total sum of money ($20) by the number of siblings (3).

The calculation is as follows:

$20 ÷ 3 = $6.67

Therefore, each of Greg's siblings will receive $6.67."
"To determine the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we must first calculate the weight of each type of book. 

Cindy has two math books, each weighing 2 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of her math books is 2 x 2 = 4 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds, and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, which is 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

To find the total weight of the books, we add the weights of all the books together: 4 (math) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"In a student council election, candidate A received 20% of the total votes, while candidate B secured 50% more votes than candidate A. The remaining votes were cast in favor of candidate C. Given that there were 100 voters, we must determine the number of votes candidate C received.

First, we calculate the number of votes candidate A obtained, which is 20% of 100, or 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Next, we calculate the number of votes candidate B received, which is 50% more than candidate A's votes. This is equivalent to 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + 0.5 * 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes cast is 100. Candidate A and B collectively received 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Therefore, candidate C received the remaining votes, which is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is: 50"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a simple arithmetic problem that involves the transfer of property, in this case, apples. To determine the difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, we must first establish the initial disparity in their apple holdings.

Boris possesses 100 apples, while Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. This means Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Following the transfer of 10 apples from Boris to Beck, Beck's apple count increases to 77 + 10 = 87 apples. Concurrently, Boris's apple count decreases to 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

To calculate the difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the transfer, we subtract Beck's new apple count from Boris's new apple count: 90 - 87 = 3.

Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris after the transfer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount of water Peter has left, we must first calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube. 

For giant cubes, each cube uses 4 ounces of water. If Peter makes 3 giant cubes, the total amount of water used for these cubes is 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water used for medium cubes. Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water, and Peter makes 7 medium cubes. Therefore, the total amount of water used for these cubes is 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

Lastly, we calculate the total amount of water used for small cubes. Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water, and Peter makes 8 small cubes. Therefore, the total amount of water used for these cubes is 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we add up the total amount of water used for each type of cube: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

To find the amount of water Peter has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

Therefore, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice, we must first establish the number of books each possesses.

Clara has 20 books. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, we can infer that Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books.

Given that Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can calculate Alice's total by adding 6 to Steven's total: 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice, we subtract Alice's total from Clara's total: 20 - 16 = 4.

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"In the context of this transaction, we are dealing with a straightforward calculation of total expenditures. To determine the cost of a half-gallon jar, we must first establish the relationship between the costs of a gallon and a half-gallon jar.

Given that a gallon jar costs $5, we can deduce that a half-gallon jar costs $2 less. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. The total cost of 10-gallon jars is 10 * $5 = $50. The total cost of 16 half-gallon jars is 16 * $3 = $48.

To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars: $50 + $48 = $98.

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is $98.

The final answer is: $98"
"In this scenario, we are presented with a class of 50 students, each with their own unique hobbies. We are given that 10 students enjoy baking, 5 students enjoy playing basketball, and the remaining students have a preference for either playing video games or playing music.

To determine the number of students who enjoy playing video games, we must first establish the number of students who enjoy playing music. It is stated that the number of students who enjoy playing music is twice the number of students who enjoy playing basketball. Therefore, the number of students who enjoy playing music is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who enjoy either playing video games or playing music by subtracting the number of students who enjoy baking and playing basketball from the total number of students. This yields 50 - (10 + 5) = 35.

Since we know that 10 students enjoy playing music, the number of students who enjoy playing video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

Therefore, the number of students who enjoy playing video games is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of birds that were scared away, we must calculate one-third of the initial number of birds. 

One-third of 12 is calculated as follows: 12 / 3 = 4

Therefore, 4 birds were scared away. 

Subtracting the number of birds scared away from the initial number of birds, we get: 12 - 4 = 8

Following this, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 

Adding the new birds to the remaining birds, we get: 8 + 20 = 28

Therefore, the current number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we must first establish the total number of students in each class. Given that the two classes collectively comprise 80 students, we can infer that each class has an equal number of students. Therefore, we divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of students in each class: 80 / 2 = 40 students per class.

Next, we are informed that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To calculate the number of girls in each class, we multiply the number of students in each class by 40% (or 0.4): 40 * 0.4 = 16 girls per class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class: 40 - 16 = 24 boys per class.

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of cake slices remaining on the plate, we must analyze the sequence of events as they occurred.

"To determine the profit made by Mark, we must first calculate the total cost and the total revenue from the sale of the magic cards.

The total cost incurred by Mark is the cost of the packs he purchased, which is 3 packs at $1800 each. Therefore, the total cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Next, we calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of the cards. Mark obtained a card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 additional cards with an average value of $50 each. The total value of these 30 cards is 30 * $50 = $1500. Therefore, the total revenue is $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

Therefore, the profit made by Mark is $1100."
"To determine the amount of savings, we must first calculate the total cost for each amusement park. 

For the first amusement park, the cost for adults is 2 * $26 = $52, and the cost for children is 2 * $12 = $24. Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

For the second amusement park, the cost for adults is 2 * $14 = $28, and the cost for children is 2 * $10 = $20. Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

The difference in cost between the two amusement parks is $76 - $48 = $28.

Therefore, the family will be able to save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

"To determine the weekly savings of the tomato vendor, we must first calculate the daily savings. This can be achieved by subtracting the new cost per tomato from the original cost per tomato, then multiplying the result by the number of tomatoes sold daily.

Daily savings = (500 * 0.5) - (500 * 0.4)
Daily savings = 250 - 200
Daily savings = 50

Next, we multiply the daily savings by 7 to find the weekly savings.

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = 50 * 7
Weekly savings = 350

Therefore, the tomato vendor saves $350 per week by purchasing tomatoes from the new vendor."
"In this scenario, we have a straightforward mathematical problem involving the relationships between the number of marbles possessed by three individuals: Carl, Sean, and Cal.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles. It is also stated that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. To determine the number of marbles Cal has, we must multiply the number of marbles Sean has by 2, which yields 112 marbles for Cal.

Furthermore, it is stated that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. To find the number of marbles Carl has, we must multiply the number of marbles Sean has by 4, resulting in 224 marbles for Carl.

To find the combined total of marbles Carl and Cal have, we must add the number of marbles each possesses: 224 (Carl) + 112 (Cal) = 336.

Therefore, the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined is 336.

"To determine the number of additional groups required, we must first establish the total number of students needed for 12 groups. 

The number of students per group can be calculated by dividing the total number of students by the initial number of groups. 

Total students = 54
Initial number of groups = 6

Students per group = Total students / Initial number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we can calculate the total number of students required for 12 groups by multiplying the number of groups by the students per group.

Total students required = 12 * 9
Total students required = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups.

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

To find the number of additional groups required, we divide the additional students required by the students per group.

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

Therefore, the correct answer is 6."
"To determine the total number of chairs rented by Candy in two 4-week months, we must first calculate the number of chairs rented in a week.

"To determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has after trading stickers, we must analyze the transactions she makes.

Initially, Lorraine possesses 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She first trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. This equates to 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers being traded. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she acquires 27 small buttons from this transaction.

Following this, Lorraine retains 3 small stickers. She then trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, which amounts to 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she acquires 20 large buttons from this transaction.

Lorraine now has 20 large stickers remaining. She trades these for small buttons, with each large sticker being worth three small stickers. Consequently, she receives 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from this transaction.

Combining the buttons she has acquired, Lorraine now possesses 27 small buttons, 20 large buttons, and 60 small buttons. Therefore, the total number of buttons she has is 27 + 20 + 60 = 107.

The final answer is: 107"

Joey played 2 matches on Monday. 
He played 1 match on Friday. 
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches played on each day: 
2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

Therefore, the total number of matches played by Joey in one week is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"In the context of a council vote, the outcome is determined by the aggregation of individual votes. Given that the total number of council members is 33, and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, we can establish a mathematical relationship between the votes in favor and against.

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Consequently, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x, as it is stipulated that there are twice as many votes in favor as there are against.

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. Therefore, we can formulate the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x = 33

Dividing both sides by 3 yields:

x = 11

As x represents the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered by Krissa, we must first establish the number of students for each size. 

We know that 11 students require extra-small shirts. The number of students requiring small shirts is twice the number requiring extra-small, which is 2 * 11 = 22 students.

The number of students requiring medium shirts is four less than the number requiring small shirts, which is 22 - 4 = 18 students.

Next, we calculate the number of students requiring large shirts, which is half the number requiring medium shirts, resulting in 18 / 2 = 9 students.

Finally, the number of students requiring extra-large shirts is six more than the number requiring large shirts, which is 9 + 6 = 15 students.

To find the total number of shirts ordered, we add the number of students for each size together: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

The final answer is: 75"
"To determine the final price after a 5% discount on an item marked at $140, we must first calculate the discount amount. This is achieved by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage, which is 5% or 0.05.

Discount = $140 * 0.05 = $7

Subtracting the discount from the original price yields the final price.

Final price = Original price - Discount
Final price = $140 - $7
Final price = $133

Therefore, the final price after the discount is $133.

The final answer is: $133"
"To determine the total duration of the playlists, we must first calculate the total number of songs across all playlists and then multiply that by the length of each song.

The number of songs in each playlist is 300, and there are 20 such playlists. Therefore, the total number of songs is 300 * 20 = 6000.

Each song is 10 hours long. To find the total duration of the playlists, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song: 6000 * 10 = 60000 hours.

Therefore, the total duration of the 20 playlists is 60000 hours."
"To determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win the big race, we must first calculate the number of individuals who have already expressed a preference for either horse #2 or horse #7.

20% of the total 50 people have expressed a preference for horse #2. This equates to 0.2 * 50 = 10 individuals.

The remaining individuals, who have not expressed a preference for horse #2, are 50 - 10 = 40 people.

Next, we calculate the number of individuals who have expressed a preference for horse #7, which is 60% of the remaining 40 people. This equates to 0.6 * 40 = 24 individuals.

Now, to find the number of individuals who have expressed a preference for horse #12, we subtract the number of individuals who have expressed a preference for horse #7 from the remaining individuals. This results in 40 - 24 = 16 individuals.

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win the big race is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we must first establish the relationship between the Pomeranians and the total number of puppies. Given that one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can deduce the total number of Pomeranians.

Since 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate the total number of Pomeranians by multiplying the number of girls by 3.

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up a proportion:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

Therefore, Jana has a total of 27 puppies.

The final answer is: 27"
"In this scenario, we have a straightforward financial transaction between two individuals, Jayden and his sister Ava. Jayden initially possesses $70, which he obtained from selling his photographs. Ava, in a gesture of generosity, contributes half of her $90 allowance to Jayden, thereby increasing his total to $115.

To determine the amount Jayden still requires to purchase the camera, we must subtract the sum he currently possesses from the camera's price. The camera's cost is $200. Subtracting Jayden's current total of $115 from this amount yields $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden still needs $85 to purchase the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house will need, we must first establish the relationship between the three houses. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x.

The first house requires half the number of cases of shingles as the second house, which can be expressed as x/2. 

The third house, on the other hand, requires double the number of cases of shingles as the first house, which can be calculated as 2 * (x/2) = x.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. This can be represented by the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combining like terms yields 5x = 500.

Dividing both sides by 5 results in x = 100.

Since the third house requires x cases of shingles, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"

"To determine the total number of fruits George possesses, we must first establish the quantity of pears he has in relation to the bananas. Given that George has 200 bananas, we must calculate 45% of this amount to ascertain the number of pears.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90 pears

Now, we must add the number of bananas to the calculated number of pears to obtain the total number of fruits.

Total number of fruits = 200 (bananas) + 90 (pears)
Total number of fruits = 290

Therefore, the total number of fruits George has is 290.

The final answer is: 290"
"To determine the number of candy bars Marissa purchased for her brother Jimmy, we must first calculate the remaining funds after purchasing the ball. Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on the ball, resulting in a remaining balance of $80 - $20 = $60.

Next, we divide the remaining balance by the cost of each candy bar, which is $5. This calculation yields $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

Therefore, Marissa purchased 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we must first establish the quantity of oranges required. Given that 5 kilograms of oranges are necessary to produce 1 liter of juice, it logically follows that 4 liters of juice would necessitate 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Next, we must calculate the total cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges is priced at $3. Consequently, the total cost for 20 kilograms of oranges would be 20 * 3 = $60.

Therefore, the total amount Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice is $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we must first establish the number of books read by each individual. 

Ezra has read 300 books this hour. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can calculate the number of books read by Ahmed by dividing the number of books read by Ezra by 2. 

Ahmed's books = 300 / 2 = 150

Ezra has decided to read 150 more books, bringing his total to 300 + 150 = 450 books.

To find the total number of books read by both individuals, we add the number of books read by Ahmed and Ezra.

Total books read by Ahmed = 150
Total books read by Ezra = 450
Total books read by both = 150 + 450 = 600

Therefore, the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is 600.

The final answer is: 600"
"To determine Tanya's total earnings for the two days of teaching, we must first calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches fewer than 3 classes, she does not earn an additional $5 per day. Thus, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

To find the total earnings for the two days, we add the earnings for Monday and Wednesday: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

Therefore, the total amount Tanya earned for these two days of teaching is $110."
"To determine the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we must first calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents, and since there are 4 vanilla scents available, the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

Similarly, the company sold 2 fruity scents, and with 8 fruity scents available, the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

To find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold.

Difference = Number of vanilla scents sold - Number of fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

Therefore, the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the optimal selling price for each ear of corn, we must first calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of the eggplants. Since Bennet sells 20 eggplants at $3 each, the total revenue from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Given that Bennet aims to achieve a total revenue of $135, the remaining revenue required from the sale of corn is $135 - $60 = $75.

With 25 ears of corn available for sale, we can calculate the optimal selling price per ear by dividing the total revenue needed from corn ($75) by the number of ears (25).

$75 / 25 = $3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 to meet his revenue goal.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we must first calculate the total time available and the time devoted to soccer.

The total time available for the weekend is the sum of the hours on Saturday and Sunday, which is 7 hours and 5 hours, respectively. This totals 12 hours.

Tatiana dedicates 3 hours to reading. The remaining time is 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

She allocates 1/3 of the remaining time to playing video games. To find 1/3 of 9 hours, we divide 9 by 3, resulting in 3 hours.

The time spent playing soccer is the total time available minus the time spent reading and playing video games. Therefore, 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours are spent playing soccer.

To calculate the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100. This yields (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the correct answer is 50%."
"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we must analyze the sequence of events.

Initially, Anthony possessed 50 pencils. He then relinquished 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which equates to 25 pencils. Consequently, Anthony retained 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

Subsequently, Anthony donated 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To calculate this, we multiply 25 by 3/5, which yields 15 pencils given to Charlie. Following this donation, Anthony retained 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.

Therefore, the correct answer is that Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total duration of Jack's absence from home, we must consider the time spent traveling to and from the museum, as well as the time spent at the museum itself.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 miles per hour. To calculate the time spent traveling to the museum, we divide the distance by the speed: 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours.

Since the distance to the museum is the same as the distance back home, the time spent traveling back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total time spent traveling is 2 hours (to the museum) + 2 hours (back home) = 4 hours.

In addition to the travel time, Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. To find the total duration of his absence, we add the travel time and the time spent at the museum: 4 hours (travel) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total duration of Jack's absence from home is 10 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left in the box, we must first calculate the total number of wheels required for the toys. 

For the cars, we have 57 units, each requiring 4 wheels. Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228 wheels.

For the motorcycles, we have 73 units, each requiring 2 wheels. Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146 wheels.

The total number of wheels required for both the cars and motorcycles is 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Now, we must subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box to find the number of wheels left. The box contains 650 wheels. Therefore, the number of wheels left is 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

The final answer is: 276"

"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we must first identify the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies.

First, we calculate the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we divide the total number of movies by 3:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can acquire these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:
200 * $6 = $1200

Next, we determine the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we calculate 40% of 400:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

"To determine the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we must first establish the speed at which they hiked. It is stated that their hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Given that their driving speed was 50 miles per hour, we can calculate their hiking speed as follows: half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

With the hiking speed established, we can now calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Using the formula distance = speed * time, we find that the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Next, we need to calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour. Using the same formula, distance = speed * time, we find that the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

To find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked: 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To determine the difference in the scores of Ava and Emma, we must consider the points they receive for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and completing the level within a certain time frame.

Ava receives 10 points for each enemy she jumps on, 5 points for each berry she collects, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when she finishes the level. Emma receives the same points for the same actions.

Given that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, we can calculate the difference in their scores for these two components. The difference in enemy points is 8 * 10 = 80 points, and the difference in berry points is 3 * 5 = 15 points.

However, Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. Since Emma finishes the level in 60 seconds, Ava finishes the level in 60 + 4 = 64 seconds. Therefore, Emma receives 30 points for every second left on the timer, which is 60 seconds, and Ava receives 30 points for every second left on the timer, which is 64 - 60 = 4 seconds. The difference in timer points is 60 * 30 - 4 * 30 = 1800 - 120 = 1680 points.

The total difference in their scores is the sum of the differences in enemy points, berry points, and timer points, which is 80 + 15 + 1680 = 1775 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1775}$"
"To determine the cost of the other two pizzas, we must first calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Next, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

Therefore, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we must first calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. This results in a total of 3 * 5 = 15 bike rides.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we add the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days: 15 + 12 = 27.

Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"To determine the number of white fish Bob bought at the pet store, we must first establish the initial and final conditions of the fish population in his pond.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, totaling 7 fish. After purchasing fish from the pet store, he added to his collection, resulting in a new total of fish that is not specified. However, we do know that the ratio of orange to white fish in the pond is now 2:1.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O. The total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so W + O = 17.

We can express the new ratio of orange to white fish as (3 + O)/(4 + W) = 2/1.

Cross-multiplying, we get 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

Expanding the equation, we get 3 + O = 8 + 2W.

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get O = 5 + 2W.

Now, we can substitute this expression for O into the equation W + O = 17: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combining like terms, we get 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 3W = 12.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get W = 4.

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we must first establish the total distance traveled in a week. Given that the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, and he makes this trip twice a day, the daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy commutes to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can calculate the total weekly cost by multiplying the fuel consumption by the price of gas: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

Therefore, the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car is $15."
"To determine the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, we must first calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent.

The value of the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

The value of the twenties is 10 * $20 = $200. Since she spent 3/5 of the twenties, the amount she spent is 3/5 * $200 = $120.

To find the total amount of money she spent, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent: $35 + $120 = $155.

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"In the context of Ricardo's garden, we have two distinct types of plants yielding different quantities of fruits. To determine the total number of fruits, we must calculate the yield from each type of plant and then aggregate the results.

First, we consider the tomato plants. With 5 plants, each yielding 22 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is calculated as follows: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes.

Next, we turn our attention to the eggplant plants. With 8 plants, each yielding 4 eggplants, the total number of eggplants is calculated as follows: 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants.

To obtain the total number of fruits, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants together: 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

Therefore, the total number of fruits that Ricardo can obtain from his plants is 142."
"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we must first calculate the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

"In the context of a school trip, it is not uncommon for institutions to provide financial assistance to students. In this scenario, the school has agreed to cover half the cost of the trip. 

To determine the amount John is missing, we must first calculate the total cost of the trip and the amount the school will cover. The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school will cover half of this amount, we can calculate the school's contribution as follows:

School's contribution = Total cost of the trip / 2
= $300 / 2
= $150

John has $50. To find out how much he is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the school's contribution:

Amount John is missing = School's contribution - Amount John has
= $150 - $50
= $100

Therefore, John is missing $100 to cover the remaining cost of the trip.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we must first establish the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point.

The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder, so it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

The temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of seashells brought back by the groups, we must first establish the number of groups formed and then calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.

The total number of participants in the scavenger hunt is 90. To form groups, we divide the total number of participants by the number of people per group, which is 9.

Number of groups = Total number of participants / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells. The fraction of groups that brought back seashells is 3/5.

Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups. Each group that brought back seashells contributed 2 seashells.

Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back by the groups is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of people on the train, we must consider the changes in the passenger count at each stop.

Initially, there were 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people disembarked, reducing the total to 172 - 47 = 125. Subsequently, 13 individuals boarded the train, increasing the total to 125 + 13 = 138. Finally, at the next stop, 38 people exited the train, resulting in a final count of 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, the correct answer is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"In the context of a hypothetical currency system based on bottle caps, the value of each cap is a crucial factor in determining the overall earnings. Given that Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day, each worth $0.25, we can calculate his daily earnings as follows:

Daily earnings = Number of bottle caps per day * Value of each bottle cap
Daily earnings = 10 * $0.25
Daily earnings = $2.50

To determine his total earnings for a 30-day month, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days:

Total earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days in the month
Total earnings = $2.50 * 30
Total earnings = $75

Therefore, Damien's total earnings for a 30-day month, based on his bottle cap currency, would be $75."
"To determine Jamie's total earnings for the day, we must first calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. This equates to 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. For 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

Therefore, the correct answer is $250."
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we must first establish the number of male lions. Since the zookeeper has stated that there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can calculate this by dividing the number of female lions by 2. 

There are 12 female lions. 
12 / 2 = 6 male lions.

Next, we must consider the lion cubs. The zookeeper has reported 14 lion cubs.

To find the total number of lions, we must add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together: 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"In the context of a retail transaction, a discount is a reduction in the original price of an item. In this case, the original price of the jeans is $40, and the discount is 25%. To calculate the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

Discount = 25% of $40
Discount = 0.25 * $40
Discount = $10

The price after the discount is the original price minus the discount amount:
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

Now, let's determine the amount of money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill:
Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the jeans is $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total amount of money a company pays to its employees after three months, we must first calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month. 

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"In the context of planning a caroling schedule, it is essential to consider the duration of each song to ensure a well-organized and efficient performance. 

The choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and ""Jingle Bells"" once. The duration of ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds, and the duration of ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds.

To determine the total caroling time, we must calculate the cumulative time required to perform both songs. 

First, we calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" by multiplying its duration by the number of performances: 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.

Next, we add the time required to perform ""Jingle Bells"" to the total time for ""Deck the Halls"": 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the total caroling time is 540 seconds.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we must first establish their respective hourly wages and calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. Following a raise of $0.50 per hour after 2 months, his wage increases to $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Subsequently, after another year, he receives a raise of $1.00 per hour, elevating his hourly wage to $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial wage, which is $10. Therefore, Sally's hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we must first calculate the total cost of each item. 

3 loaves of bread cost 3 x $2 = $6.
2 bagels cost 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we find the difference in cost: $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we must first calculate Nikita's score. 

Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. Since Pierson scored 278 points, we calculate half of this amount by dividing 278 by 2, which equals 139. 

To find Nikita's score, we add 11 to this result, yielding 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, to find the total score, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428.

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign, we must first calculate the total number of students and teachers involved. 

The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class. Therefore, the total number of students is 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.

Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees.

The school also has 40 classes, with an average of 3 teachers per class. Therefore, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

To find the total number of trees planted, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers: 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees.

Therefore, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is 1240.

The final answer is: 1240"
"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then calculate 30% of that total.

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more.

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we can set up the equation: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3: 

14 + x = 100

"To determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we must first calculate the total hours she has played.

In a 2-week period, Kris plays for half an hour every day. Since there are 14 days in 2 weeks, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

Next, we calculate the hours Kris plays in a 1-week period. With 7 days in a week and 2 hours of playtime per day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

The total hours Kris has played is the sum of the hours played in the 2-week and 1-week periods, which is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find the remaining hours needed to achieve the 30-hour target, we subtract the total hours played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"In the context of a highway scenario, the distance between two vehicles is determined by their relative speeds and the time elapsed. Given that the first car is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour and the second car is traveling at a speed of 70 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance between them after 2 hours.

The distance traveled by the first car in 2 hours is 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles. The distance traveled by the second car in 2 hours is 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles.

The difference in distance traveled between the two cars is 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles. This represents the distance that will separate the two cars after 2 hours.

Therefore, the correct answer is 20 miles."
"To determine the total cost of the ring, we must first calculate the total cost of the diamond and the gold. The cost of the diamond is $600, and the cost of the gold is $300. Therefore, the total cost of the diamond and the gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

Next, we must calculate the premium paid for the ring. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. To calculate the premium, we multiply the total cost by 0.3: 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total cost of the ring, including the premium, is the sum of the total cost of the diamond and gold and the premium: $900 + $270 = $1170.

Therefore, the total amount James paid for the ring is $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To determine the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we must first calculate the total number of students who passed the standardized test and the total number of students.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340 out of 500. The number of fourth-graders who passed is 40 out of 100. The pass rate for the fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders. Since the fourth-graders had a pass rate of 40 out of 100, the fifth-graders had a pass rate of 80 out of 100. Therefore, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80.

To find the total number of students who passed, we add the number of students who passed in each grade: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460.

Next, we calculate the total number of students: 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

Now, we can determine the overall pass rate by dividing the total number of students who passed by the total number of students and multiplying by 100: (460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%.

Therefore, the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School is 46%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we must first establish the total number of square inches that can be covered with the available glass chips. Since each square inch requires 12 glass chips, and Milo has 2 bags containing 72 chips each, we calculate the total number of chips as follows:

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Next, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips required per square inch to find the total number of square inches that can be covered:

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Given that the mosaic is three inches tall, we can now calculate the length of the mosaic by dividing the total area by the height:

Area = length * height
12 = length * 3
length = 12 / 3
length = 4

Therefore, the length of the mosaic is 4 inches.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the initial amount of tea at the party, we must first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, resulting in a total of 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

Additionally, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, totaling 16 * 2 = 32 quarts. 

Combining these amounts, we find that the students consumed a total of 6 + 32 = 38 quarts of tea.

Given that there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea consumed to gallons by dividing 38 by 4, which equals 9.5 gallons. 

However, the question asks for the initial amount of tea at the party. To find this, we must add the amount of tea consumed to the amount of tea remaining. Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the initial amount of tea is 38 (quarts consumed) + 10 (quarts remaining) = 48 quarts.

Converting 48 quarts to gallons, we divide by 4, resulting in 12 gallons.

Therefore, the initial amount of tea at the party was 12 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we must first calculate the total number of candies he has available for sale. Initially, Dale had 100 candies. After selling 150, he had 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. However, this is an error, as it is not possible to have a negative number of candies.

To rectify this, we must consider that Dale ordered additional candies to replace the ones he sold. He then ordered 100 more candies. Therefore, the total number of candies Dale has is 100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 candies.

Since Dale has sold 150 candies, we must subtract this from the total number of candies he has to find out how many he still needs to sell. Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, we must consider the exponential growth of the student population. 

Given that the number of students doubles at the end of every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

The number of students at the end of May is 160. To find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May is 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we must first calculate the total number of branches he climbed during the week. This can be found by dividing the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we can now find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by the number of days.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is 84.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"In the case of Rose v. The Vase, we are tasked with determining the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase after a series of events. To calculate this, we must first determine the total number of petals from each set of flowers.

Rose initially picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each, resulting in a total of 3 * 5 = 15 petals. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each, resulting in a total of 4 * 6 = 24 petals. Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each, resulting in a total of 5 * 4 = 20 petals. Finally, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each, resulting in a total of 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

To find the total number of petals, we add the number of petals from each set: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

However, Rose drops 1 petal from each set of flowers, resulting in a total of 4 petals being lost. To find the final total, we subtract the lost petals from the initial total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals.

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is 97.

The final answer is: 97"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a simple division of a shared resource, namely the remaining marshmallows. To determine the number of S'mores each child can have, we must first calculate the total number of marshmallows remaining after accounting for those used and dropped.

The initial number of marshmallows in the bag is 35. John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, which requires 18 marshmallows in total. Additionally, 3 marshmallows were dropped, resulting in a total of 21 marshmallows being removed from the bag. 

To find the remaining marshmallows, we subtract the total marshmallows used and dropped from the initial amount: 35 - 21 = 14.

Now, we must divide the remaining marshmallows by the number of children to determine how many S'mores each can have. There are two children, so we divide 14 by 2.

14 / 2 = 7

Therefore, each child can have 7 S'mores.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total amount of money used at the arcade, we must first calculate the total time played by each individual. 

Jack, being the most skilled player, plays for 4 hours, which is equivalent to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 

Two of his friends, who are less skilled, play for half the time, resulting in 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. 

The third friend, who is more skilled, plays for 1.5 times the time, which is 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played by all four individuals is 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Given that Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

To calculate the total amount of money used, we multiply the total time played by the cost per minute: 840 * 0.05 = $42.

Therefore, the total amount of money used at the arcade is $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the amount of oil used in the salt scrub, we must first establish the relationship between the various ingredients. It is given that the amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance, and the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar. Furthermore, the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, and the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Consequently, the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combining like terms, we get 8x = 10. Dividing both sides by 8, we find that x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

Therefore, the amount of oil used in the salt scrub is 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"In the context of a transaction, the total amount spent by John can be calculated by determining the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then aggregating these amounts.

The cost of the goats is calculated as follows: 3 goats * $500 = $1500.

The cost of the cows is calculated as follows: 2 cows * $1500 = $3000.

Therefore, the total amount spent by John is the sum of the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows, which is $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

**The final answer is: $4500**"
"In order to determine the number of additional cupcakes Paul should purchase, we must first calculate the total number of cupcakes he currently possesses. 

Paul has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which totals 48 cupcakes.

To find the number of cupcakes Paul should acquire, we must subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes required for the party.

Total cupcakes needed: 63
Cupcakes already have: 48

Number of cupcakes Paul should buy: 63 - 48 = 15

Therefore, Paul should purchase 15 additional cupcakes to meet the required amount for the party.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother, we must first establish the initial number of cars Joe possesses. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, we can infer that Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, we calculate the number of cars Joe sells, which is 20% of his total. This equates to 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Furthermore, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

In total, Joe gives away 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find the number of cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"In this scenario, we have a total of $175,000 raised for charity, with $50,000 coming from external organizations. To determine the amount each student contributed, we must first calculate the total amount raised by the students.

The amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

To find the individual contribution of each student, we divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20).

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250 for the charity.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we must first calculate the time she spent walking on each day. 

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply 8 by 60, which equals 480 minutes.

On the second day, she walked for half the time of the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply 4 by 60, which equals 240 minutes.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is the sum of the time spent on each day, which is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we must first calculate the number of cars present in the parking lot when he exited class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, bringing the total to 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter exited class for the lunch break, it is stated that 1/2 of the cars had departed. This implies that 1/2 of 70 had left, resulting in 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars departing.

Consequently, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot when Hunter exited class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we must first calculate his daily earnings. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of cycles he completes in a day by the number of tasks within each cycle and the compensation for each task.

Number of cycles per day: 30
Number of tasks per cycle: 5
Pay per task: $1.20

Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

To find the total weekly earnings, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days worked in a week, which is 7.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

Therefore, John's weekly earnings are $1260."
"To determine the total points scored by Sasha during both games, we must first establish the points scored in each game.

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. 

Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. Therefore, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points scored by Sasha, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"

"In this scenario, we are presented with a mathematical problem involving the distribution of Magic Cards among three individuals: Becca, Smendrick, and PJ. The total number of cards is 341. We are given that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

To solve this problem, we can represent the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Consequently, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each individual possesses. Therefore, we can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides yields:
7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7 results in:
x = 47

PJ has x cards, which is 47. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, which equals 147.

Therefore, Becca has 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"

The number of green eggs is 5. The number of blue eggs is twice the number of green eggs, which is 2 * 5 = 10. The number of pink eggs is one fewer than the number of blue eggs, so 10 - 1 = 9. Lastly, the number of yellow eggs is one-third the number of pink eggs, which is 9 / 3 = 3.

To find the total number of eggs, we must add the number of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

Therefore, the total number of eggs Cindy had is 27."
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we must first calculate the total cost of shipping the book. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
- Cost per pound: $0.35
- Weight of the book: 4 pounds
- Cost per mile: $0.08
- Distance: 20 miles
- Total cost of shipping: (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20) = 1.4 + 1.6 = $2.99

Next, we must calculate the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The purchase price of the book is $32.

- Refund amount: 0.75 * 32 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
- Total cost of shipping: $2.99

"To determine the amount of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we must first calculate the production for the first three weeks.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate. 
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can calculate the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

Therefore, the amount of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week is 14,000 bars.

"To determine the amount of money Roy has saved, we must first establish the amount saved by each individual. 

Eva has saved $20.00. 

Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, which is $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we must calculate the amount saved by Roy, who has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.

To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Therefore, the amount of money Roy has saved is $42.00."
"To determine the height at which Naruto can lift a mountain, we must first establish the relative lifting capabilities of each individual. 

Pompei's ability to lift a mountain 1 inch is the baseline. Saskay's ability to lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei's means Saskay can lift 12 inches. 

Kagiyami's ability to lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay's translates to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto's ability to lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami's results in 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Mason, we must first calculate the distance covered in each segment of his journey and then sum those distances.

The speed at which Mason is traveling is 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours, which results in a distance of 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles. Following this, he takes a rest and then continues for an additional 6 hours at the same speed, resulting in a distance of 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles.

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances covered in each segment: 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

Therefore, the total distance traveled by Mason is 80 miles.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, we must first establish the time it takes for one kangaroo to complete the journey. Given that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed require 18 hours to cross the highway, we can infer that one kangaroo would take 18 hours multiplied by 3, which equals 54 hours.

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it logically follows that they will require twice the time to complete the journey. Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is 54 hours multiplied by 2, which equals 108 hours.

The final answer is: 108"
"In the context of this problem, we are dealing with a straightforward mathematical calculation involving the number of clay dishes made by three individuals: Kora, Rory, and Jada.

The facts provided are as follows:

- Kora made 20 clay dishes.
- Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora.
- Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory.

To determine the total number of clay dishes made by all three individuals, we must first calculate the number of dishes made by Rory and Jada. Since Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora, and Kora made 20, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 clay dishes.

Next, we calculate the number of clay dishes made by Jada, who made twice as many as Rory. Therefore, Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 clay dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes made by all three individuals, we add the number of dishes made by each person: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we must first calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution.

The price of the new laptop after trading in her old one is $600 - $200 = $400. Erika has been paid $150 and her mom gave her $80, so the total amount of money she received is $150 + $80 = $230.

Since Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs: $400 + $50 = $450.

To find the initial amount of money Erika had in her purse, we subtract the amount she received from the total amount she has: $450 - $230 = $220.

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"In the case of Adam v. Apple Slices, we have a straightforward mathematical calculation to determine the number of apple slices remaining after Adam consumes 15 slices.

First, we calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples. Three large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces, yield 3 x 5 = 15 slices. Five small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces, yield 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

The total number of slices is therefore 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam consumes 15 slices, leaving 30 - 15 = 15 slices remaining.

Therefore, the correct answer is 15."
"To determine the number of additional cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we must first calculate the total number of cows required to meet this production goal.

The current milk production rate is 5 liters per cow per day. To find the total number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we divide the desired daily milk production by the milk production rate per cow.

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we must calculate the number of additional cows needed to reach the required total of 5 cows.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 additional cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

Next, we must calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently possesses. He has earned $5,000 from working on weekends and received an additional $200 from his brother, totaling $5,000 + $200 = $5,200.

To find the amount of money Gabriel still requires, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost of the items: $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600."
"To determine the amount of change Thea received, we must first calculate the total amount she paid the craftsman. Since she gave him four $20 bills, the total amount is 4 * $20 = $80.

Next, we subtract the cost of the hat, which is $70, from the total amount: $80 - $70 = $10.

Therefore, Thea received $10 as change."
"In the matter of Craig's financial transactions, we have a straightforward case of expenditure and remaining funds. Craig initially possesses two twenty-dollar bills, totaling $40.

He then engages in two separate transactions: purchasing six squirt guns at $2 each and three packs of water balloons at $3 each. The total expenditure for the squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12. The total expenditure for the water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

To determine the total amount spent, we add the expenditures: $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount to find the remaining funds: $40 - $21 = $19.

Therefore, Craig has $19 remaining."
"To determine the total number of socks and dishes Jack and Peter have together, we must first establish the quantities of each item they possess.

Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can infer that he collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Given that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, Peter's sock collection is 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Furthermore, since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, Peter's dish collection is 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

To calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the quantities of each item: 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 180.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To determine the number of students good at math, we must first identify the total number of students and the number of students proficient in each subject. 

In this case, there are 20 students in total. We are given that 5 students are proficient in math only and 8 students are proficient in English only. The remaining students are proficient in both subjects.

To find the number of students proficient in both subjects, we subtract the number of students proficient in math only and English only from the total number of students.

Students proficient in both subjects = Total students - (Students proficient in math only + Students proficient in English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students proficient in math, we add the number of students proficient in math only and the number of students proficient in both subjects.

Total students proficient in math = Students proficient in math only + Students proficient in both subjects
= 5 + 7
= 12

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we must first calculate the total time available for performances. The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. However, a 10-minute intermission is also scheduled, reducing the total performance time to 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group requires 10 minutes to perform, including getting on and off the stage. To find the maximum number of groups that can perform, we divide the total performance time by the time each group takes: 110 / 10 = 11.

Therefore, the maximum number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we must calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

After 1 year, Brenda will have: $300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525
After 2 years, Brenda will have: $525 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $750
After 3 years, Brenda will have: $750 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $975

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To determine the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we must first establish the total number of floral shirts and the number of floral shirts with buttons. The store has 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons. Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, we need to calculate the number of white shirts with no collars. The store has 40 white shirts, and half of them have collars. This means 20 white shirts have collars. Consequently, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

To find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars, we subtract the latter from the former. Therefore, the difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount the farmer will earn from selling the eggs, we must first calculate the number of trays he can fill with the available eggs. 

The farmer has 900 eggs and each tray can hold 30 eggs. 

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30

Now, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings:
Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75 from selling the eggs.

The final answer is: $75"
"In the case of Mr. Smith's goat sales, we must first determine the number of goats remaining on each farm. 

Farm X initially had 55 goats. After selling 10 goats, the number of goats remaining is 55 - 10 = 45.

Farm Y initially had 45 goats. Since Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as from Farm X, and he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 goats from Farm Y. Therefore, the number of goats remaining in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

To find the total number of goats remaining in both farms, we add the number of goats remaining in Farm X and Farm Y. The total number of goats remaining is 45 + 25 = 70.

Therefore, the correct answer is 70."
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we must first calculate the total number of pairs purchased annually. Given that James acquires 2 pairs of shoes per month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of pairs purchased annually is 2 * 12 = 24.

Next, we divide the total annual expenditure on shoes ($2640) by the total number of pairs purchased annually (24) to obtain the average cost per pair.

$2640 / 24 = $110

Therefore, the average cost per pair of shoes is $110."
"To determine the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, we must first calculate the individual costs and then apply the discount for the red food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 times the cost of a single basket, which is $25. Therefore, the total cost for the green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

Similarly, the cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 times the cost of a single basket, which is $18. Therefore, the total cost for the red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

The total cost before applying the discount is the sum of the costs for the green and red food, which is $75 + $54 = $129.

However, a discount of $2 is applicable for each basket of red food. Since 3 baskets of red food are purchased, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

To find the final cost, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount: $129 - $6 = $123.

Therefore, the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, with the applicable discount, is $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To determine the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned. 

90 rooms / 2 = 45 rooms

Next, we calculate the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms, given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we must first calculate the number of homes constructed each year.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will construct three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. First, we must calculate the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, we will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years is 144.

The final answer is: 144"
"To solve this problem, we must first establish the relationships between the ages of the individuals involved. Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we must re-examine the equation. Let's try to find a whole number solution.

We can start by testing whole numbers for x. Since x is my age, it must be a positive integer.

Let's try x = 8: 8 + (8 + 3) + (8 - 2) + 3(8 + 3) - 1 = 8 + 11 + 6 + 3(11) - 1 = 8 + 11 + 6 + 33 - 1 = 57. This is less than 87, so x must be greater than 8.

Let's try x = 9: 9 + (9 + 3) + (9 - 2) + 3(9 + 3) - 1 = 9 + 12 + 7 + 3(12) - 1 = 9 + 12 + 7 + 36 - 1 = 63. This is still less than 87, so x must be greater than 9.

Let's try x = 10: 10 + (10 + 3) + (10 - 2) + 3(10 + 3) - 1 = 10 + 13 + 8 + 3(13) - 1 = 10 + 13 + 8 + 39 - 1 = 69. This is still less than 87, so x must be greater than 10.

Let's try x = 11: 11 + (11 + 3) + (11 - 2) + 3(11 + 3) - 1 = 11 + 14 + 9 + 3(14) - 1 = 11 + 14 + 9 + 42 - 1 = 75. This is still less than 87, so x must be greater than 11.

Let's try x = 12: 12 + (12 + 3) + (12 - 2) + 3(12 + 3) - 1 = 12 + 15 + 10 + 3(15) - 1 = 12 + 15 + 10 + 45 - 1 = 81. This is still less than 87, so x must be greater than 12.

Let's try x = 13: 13 + (13 + 3) + (13 - 2) + 3(13 + 3) - 1 = 13 + 16 + 11 + 3(16) - 1 = 13 + 16 + 11 + 48 - 1 = 87. This is equal to 87, so x = 13 is a possible solution.

Therefore, the correct answer is 13.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"In the context of Mr. Jackson's fourth-grade class, we are tasked with determining the number of packs of glue sticks he must purchase to ensure each student receives two glue sticks, with the understanding that he can only acquire whole packs and will have some excess glue sticks.

To begin, we calculate the total number of glue sticks required for the students. With 27 students and 2 glue sticks per student, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

Next, we must determine the number of packs required to meet this demand. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find the number of packs needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 / 8 = 6.75.

However, since Mr. Jackson can only purchase whole packs, he must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has sufficient glue sticks for his students. Therefore, he will need to acquire 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river at a specific point, we must consider the changes in water volume over the course of three days.

On the first day, the initial volume of water is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the volume of water doubles, resulting in 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water increases by an additional 6000 gallons, bringing the total to 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we must add the volumes from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To determine the total number of people infected after three days, we must consider the exponential growth of the plague. 

Initially, there are 10 people infected. Each infected person infects six others, resulting in a daily increase of 60 new cases. However, this simplistic approach overlooks the fact that the number of new cases is not solely dependent on the initial number of infected individuals but also on the cumulative total of infected individuals from previous days.

A more accurate method to calculate the total number of people infected after three days is to use the formula for exponential growth: 

A = P(1 + r)^n

Where:
- A is the total number of people infected after n days
- P is the initial number of people infected (10 in this case)
- r is the growth rate (6 new cases per infected person)
- n is the number of days (3 in this case)

However, since the growth rate is per infected person, we need to adjust the formula to account for the cumulative number of infected individuals. This can be achieved by using the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable to exponential growth:

A = P(1 + r)^n

Where:
- A is the total number of people infected after n days
- P is the initial number of people infected (10 in this case)
- r is the growth rate (6 new cases per infected person)
- n is the number of days (3 in this case)

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = 10(1 + 6/10)^3
A = 10(1.6)^3
A = 10 * 4.096
A = 40.96

However, this calculation does not account for the fact that the growth rate is per infected person, and the number of infected individuals increases daily. A more accurate approach is to use the formula for exponential growth with a growth rate that takes into account the cumulative number of infected individuals:

A = 10 * (1 + 6/10) * (1 + 6/10) * (1 + 6/10)
A = 10 * 1.6 * 1.6 * 1.6
A = 10 * 4.096
A = 40.96

However, this is still an underestimation. A more accurate approach is to use the formula for exponential growth with a growth rate that takes into account the cumulative number of infected individuals and the number of new cases each day:

Day 1: 10 * 6 = 60 new cases
Day 2: 70 * 6 = 420 new cases
Day 3: 490 * 6 = 2940 new cases

Total number of people infected after three days: 10 + 60 + 420 + 2940 = 3430

The final answer is: 3430"
"To determine the total amount of money received by Julieta and Rafaela as tips, we must first calculate the amount received by each individual.

Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, each giving $20. Therefore, Rafaela's total tips amount to 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.1, which equals $80. 

To find Julieta's total tips, we subtract $80 from Rafaela's total tips: $800 - $80 = $720.

The total amount of money received by both Julieta and Rafaela as tips is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a simple arithmetic problem involving the distribution of oranges among Jennifer's children. To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remains with, we must first calculate the total number of oranges given to her children.

Jennifer has three daughters, each of whom received 2 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. Additionally, her only son received 3 oranges. Consequently, the total number of oranges distributed among her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

To find the number of oranges Jennifer remains with, we must subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges purchased. Therefore, 12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given to children) = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber within a 1-year time frame, we must first establish the rate at which each individual earns badges.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. Given that Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, Amber's rate is 1/2 badge per month. Wendy, on the other hand, earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, resulting in a rate of 3 badges per month.

Over the course of 12 months, the total badges earned by each individual can be calculated as follows:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

Therefore, the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber within a 1-year time frame is 30 badges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount raised by Paige, we must first calculate the total number of slices she sold. Since she baked 2 loaves per hour and baked for 5 hours, she baked a total of 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100, as there are 100 cents in a dollar. Therefore, each slice is sold for 50 / 100 = 0.5 dollars.

Now, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to find the total amount raised:

80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars

However, this is not the final answer. We must also consider the time frame in which she sold the slices. Since she sold all the slices, we must calculate the total number of slices sold per hour. 

She baked 2 loaves per hour, and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she sold 2 * 8 = 16 slices per hour. 

Since she sold all the slices, she sold 16 slices per hour for 5 hours. Therefore, the total number of slices sold is 16 * 5 = 80 slices.

The total amount raised is still 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total number of coins Gretchen has, we must first establish the number of silver coins she possesses. 

Given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can deduce the number of silver coins by subtracting 30 from the number of gold coins.

The number of silver coins is 70 - 30 = 40.

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of silver coins to the number of gold coins: 40 (silver coins) + 70 (gold coins) = 110.

Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we must first calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George.

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Additionally, Mr. George consumed 20 burritos.

The total number of burritos consumed is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos in total, the number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, we must first establish the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Given that there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars, which is 3 times the number of green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the overall number of cars in the rink, which is 75. Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the number of books Fawn has, we must first establish the relationship between the number of books each individual possesses. 

Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, which can be expressed as S = A + 25.

Additionally, we are informed that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, which can be expressed as A = F - 12.

We can now combine these two equations to find the relationship between Fawn's and Sofie's books. Substituting the first equation into the second equation yields S = (F - 12) + 25, which simplifies to S = F + 13.

Furthermore, we are given that the total number of books among the three individuals is 85. This can be expressed as S + A + F = 85.

Substituting the equation S = F + 13 into the equation S + A + F = 85, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85. Combining like terms yields 2F + A + 13 = 85.

Substituting the equation A = F - 12 into the equation 2F + A + 13 = 85, we get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85. Combining like terms yields 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation 3F + 1 = 85 results in 3F = 84.

Dividing both sides of the equation 3F = 84 by 3 yields F = 28.

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we must first establish the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh twice as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Next, we must calculate the weight of the carrots, which is 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To determine the total cost of Jello for Greg's son's birthday party, we must first calculate the total number of Jello cups required. Given that there will be 30 children and each child will receive 4 Jello cups, the total number of Jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Next, we need to determine the number of boxes of Jello required. Since one box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, the number of boxes needed is 120 / 10 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the Jello. The cost of one box of Jello is $1.25. Therefore, the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the amount of change the seller should give back, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones and subtract that from the amount given.

The electronics seller purchased 5 phones at $700 each. The total cost of the phones is calculated as follows:
5 phones * $700 = $3500

Now, we need to find the change by subtracting the total cost of the phones from the amount given by the seller, which is $4000.
$4000 - $3500 = $500

Therefore, the seller should give back $500 in change.

The final answer is: $500"
"To determine the amount Keenan spends per week, we must first calculate his share of the total monthly expenses. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%.

40% of $400 is calculated as 0.4 x 400 = $160. This represents Keenan's share of the monthly expenses.

To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly expenses by the number of weeks in the month. In this case, there are 4 weeks in the month.

$160 / 4 = $40.

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries."
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we must calculate the pieces consumed on each day and sum them up.

First, we calculate the pieces eaten on the first day: 2/5 of 60 pieces.
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

Next, we calculate the pieces eaten on the second day: 10 pieces.

Then, we calculate the pieces eaten on the third day: 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total: 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

Now, we calculate 7/13 of the remaining pieces: 7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

To find the total number of pieces eaten, we add the pieces eaten on each day: 24 + 10 + 14 = 48.

Therefore, the total number of pizza pieces eaten by Tobias is 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we must first establish the cost per unit of each item. 

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

Similarly, the cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

Therefore, the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.

**The final answer is: $13.00**"
"To determine the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we must first calculate the total cost of the bolts. This can be done by multiplying the number of bolts by the cost per bolt.

The number of bolts David wishes to purchase is 16, and the cost per bolt is $0.03. Therefore, the total cost of the bolts is:

16 bolts * $0.03 per bolt = $0.48

Next, we must subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has. David initially has $12.48. Subtracting the total cost of the bolts from this amount yields:

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

Therefore, after purchasing the bolts, David has $12.00 remaining.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking, we must first establish her hourly rate. This can be calculated by dividing the total amount earned by the number of hours worked.

In this case, Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. 

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now, we can calculate her earnings after 12 hours by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours worked.

Earnings after 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked
Earnings after 12 hours = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Earnings after 12 hours = $132

Therefore, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.

The final answer is: $132"
"In the matter of Paul's marbles, we have a straightforward case of a change in possession. Initially, Paul had 52 marbles. His friend's gift of 28 marbles increased his total to 80 marbles. However, Paul then suffered a loss, specifically a loss of one-fourth of his marbles.

To calculate the amount lost, we apply the principle of division. One-fourth of 80 is equivalent to 80 divided by 4, which yields 20. Consequently, Paul's loss amounts to 20 marbles.

To determine the current number of marbles in Paul's possession, we subtract the amount lost from the total after the gift: 80 - 20 = 60.

Therefore, the correct answer is 60."
"To determine Amy's total score on the history test, we must first calculate the points she earns from each type of question. 

Multiple-choice questions are worth 1 point each, and Amy correctly answers 80% of them. Given that there are 10 multiple-choice questions, we can calculate her score as follows: 10 questions * 80% = 0.8 * 10 = 8 points.

True/false questions are also worth 1 point each, and Amy correctly answers 90% of them. With 20 true/false questions, her score is: 20 questions * 90% = 0.9 * 20 = 18 points.

Long-answer questions are worth 5 points each, and Amy correctly answers 60% of them. With 5 long-answer questions, her score is: 5 questions * 60% = 0.6 * 5 = 3 points.

To find Amy's total score, we add the points from each type of question: 8 points + 18 points + 15 points is incorrect, 3 points + 8 points + 18 points = 29 points is also incorrect, 8 points + 18

"To determine the cost price of the chickens Isaias bought for sale, we must first establish the total revenue he aims to generate from selling the chickens. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens at $50 each, we can calculate the total revenue as follows:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are informed that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total revenue he must generate from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

To find the cost price of the chickens, we must subtract the profit from the total revenue:

Cost price = Total revenue - Profit
Cost price = $11000 - $2000
Cost price = $9000

However, this is the total revenue he needs to generate, not the cost price of the chickens. To find the cost price, we need to consider the total revenue he will generate from selling the chickens, which is $9000. 

The cost price of the chickens is the amount he needs to spend to generate $9000 in revenue. Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, the cost price is the amount he needs to spend to make $9000.

Cost price = Total revenue / (Number of chickens sold / Total chickens)
Cost price = $9000 / (3/5)
Cost price = $9000 / 0.6
Cost price = $15000

The final answer is: $15000"
"To determine the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we must first establish the number of glasses sold by Micah. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, and the total number of glasses sold by both of them is half of the total number of glasses sold, we can calculate this as follows:

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling glasses (excluding Julie) = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Given that Julie sold 14 glasses, we can now calculate the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

Therefore, Julie sold 2 fewer glasses than Micah.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-2}$"
"To determine the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we must calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

First, we establish the cost of the hair service, which is $400. 

Next, we calculate the cost of the manicure, which is one-fourth of the cost of the hair service: 1/4 * $400 = $100.

Then, we calculate the cost of the pedicure, which is three-fourths of the cost of the manicure: 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, we add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

Therefore, the total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"In the context of a hypothetical transaction between Sarah and her friend, we must consider the principles of contract law and the concept of profit. 

To determine the amount of money Sarah will have left over after purchasing a new rope, we must first calculate the total amount of money she receives from selling the original rope. This can be calculated by multiplying the length of the rope (20 meters) by the price per meter ($2).

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Next, we must calculate the cost of the new rope, which is also 20 meters long. The price per meter of the new rope is $1.5.

20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

To find the amount of money Sarah will have left over, we must subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money she receives from selling the original rope.

$40 - $30 = $10

Therefore, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after purchasing the new rope is $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine when Melanie's age will be thrice her present age, we must first establish her current age. Since in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 10 from 18, which yields 8 years.

Now, let's consider the scenario where her age is thrice her present age. We can represent the number of years it takes for this to occur as 'x'. At that time, her age will be 8 + x, and it will be equal to three times her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

We can now set up an equation to solve for 'x': 8 + x = 24. By subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we find that x = 16.

Therefore, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we must first calculate the total cost of the items in her cart.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10. 
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91.

The correct answer is: $91"
"In the context of this case, we are tasked with determining the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts. To do so, we must first establish the total runtime of her final concert, which includes both the extended performance and the encore.

The final concert's runtime is stated to be 65 minutes. We know that this includes a 15-minute encore. Therefore, we can deduce that the runtime of the extended performance itself is 65 - 15 = 50 minutes.

Since the extended performance is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can express this relationship as 2x = 50, where x represents the runtime of her usual concerts.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2, yielding x = 50 / 2 = 25.

Therefore, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"In the context of a civil transaction, the transfer of toys from Argo to Alyssa, Bonnie, and Nicky constitutes a gift. To determine the current number of toys Argo possesses, we must calculate the difference between the initial number of toys and the total number of toys given away.

Argo initially had 200 toys. The total number of toys given away is the sum of the toys given to Alyssa, Bonnie, and Nicky, which is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150.

By subtracting the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys, we can determine the current number of toys Argo possesses: 200 - 150 = 50.

Therefore, Argo currently has 50 toys.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we must first calculate the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, the shop makes 125 chimichangas each day. Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Friday, the shop makes twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday to the number made on Friday: 250 + 250 = 500.

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on those three days is 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To determine the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage, we must first consider the total number of microphones and the percentage that cannot be arranged.

Given that 20% of the microphones cannot be arranged, it follows that 80% of the microphones can be arranged. The total number of microphones is 50.

We can calculate the number of microphones that can be arranged as follows:

80% of 50 = 0.8 * 50 = 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the total number of microphones that can be arranged by 2:

40 / 2 = 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total number of birds Jerry counts, we must first calculate the number of birds in each category and then sum them together.

First, we consider the birds nesting in the bushes, which number six. Next, we calculate the number of birds flying overhead, which is two-thirds of the number of birds nesting. Two-thirds of six is calculated as (2/3) * 6 = 4. 

We also have three groups of eight birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds per group: 3 * 8 = 24.

Now, we add the number of birds in each category to find the total: 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

Therefore, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"In the matter of Lani v. Cookie Distribution, we have a straightforward calculation to determine the equitable distribution of cookies among five jars. 

To begin, we must first calculate the total number of cookies remaining after Lani's consumption. The total number of cookies initially baked was 55, and Lani consumed 5 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies remaining is 55 - 5 = 50.

Next, we must divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars to determine the number of cookies in each jar. The number of jars is 5. Therefore, the calculation is 50 ÷ 5 = 10.

In conclusion, the cookies were distributed equally among the five jars, with each jar containing 10 cookies.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids, we must first calculate the total number of petals on each type of flower. 

The orchids have 5 petals each, and there are 5 orchids. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 * 5 = 25.

The daisies have 10 petals each, and there are 4 daisies. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is 10 * 4 = 40.

Now, to find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 - 25 = 15.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we must first calculate the number of flowering plants. 

First, we find the number of indoor plants: 100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants.

Next, we calculate the remaining plants: 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Then, we find the number of outdoor plants: 75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

Now, we calculate the number of flowering plants: 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, the correct answer is 25%."
"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we must first establish the relationship between the whatchamacallit and the thingamabob. It is given that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. Given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now, we are informed that the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the whirligig as follows:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: 55"
"In the matter of Ellen's daily expenses, we have a straightforward mathematical equation to solve. Ellen's total daily expenditure on her diet consists of two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $3.

Given that the total daily expenditure is $11, we can establish an equation to determine the cost of one carrot. Let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'x'. The total cost equation is therefore 2x (for two carrots) + 6 (for the salad) + 3 (for the yogurt) = 11.

Simplifying the equation, we combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11.

Subtracting 9 from both sides yields 2x = 2.

Dividing both sides by 2 results in x = 1.

Therefore, the cost of one carrot is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we must first calculate his new hourly wage following the pay increase. Prior to the raise, Mark earned $10 per hour. The pay increase is $2 per hour, thus his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. To find the total number of hours worked in a week, we multiply the daily hours by the number of working days: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we calculate Mark's weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours worked in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

Therefore, Mark's weekly earnings are $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"To determine the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, we must first establish the total amount she earned from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. Similarly, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, which is 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. 

Given that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y. 
54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine Harry's weight, we must first establish the weight of the individuals in question. Martin's weight is a given at 55 kg. 

Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's, which equates to 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's, resulting in a weight of 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Lastly, Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's, which is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To determine the profit John makes on his car, we must first calculate the total amount he earns from renting it out. This can be done by multiplying the number of times he rents his car by the number of hours per rental and his hourly rate.

Number of times rented: 10
Number of hours per rental: 3
Hourly rate: $25

Total earnings = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Next, we need to subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

Therefore, the profit John makes on his car is $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To determine the difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph, we must first establish the initial number of notebooks each possessed. 

Martha's initial number of notebooks can be calculated by subtracting the 5 additional notebooks she purchased from the total of 7 notebooks she now owns. This yields 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph has 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha initially had 2 notebooks, Joseph's initial number of notebooks is 3 * 2 = 6.

To find the difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph, we subtract Joseph's total from Martha's total: 7 - 6 = 1.

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a straightforward mathematical calculation to determine the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis on a Sunday morning.

To calculate the total distance, we must first establish the distance rowed by Anis. It is stipulated that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Given that Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate Anis's distance by adding 1/5 of 50 miles to 50 miles.

1/5 of 50 miles is 10 miles. Therefore, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances together: 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

Therefore, the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis on that day is 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a division of property, specifically cookies. The initial distribution of cookies was intended to be equal among Susan's 6 nephews. However, an intervening act by Susan's husband altered the initial distribution, resulting in a reduction of 4 cookies.

To determine the equitable distribution of the remaining cookies, we must first calculate the total number of cookies available for distribution. This is achieved by subtracting the number of cookies taken by Susan's husband from the initial total.

100 cookies (initial total) - 4 cookies (taken by Susan's husband) = 96 cookies

Next, we apply the principle of equal distribution, which requires dividing the remaining cookies by the number of recipients, in this case, Susan's 6 nephews.

96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews is entitled to 16 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we must first calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday, which is 5 + 13 = 18 pages. 
Daniel did not read any pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.
Daniel's total pages read = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

Therefore, the correct answer is 15."
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a situation where a pot of soup is being shared among family members. The pot in question can fill either four adult bowls or eight child bowls. Given that Calvin, his wife, and their two children will be consuming the soup for dinner, we must first determine the total number of bowls that will be used.

Since there are four adults and two children, a total of six individuals will be consuming the soup. As the pot can fill four adult bowls, which is equivalent to eight child bowls, we can conclude that the pot can fill eight child bowls in total.

After dinner, the remaining soup will be used for lunch the next day. Since four adult bowls were used, which is equivalent to four child bowls, this leaves four child bowls remaining. With two children, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, and there will be two bowls left over.

Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch twice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount William spent, we must first calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately. 

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is calculated by multiplying the cost per notebook by the number of notebooks: 5 x $1.50 = $7.50. 

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen, which is $0.5.

To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together: $7.50 + $0.5 = $8.

Therefore, the total amount William spent is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the total amount of material required, we must first calculate the material needed for small and large masks separately.

For small masks, the material required per mask is 2 yards divided by 4 masks, which equals 0.5 yards per mask. To find the total material needed for 20 small masks, we multiply 0.5 yards per mask by 20 masks, resulting in 10 yards.

For large masks, the material required per mask is 2.25 yards divided by 3 masks, which equals 0.75 yards per mask. To find the total material needed for 8 large masks, we multiply 0.75 yards per mask by 8 masks, resulting in 6 yards.

The total material required is the sum of the material needed for small and large masks, which is 10 yards plus 6 yards, equaling 16 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we must first calculate the total number of tickets she purchased. Since she saw each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets is 9 * 3 = 27.

The total amount she spent on these tickets is $216. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine Harold's free time, we must first establish the total hours available in a day. As a general rule, a standard day consists of 24 hours.

Next, we need to calculate the total hours Harold dedicates to his daily activities. He sleeps for 10 hours, which is a reasonable amount of time for rest and rejuvenation. Additionally, he works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, which equates to 8 hours. Furthermore, he spends 1 hour walking his dog, a necessary and enjoyable activity.

To find the total hours spent on these activities, we add the hours spent sleeping, working, and walking the dog: 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walk) = 19 hours.

Now, to determine Harold's free time, we subtract the total hours spent from the total hours in a day: 24 (total hours) - 19 (hours spent) = 5 hours.

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time available in his day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of shoeboxes left in Tim's box, we must first calculate the number of red shoeboxes he used for fishing. Since he used 1/3 of his red shoeboxes, we can calculate this as follows:

1/3 of 9 = 9 / 3 = 3

Therefore, Tim used 3 red shoeboxes for fishing. 

Initially, Tim had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. After using 3 blue and 3 red shoeboxes, he is left with:

Blue shoeboxes: 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoeboxes: 9 - 3 = 6

The total number of shoeboxes left is 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 10"
"To determine the current number of books Joseph possesses, we must first establish the initial number of books he had. Since Joseph had twice the number of books as Sarah, and Sarah has 9 books, we can calculate Joseph's initial book count by multiplying Sarah's book count by 2.

Joseph's initial book count = 9 * 2 = 18

However, it is stated that Joseph lost 2 books. To find the current number of books Joseph has, we must subtract the lost books from his initial count.

Joseph's current book count = 18 - 2 = 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we must first calculate the total number of marbles he gave away. 

Dean gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. To find 1/5 of 30, we divide 30 by 5, which equals 6. 

Additionally, Dean gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find the number of marbles Dean has left, we subtract the total number of marbles given away from the initial amount. 

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine Adam's age in 8 years, we must first establish the relationship between Duncan's and Adam's ages. 

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can express this relationship as an equation: (Duncan's age eight years ago) = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago).

Given that Duncan's current age is 60, we can calculate his age eight years ago as 60 - 8 = 52. Substituting this into the equation, we get 52 = 2x.

Solving for x, we find that x = 26. This represents Adam's age four years ago. To determine Adam's current age, we add 4 to x, resulting in 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38.

Therefore, the correct answer is 38."
"To determine the total acres of the two farms, we must first calculate the acres of Farmer Smith's farm. This can be done by doubling the acres of Farmer Brown's farm and then adding 100 to that result.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Doubling this amount yields 400 acres. Adding 100 to this result gives us 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, we must calculate the total acres of both farms by adding the acres of each farm together. This is a straightforward arithmetic operation.

200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

Therefore, the total acres of the two farms is 700."
"To determine Colby's earnings in a typical eight-hour workday, we must first calculate the total number of packages he completes within that timeframe. It is stated that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. 

Therefore, his hourly production rate is 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an 8-hour workday, his total production would be 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.

Given that he earns $0.20 for each package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.

Therefore, Colby's earnings in a typical eight-hour workday are $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks while solving a sudoku puzzle, we must first establish the time it takes to complete an extreme sudoku. A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes to solve. An extreme sudoku, being a more complex variant, requires four times the duration of a normal sudoku.

Therefore, the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku is 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes.

Given that John consumes a bottle of water every 30 minutes, we can calculate the total number of bottles consumed by dividing the total time by the interval between water consumption.

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles

In conclusion, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle."
"In the case of Benny v. Balloons, we are presented with a scenario where Benny has thrown bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons. The facts of the case indicate that Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon and three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. It is also established that a total of 58 pieces of bologna were thrown and that 20 of the balloons were red.

To determine the number of yellow balloons, we must first calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

The remaining bologna pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons. Therefore, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can determine the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

**The final answer is: 6**"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car requires, we must first calculate the total miles driven within the 30-day period. Given that Jon drives 100 miles per day, the total miles driven can be calculated as follows:

Total miles driven = 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Next, we need to determine the frequency of tune-ups based on the total miles driven. Since Jon's car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed.

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven / 1000 = 3000 / 1000 = 3

Therefore, Jon's car will require 3 tune-ups within the 30-day period.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

To find the total hours worked, we add the hours from each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

Therefore, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three-day period."
"To determine the amount of allowance each girl received, we must first calculate the total amount spent on the birthday surprise. The cost of the cake is $11. The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

Therefore, the amount of allowance each girl received is $14.

Therefore, the total number of students is 56."
"To determine the profit made by the class, we must first calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of lollipops and the total cost incurred in purchasing them.

The total revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of students, the number of lollipops sold per student, and the price per lollipop. In this case, there are 30 students, each selling 10 lollipops at $0.8 per lollipop.

Total revenue = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.8/lollipop
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of students, the number of lollipops sold per student, and the cost per lollipop. The class purchased the lollipops at $0.5 each.

Total cost = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.5/lollipop
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

To find the total profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $240 - $150
Total profit = $90

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we must first establish the number of each type of pet. 

Larry has 3 cats. 

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, which equates to 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

The number of rabbits is 2 fewer than the number of dogs, resulting in 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

The fish tank contains three times the number of fish as rabbits, which is 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Furthermore, Larry has a collection of gerbils that is 1/3 the number of fish, resulting in 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To calculate the total number of pets, we must add the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

Therefore, the total number of pets Larry has is 47.

"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we must first establish the total number of cups allocated to mint tea. Since Lana brews a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and the remaining cups are divided into chamomile and mint tea, we can infer that the remaining cups are 27 - 15 = 12.

Given that the remaining 12 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, we can calculate the number of cups of mint tea in each row by dividing the total number of mint tea cups by 3. 

12 / 2 = 6 cups of mint tea in total. 
6 / 3 = 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

However, this contradicts the initial assumption that the remaining 12 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, we must re-evaluate the distribution of the remaining 12 cups.

If 6 cups of mint tea are in each row, then the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 6 = 18, which exceeds the total number of remaining cups. 

If 5 cups of mint tea are in each row, then the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15, which matches the total number of remaining cups. 

Therefore, the correct answer is 5."
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we must first calculate the total number of trips he can make within the given time frame. 

Given that it takes the sloth 4 hours to complete a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Since the sloth aims to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips, he must collect 24 / 2 = 12 berries per trip.

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we must first establish the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool contains 10,000 gallons, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons.

Next, we must calculate the total amount of water used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the total amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3,000 gallons.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount: 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 gallons.

Therefore, the correct answer is 2,000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine the number of movies Colby can see, we must first calculate the total amount of money he has spent. 

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

Considering he already saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays and 8 movies on other days, the total number of movies he can see is 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we must first calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 
Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories. 
Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To determine the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we must first calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide that number by the total number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs. 
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, which is 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is the sum of the Junebugs removed each day: 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378.

There are 5 days in total. 

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the total number of days: 378 / 5 = 75.6.

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 75.6."
"To determine the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car, we must first calculate the total distance each vehicle covered.

The bus, traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour, covered a distance of 60 miles per hour multiplied by 5 hours, which equals 300 miles.

Similarly, the car, traveling at a speed of 30 miles per hour, covered a distance of 30 miles per hour multiplied by 8 hours, which equals 240 miles.

To find the difference in distance traveled, we subtract the distance covered by the car from the distance covered by the bus: 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we must first calculate the total number of toys Sophie had before purchasing the bouncy balls. This can be done by adding the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings.

The bag of building blocks contains 31 blocks, the bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals, and the tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings. Therefore, the total number of toys before purchasing the bouncy balls is 31 + 8 + 9 = 48.

Now, we know that after purchasing the bouncy balls, Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the total number of toys before purchasing the bouncy balls from the total number of toys after purchasing the bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after purchasing bouncy balls - Total number of toys before purchasing bouncy balls
= 62 - 48
= 14

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine Peter's age, we must first establish the relationship between the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean. 

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J. 

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old: P + Pp + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: Pp = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = Pp + J

From the second piece of information, we can substitute Pp with J + 10 in the first equation:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P with Pp + J in the equation P + 2J + 10 = 100:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total number of water balloons, we must first calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons provided by Maria's mother.

Initially, Maria had one water balloon, and each of her four friends had two water balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons initially is calculated as follows:
1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Subsequently, Maria's mother provided each person with three additional balloons. Since there are five individuals (Maria and her four friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15 balloons

To obtain the total number of balloons, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

Therefore, the total number of water balloons is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"In this scenario, we are dealing with a charity group's yard sale. To determine the number of tables required, we must first calculate the total number of boxes of items they possess.

The group receives 10 boxes from each of 10 donors, resulting in a total of 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. Additionally, they already have 10 boxes in their possession. Therefore, the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Given that each table can accommodate 2 boxes, the group requires 60 / 2 = 30 tables to display their items.

However, the group already owns 15 tables. Consequently, they need 30 - 15 = 15 additional tables to accommodate their total number of boxes.

Therefore, the charity group requires 15 more tables for their yard sale.

The final answer is: 15"
"In the context of a watermelon seed spitting contest, the objective is to determine the average total distance spat by the participants. To achieve this, we must first calculate the total distance spat by each individual and then divide by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey's watermelon contains 40 seeds, each of which she spits 10 feet. Therefore, her total distance spat is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney's watermelon contains 35 seeds, each of which she spits 12 feet. Consequently, her total distance spat is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

The combined total distance spat by both participants is 400 feet (Zoey) + 420 feet (Sydney) = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 (Zoey's seeds) + 35 (Sydney's seeds) = 75 seeds.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the combined total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 feet / 75 seeds = 10.93 feet.

Therefore, the average total distance spat in the watermelon seed spitting contest is 10.93 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10.93}$"
"To determine the financial disparity between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, we must first calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. 

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour. Given that it operates 24 hours a day, it produces 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day. Over the course of 30 days, it produces 1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets.

Similarly, the WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour. Therefore, it produces 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day. Over 30 days, it produces 1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets.

Now, we must calculate the revenue generated by each machine. Each widget sells for $6. Therefore, the Widgeteer 3000 generates 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200 in revenue. The WidgetMaster 9000 generates 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400 in revenue.

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue of the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue of the Widgeteer 3000: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

$64,800"
"To determine the amount Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour option with additional hours over the 24-hour option, we must first calculate the cost of each option.

The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos. 

The 12-hour option costs 1000 pesos, and Cameron needs to add 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark. Since he stays for 17 hours, he needs to add 70 * 5 = 350 pesos for the additional 5 hours.

So, the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, the amount Cameron would save is 250 pesos.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To determine the total amount of hay required, we must first establish the individual needs of each animal. 

Each goat necessitates 5 pounds of hay. To calculate the amount required for the sheep, we must first determine the amount that is twice the amount each goat needs. Twice the amount each goat needs is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 

Since the sheep require 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we subtract 3 pounds from 10 pounds to find the amount each sheep requires: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately. For the goats, 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds. For the sheep, 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay required is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"To determine the number of 25 dollar pens John can purchase after his expenses, we must first calculate his total earnings and then subtract his expenses.

John's hourly wage is 50 dollars, and he worked 6 hours in the week. Therefore, his total earnings are 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars.

John spends 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank. His total expenses are 50 dollars (gas) + 100 dollars (deposit) = 150 dollars.

To find out how much money John has left after his expenses, we subtract his total expenses from his total earnings: 300 dollars - 150 dollars = 150 dollars.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the pencils. John buys 5 pencils at 10 dollars each, so the total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 dollars = 50 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of the pencils from John's remaining money: 150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars.

Finally, we determine the number of 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money: 100 dollars / 25 dollars = 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a simple arithmetic problem involving the calculation of total letter counts. To determine the total number of letters in the words Craig and his brother have spelled, we must first calculate the individual totals for each party.

Craig has spelled 20 words, each with 15 letters. To find the total number of letters in the words Craig has spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the individual totals together: 300 + 350 = 650.

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 650.

The final answer is: 650"
"To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we must calculate the total number of positions available for the children. 

There are 8 children in each row, and there are 7 rows for each of the 5 different schools. 

To find the total number of children, we multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows, and then multiply the result by the number of schools.

Number of children in each row: 8
Number of rows: 7
Number of schools: 5

Total number of children = 8 * 7 * 5
Total number of children = 280

Therefore, the total number of children participating in the drill is 280.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we must first calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. Consequently, the total number of bottles she acquires is 9 * 100 = 900.

To find the number of bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she obtained. 

900 - 58 = 842

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To determine the total amount charged by Patty's Plumbing, we must consider the various components of the service. The visit fee is a fixed amount of $40. In addition to this, labor costs are incurred at a rate of $35 per hour, or part thereof. 

Given that the job took 2.25 hours, we must calculate the labor cost accordingly. This is done by multiplying the number of hours worked by the labor rate: 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75. 

Furthermore, the job required $60 in parts. To find the total amount charged, we must add the labor cost, the cost of parts, and the visit fee together: $78.75 (labor) + $60 (parts) + $40 (visit fee) = $178.75.

Therefore, the total amount charged by Patty's Plumbing is $178.75.

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To determine the financial outcome of James' transaction, we must first calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount, and then subtract the discount to find the final cost. 

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The discount is 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60. 
Therefore, the price after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

Next, we need to calculate the revenue generated from selling the 5 CDs. James sold each CD for $40, so the total revenue is 5 * $40 = $200.

To determine the financial outcome, we compare the revenue to the final cost. Since James made $200 and his final cost was $90, he is in a profit position. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. 

Given the context, it appears there may be a misunderstanding in the question. If James made a profit, he was not ""out"" any money. However, if we are to assume the question is asking for the amount he was ""out"" in terms of the difference between his revenue and the cost of the CDs he kept, we would calculate the cost of the 5 CDs he kept as $90 - $200 = -$110. However, this is not a realistic interpretation of the question.

A more logical interpretation is that James was ""out"" the cost of the 5 CDs he sold, which is $200 - $90 = $110."
"To determine the total earnings from Jen's root crops, we must calculate the revenue generated from each type of crop and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the earnings from the yams: 6 yams sold at $1.5 each results in a total of 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes sold at $2 each results in a total of 10 * $2 = $20.

Lastly, we calculate the earnings from the carrots: 4 carrots sold at $1.25 each results in a total of 4 * $1.25 = $5.

To find the total earnings, we add the revenue from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

Therefore, the total earnings from Jen's root crops is $34."
"To determine the time it took James to cross the lake, we must first calculate the time it took him to swim 60% of the 20-mile distance.

60% of 20 miles is calculated as follows: 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

Given James' swimming speed of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

Following the completion of the initial 12 miles, James rested for half the duration of his swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance to be covered is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James then swims this remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we add the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we must first establish the initial quantity of bread Sam possessed last Friday. It is stated that Sam had seventy loaves of bread.

Next, we calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had: 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 fewer loaves of bread than seven times the amount Sam had. Therefore, we subtract 40 from 490 to find the bakery's total: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a simple arithmetic calculation to determine the total number of stickers Jasmine possesses. 

To begin, we must first establish the initial number of stickers Jasmine received. In this case, she was given 15 stickers for participating in class. 

However, it is also stated that she lost 7 stickers during playtime. To accurately calculate the remaining stickers, we must subtract the number of lost stickers from the initial amount: 15 - 7 = 8.

Following this, Jasmine's teacher rewarded her with 5 additional stickers for her assistance to her classmates. To determine the final total, we must add these stickers to the previously calculated amount: 8 + 5 = 13.

Therefore, the correct answer is 13."
"To determine the total commission earned by Cayley, we must first calculate the commission from the sales of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately.

The commission from the New York Times is calculated as follows: 
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
- Commission = 300 / 100
- Commission = $3

The commission from the Wall Street Journal is calculated as follows: 
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
- Commission = 1200 / 100
- Commission = $12

The total commission earned by Cayley is the sum of the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.
- Total commission = $3 + $12
- Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine Leo's age, we must first establish the age of Marcus, as it is directly related to Leo's age. Since Deanna is 26 years old and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus's age by subtracting 5 from Deanna's age.

Deanna's age: 26
Marcus's age: 26 - 5 = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. To find Leo's age, we must double Marcus's age.

Marcus's age: 21
Leo's age: 21 * 2 = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

The final answer is: 42"
"To determine the number of points Azibo scored, we must first establish the relationship between the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. This gives us two equations: B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since both equations equal B, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, which means B + A + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (A + 20) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45. 

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45. 

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0. 

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10. 

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get B = (D - 10) + 20. 

This simplifies to B = D + 10. 

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get D + 10 = A + 20. 

We can subtract 10 from both sides to get D = A + 10. 

Now we have A = D - 10 and D = A + 10. 

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = (A + 10) - 10. 

This simplifies to A = A. 

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation 2A + D + 20 = 45 to get 2(D - 10) + D + 20 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D - 20 + 20 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = 15 - 10. 

This simplifies to A = 5. 

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we must first consider the printing and layout of the pages. Given that each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side, we can infer that the book is a standard double-sided printing format.

The problem states that the paper, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. This implies that the thickness of the book is directly proportional to the number of pages. Since the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book.

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is 100 pages per inch * 1.5 inches = 150 pages per inch * 2 (since each page is printed on both sides) = 300 pages.

The final answer is: 300"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we must first calculate the total duration of his work period in minutes. Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Converting the hours to minutes, we multiply 15 hours by 60 minutes per hour:
15 * 60 = 900 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the number of 15-minute intervals within the 900 minutes. To do this, we divide 900 minutes by 15 minutes:
900 / 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per interval by the number of intervals:
30 * 60 = 1800

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"To determine the total time Kim slept on her bed, we must first establish her usual sleep duration. Given that she goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., her usual sleep period is 8 hours. 

Converting this to minutes, we have 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes.

However, on the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, at 5:55 a.m. This means her actual sleep duration was from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.

To calculate the total time she slept, we need to find the duration from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. 10 p.m. to 12 a.m. is 2 hours, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. From 12 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 5 hours and 55 minutes, which is (5 * 60) + 55 = 335 minutes. 

Adding these two time periods together, we get 120 + 335 = 455 minutes.

Additionally, we know that she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 455 - 23 = 432 minutes.

Therefore, the correct answer is 432 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{432}$"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we must first establish the initial number of measuring spoons he possesses. Given that he has two dozen measuring cups, we calculate the total number of cups by multiplying 2 by 12.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Next, we establish the ratio of measuring spoons to measuring cups, which is 2/3. To find the initial number of measuring spoons, we multiply the total number of cups by this ratio.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

Following this, we must account for the 6 measuring spoons Jonathan gifted to Pedro. To find the remaining number of spoons, we subtract 6 from the initial number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of remaining spoons to the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after a 2-week period, we must first establish the initial number of occupied beds. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

1/5 of 1000 = 200

Consequently, the initial number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 200 = 800.

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted to the hospital over a 2-week period. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we can determine the total number of patients admitted over 14 days as follows:

50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we add the initial number of occupied beds to the number of patients admitted over the 2-week period to find the total number of occupied beds:

200 (initial occupied beds) + 700 (patients admitted) = 900

Finally, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds:

1000 (total capacity) - 900 (total occupied beds) = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we must first calculate the number of non-work emails. Since she sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of those are work-related, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to family. Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family, which is (2/3) * 9 = 6.

The remaining non-work emails, not sent to family, are 9 - 6 = 3. We then need to calculate the number of these emails that are sent to her boyfriend. One-third of the remaining non-work emails are sent to her boyfriend, which is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the age of Shawna's father, we must first establish the age of Shawna. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, Shawna's age can be calculated as 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Next, we must determine the age of Shawna's father. Given that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can calculate his age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5. Therefore, Shawna's father is 9 * 5 = 45 years old.

The final answer is: 45"
"In the context of a civil dispute, the plaintiff (in this case, Kelly) has alleged that the defendant (Courtney) made an error in reporting the number of people in attendance at a concert. To determine the actual number of attendees, we must calculate the percentage of the reported number that represents the alleged error.

The reported number of attendees is 48. If Kelly is correct that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of attendees by determining 80% of the reported number (since 100% - 20% = 80%).

To find 80% of 48, we multiply 48 by 0.80.

48 * 0.80 = 38.4

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38.4}$"
"In this scenario, we have a situation where three individuals, Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey, are tasked with carrying basketballs from the gym floor to a bag. The problem states that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. We are also given that Jason carried 2 balls.

To determine the total number of balls, we must first establish the relationship between the number of balls carried by each individual. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Similarly, since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2x = 4x balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three individuals is the sum of the balls carried by each of them, which is x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried 2x balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the equation 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x
Total number of balls = 7 * 1
Total number of balls = 7

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we must first establish the total number of holes at the end of the first day. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.

On the second day, they dug 13 holes, resulting in a total of 10 + 13 = 23 holes at the end of the second day.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, leading to a total of 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes at the end of the third day.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

Given that there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

Therefore, the correct answer is 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"In this scenario, we have a situation where three individuals, Amora, Lainey, and Collins, are attempting to share corn chips equally. However, it is revealed that only two of the individuals will receive an equal amount of corn chips, while the third individual will receive 15 more corn chips than the others.

Given that Amora and Lainey received 70 corn chips each, we can infer that Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To determine the total number of corn chips, we must calculate the sum of the corn chips received by all three individuals. This can be achieved by adding the number of corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins.

The total number of corn chips is calculated as follows:

Total = Amora's corn chips + Lainey's corn chips + Collins' corn chips
Total = 70 + 70 + 85
Total = 225

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To determine the cost of travel, we must first calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. This can be achieved by multiplying the cost of supplies by 1.5 (100% + 50%).

The cost of supplies is $400. 

50% of $400 is $200. 

To find the total cost of travel, we add this amount to the cost of supplies: $400 + $200 = $600.

Therefore, the cost of travel is $600."
"To determine the number of Pokémon caught by Stan, we must first establish the relationship between the number of Pokémon caught by each individual. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

From the given information, we know that the total number of Pokémon caught is 339. Therefore, the equation A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, which can be expressed as L = S + 5.

Furthermore, Stan has caught 13 fewer Pokémon than four times the number caught by Adelwolfe, which can be written as S = 4A - 13.

To solve for S, we can substitute the expression for L from the second equation into the first equation: A + S + (S + 5) = 339.

This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Next, we can substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the previous equation: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

Expanding the equation yields A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combining like terms results in 9A - 21 = 339.

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation gives 9A = 360.

Dividing both sides by 9 yields A = 40.

Now that we know the value of A, we can find the value of S by substituting A into the equation S = 4A - 13: S = 4(40) - 13.

This simplifies to S = 160 - 13.

Therefore, S = 147.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"In this scenario, we are dealing with a straightforward mathematical problem that involves determining the total time John will spend watching a television show. 

To begin, we are informed that each episode of the show is 20 minutes in length. Furthermore, it is stated that the total number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. 

Given this information, we can calculate the total number of episodes by dividing the length of each episode by 2, which yields 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we then multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we must calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

The bird's initial flight in a southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour results in a distance of 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles. 

Subsequently, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour, covering a distance of 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Lastly, the bird changes direction and flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, covering a distance of 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

To find the net distance between the two homes, we subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction. This yields 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"To determine the number of brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we must first calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies that were consumed.

Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which equates to 12 individual brownies. Subsequently, she received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, translating to 6 brownies. Furthermore, her friends presented her with 4 dozen brownies, totaling 48 brownies.

The cumulative total of brownies received is therefore 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were consumed, which is equivalent to 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

To ascertain the number of brownies remaining, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received: 66 - 18 = 48.

Therefore, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the total age of all three family members, we must first establish the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, which can be calculated as 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Next, we must calculate Nani's sister's age, which is 25% younger than his. To do this, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form), resulting in 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can calculate the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: 8 (Nani's age) + 16 (brother's age) + 6 (sister's age) = 30 years.

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we must calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

First, we calculate the time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time for polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes.

Then, we calculate the time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes.

Now, we add the time for each type of string together to find the total time: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"In this scenario, we have a straightforward calculation involving a discount on subsequent purchases. The initial phone costs $600, and each subsequent phone is half the price of the initial phone.

The first two phones will cost $600 each, totaling $1200. The remaining two phones, being half price, will cost $300 each, totaling $600. 

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the first two phones to the cost of the remaining two phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the phones is $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a straightforward mathematical problem involving the number of players on two baseball teams. 

Carlton's team has 13 players. The problem states that Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. To determine the total number of players in both teams, we must first calculate the number of players on Zeke's team.

To do this, we add 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team: 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams is 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"To determine the total number of wooden slats required for the fence, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the sum of its length and width by 2.

Given that the garden is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since each foot of fencing requires 2 wooden slats, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of slats needed:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required for the fence is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"In the matter of Mrs. Harrington's orange transactions, we must first establish the total number of boxes she had in her possession. It is stipulated that she purchased 12 boxes of oranges at the market.

Subsequently, she gifted 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, resulting in a total of 4 boxes being removed from her inventory. This leaves her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

Each box contains 20 oranges, thereby resulting in a total of 8 * 20 = 160 oranges in her possession.

Mrs. Harrington then retained 1/4 of the oranges, which equates to 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To determine the number of oranges she sold, we must subtract the number of oranges she retained from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

Therefore, the correct answer is 120."
"To determine the total number of states in both the United States of America (USA) and India, we must first establish the number of states in each country.

The USA is a federal republic consisting of 50 states. 

India, on the other hand, has a federal structure with 29 states.

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA to the number of states in India: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine the number of hours Tyler must work to afford his books, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

The total cost of the items is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he must work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, the correct answer is 5 hours."
"In this scenario, we are dealing with a division of assets, specifically cherries, among three individuals: Richard, Jerry, and Robert. The total number of cherries to be divided is 60.

We are given that Robert has 30 cherries, and it is stated that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. To determine the number of cherries Richard has, we subtract 10 from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract 50 from 60: 60 - 50 = 10.

Given that Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, we can calculate the difference in the number of cherries between Robert and Jerry: 30 - 10 = 20.

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total earnings of Sunny for the two-day fundraiser, we must first establish the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on each day.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. The number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is 4 fewer than the number sold on Sunday. Since we know the number of apple pies sold on Sunday is 15, we can calculate the number sold on Saturday as 15 - 4 = 11.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which is 10 + 5 = 15 boxes. The number of apple pies sold on Sunday is given as 15.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day. The cost of gingerbread is $6 per box, and the cost of apple pie is $15 per box.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

To find the total earnings for the two days, we add the earnings from Saturday and Sunday: 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: $\boxed{540}$"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need for her vacation, we must first calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use. Given that she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day.

Since Pamela will be on vacation for 8 days, we multiply the number of times she reapplies sunscreen per day (4) by the number of days (8) to find the total number of reapplications: 4 * 8 = 32.

Each reapplication requires 1 ounce of sunscreen. Therefore, the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use is 32 ounces.

To find the number of sunscreen bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces): 32 / 8 = 4.

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"In the context of a transaction involving the purchase of two vehicles, a red car and a blue car, it is essential to understand the price differential between the two. The blue car is priced at $100. 

Given that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we can calculate the price of the red car by determining the discount amount. The discount is 40% of the price of the blue car, which is 0.4 * $100 = $40.

Therefore, the price of the red car is $100 - $40 = $60.

To determine the total cost of both cars, we add the prices of the red and blue cars together: $100 + $60 = $160.

**The final answer is: $160**"
"To determine the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother, we must first establish the current ages of both individuals. 

We are given that Emil is 19 years old. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This implies that his dad's age at that time will be twice Emil's age, which is 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Since Emil's dad will be 48 years old when Emil turns 24, we can calculate his current age by subtracting 5 years from 48, as Emil is currently 19 years old. Therefore, Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Next, we are informed that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means that his brother's age at that time will be half of Emil's age, which is 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

To find the current age of Emil's brother, we subtract 5 years from 12, as Emil is currently 19 years old. Therefore, Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we must consider the contributions from her mother, sister, and friend. 

Her mother provided 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which equates to 30 beads. Her friend, on the other hand, gave her twice as many beads as her mother, resulting in 40 beads.

To calculate the total, we add the beads from each source: 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

Therefore, the total number of beads Adrianne has is 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we must first calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught. 

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

Therefore, the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has is 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we must first identify the number of football players in the class. 20% of the 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students.

The remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Next, we need to calculate the number of cheerleaders or band members. 25% of the remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or band members. 

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members. 
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie, we must first establish the individual sizes. Sophie's shoe size is given as 5. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we calculate his size as 5 * 5 = 25.

Now, to find the average, we add their shoe sizes together: 5 + 25 = 30. 

Dividing the sum by 2 yields the average shoe size: 30 / 2 = 15.

Therefore, the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost Pat will incur to fill her flower bed, we must first calculate the number of plants she can fit in the bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant requires 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant, as well as its own width of 1 foot. 

First, we convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, as the width of the plant is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Next, we calculate the total space required for each plant, which is the width of the plant (12 inches) plus the space between the plant and the next plant (18 inches). Therefore, each plant requires 12 + 18 = 30 inches of space.

Now, we can calculate the total number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. The total length of the flower bed is 1332 inches, and each plant requires 30 inches of space. Therefore, the number of plants Pat can fit is 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers. Each flower costs $6 at the store, so the total cost will be 27 * 6 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother consumes in a week, we must first establish the daily consumption rate of the brother. Since the brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar consumes 18 pretzels daily, we can calculate the brother's daily consumption as follows:

1/2 of 18 = 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels per day

Now, to find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7, as there are 7 days in a week.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels/week

Therefore, Edgar's brother consumes 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we must first calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the petunias is calculated as follows: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00.

The cost of the sweet potato vines is calculated as follows: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines, which is $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

Therefore, the total cost of filling the hanging baskets is $70.00.

"To determine the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can purchase in a year, we must first calculate the amount she sets aside each month for this purpose. As a percentage of her monthly income, 25% of $2,000.00 is equivalent to 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year to find the total savings in a year: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Now, we divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

6"
"To determine the time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we must consider the time required for both tasks simultaneously.

First, let's analyze the peeling process. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To calculate the time required to peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes.

Next, we examine the cooking process. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time required to cook 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she cooks them: 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 3 times 10 minutes, which equals 30 minutes.

Since peeling and cooking are performed concurrently, we must determine the longer of the two times. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the maximum time required to complete both tasks is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the final temperature, we must calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner initially ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. This results in a total cooling effect of 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Subsequently, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. This yields a total cooling effect of 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The combined cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine Bill's age when he first saw the comet, we must first establish the age of Bill's father at the time of the comet's appearance. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can infer that the time elapsed between Bill's father seeing the comet and Bill seeing it for the second time is a multiple of 75 years. 

Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This implies that Bill's age at the second sighting is 3 times the age of his father at the first sighting. 

Let's denote the age of Bill's father at the first sighting as 'x'. Therefore, Bill's age at the second sighting is 3x. 

The time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years, and we know that Bill's age at the second sighting is 3x. We also know that the age of Bill's father at the first sighting is x. 

Since the age of Bill's father at the second sighting is x + 75, we can set up the equation: 3x = x + 75 + 30 (Bill's age at the second sighting is 3x, and his father's age at the second sighting is x + 75, and Bill's father was 30 years old at the first sighting).

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = 105. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 52.5. However, since age cannot be a fraction, we can infer that the age of Bill's father at the first sighting is 52 years (the closest integer to 52.5).

Now, we can find Bill's age at the first sighting by subtracting the age of his father at the first sighting from the age of Bill at the second sighting. 

Bill's age at the second sighting is 3x = 3 * 52 = 156. 

Therefore, Bill's age at the first sighting is 156 - 52 = 104 years.

However, this is the age of Bill at the second sighting minus the age of his father at the first sighting, not the age of Bill at the first sighting. To find the age of Bill at the first sighting, we need to subtract the age of Bill's father at the first sighting from the age of Bill at the first sighting. 

However, we know that the age of Bill's father at the first sighting is 52, and the age of Bill at the second sighting is 3 times the age of his father at the first sighting. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the age of Bill's father at the first sighting is 52 years, and the age of Bill at the second sighting is 3 * 52 = 156 years. 

The age of Bill at the first sighting is 156 - 75 = 81 years."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we must consider the frequency of each type of check. 

Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month, which equates to 12 checks per year. Similarly, he writes a check for the gas bill once per month, resulting in 12 checks per year. 

Additionally, he writes two checks to the church every month, totaling 24 checks per year. Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which translates to 4 checks per year.

To find the total number of checks, we add the checks from each category: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52.

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year.

The final answer is: 52"
"To determine the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we must first establish the total number of flights it makes in a day. 

Given that the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can deduce that the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

The first plane's flights are divided as follows: three-quarters are to Greece, and the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we must first calculate the number of flights to Greece, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66. 

The remaining flights are then (88 - 66) = 22. Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is (1/2) * 22 = 11.

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

The final answer is: 11"
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we must first establish the individual howling times.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote, being twice as vocal as Tobias, howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous, on the other hand, howls for the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we calculate the total howling time by adding the individual durations: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60, as there are 60 seconds in a minute: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"In the context of this transaction, we are dealing with a simple financial arrangement between Adam and his parents. To determine the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings, we must first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother provided him with $6. His father, in turn, gave him twice as much as his mother, which equates to 2 * $6 = $12.

The combined total of money received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Given that the trousers cost $30, we can now calculate the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"In the matter of determining the age of Wilfred, we have four children involved: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. The total age of the children is 20, with Akbar being 3 years old and Alessandro being 4 years old.

To calculate the age of Wilfred, we must first establish the age of Helene. It is stipulated that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4 in this case.

The total age of the children is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. We can express the total age as follows: 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

We can now calculate Helene's age by determining the average age of the group. The average age is the total age divided by the number of children.
Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

Simplifying the equation, we can substitute Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
3 + 4 + (7 + W) + W = 20
12 + 2W = 20
2W = 8
W = 4

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is 4 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to consider the donations from the neighbors and the online fund. The neighbors donated $500, and the online fund donated $1500. 

The total amount collected from these sources is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

However, the lawyer's contribution is based on the donations from the neighbors and the online fund, excluding the friend's donation. Therefore, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 is $2000.

The lawyer will donate 3 times this amount, which is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a civil matter involving a wedding reception and a donation to a local church. To determine the number of individuals in the church, we must first calculate the total number of cookies donated.

The total number of cookies is calculated by multiplying the number of guests at the wedding reception by the number of cookies each guest brought. In this case, there were 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

Next, we must determine the number of cookies donated to the church. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the total number of cookies to the church. Therefore, the number of cookies donated to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we must calculate the number of individuals in the church. We know that each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find the number of individuals in the church, we divide the total number of cookies donated to the church by the number of cookies each person received.

Number of individuals in the church = Total cookies donated to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

Therefore, the number of individuals in the church is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we must first establish a baseline for the total watermelon. For the sake of calculation, let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units.

Given that each adult receives twice as much watermelon as each child, we can establish a ratio of adult to child portions. If we denote the amount each child receives as 'x', then each adult receives 2x.

The total amount of watermelon allocated to the children is 4x (4 children * x units each), and the total amount allocated to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combining like terms, we get 6x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each child receives 16.67 units, each adult receives 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 33.33%"
"To determine the amount of time Doctor Jones has available to update his records, we must first calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments. 

The time spent on rounds is calculated by multiplying the number of inpatients by the time spent per inpatient. In this case, there are 9 inpatients, and each requires 20 minutes of Doctor Jones' time. Therefore, the total time spent on rounds is 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time spent on appointments. Doctor Jones has 10 appointments, each lasting 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

The total time spent on rounds and appointments is the sum of the time spent on each, which is 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Since Doctor Jones works a total of 9 hours, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours to determine the time available for updating his records. This is calculated as 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, the time available for updating Doctor Jones' records is 1 hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm, we must calculate the total time required to complete the cake-making process.

The time to make the cake batter is 20 minutes, the time to bake the cake is 30 minutes, the time to cool the cake is 2 hours (120 minutes), and the time to frost the cake is 10 minutes. 

Adding these times together, we get: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Converting 180 minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Therefore, Jordan needs 3 hours to make the cake. To be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm, she should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"In the context of this transaction, we have two parties, Lisa and Peter, who are engaged in a joint venture of selling chocolate bars door-to-door. The facts of the case indicate that Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars, while Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they collectively sold 64 chocolate bars.

To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we must first establish the total number of boxes sold by both parties. This can be calculated by adding the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter, which gives us 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Now, to find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars sold (64) by the total number of boxes sold (8). This calculation yields:

64 ÷ 8 = 8

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we must first calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session. The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. Therefore, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

To find the total earnings per month, we multiply the total cost per session by the number of sessions in a month: $40 * 12 = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"In this scenario, we are presented with a problem involving the distribution of chocolate bars among Peter and Martha. To determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for both individuals, we must first divide the total number of chocolate bars by the respective number of boxes.

For Peter, with a total of 64 chocolate bars and 4 boxes, the calculation yields 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars per box. Similarly, for Martha, with a total of 56 chocolate bars and 7 boxes, the calculation yields 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars per box.

To find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

Therefore, the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the population of porcupines in the park after a year, we must first calculate the number of female porcupines. The problem states that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.

Given the total population of porcupines is 50, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we add the initial population to the number of babies born.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we must first calculate the volume of the pool. The pool's dimensions are 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. 

The formula to calculate the volume of a rectangular pool is: Volume = width * length * depth.

Applying the given dimensions, we get:
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

However, the pool company requires the volume to be multiplied by 5.9 to determine the gallons of water needed. Therefore, we calculate:
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $826.

Similarly, Shandy's distance is calculated by multiplying his speed by the duration of his travel: 45 miles per hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

To find the difference in their distances, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is: 230"
"To determine the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we must first break down the student population into two categories: those over 16 years old and those under 16 years old.

The total number of students is 3000. Half of these students are over 16 years old, which equates to 1500 students. Conversely, the remaining half are under 16 years old, also totaling 1500 students.

Within the 1500 students over 16, one-fourth are male, which is 375 students. Consequently, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Similarly, within the 1500 students under 16, one-half are male, which is 750 students. Therefore, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

Therefore, the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School is 1875.

"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we must first calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank. 

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

The amount of water remaining in the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank is 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To determine the initial charge of Maria's power bank, we must analyze the given information and apply mathematical principles to deduce the correct answer.

The power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours. After this period, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 55%.

Subsequently, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. The charge remaining after this period is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we are informed that the final charge remaining is 28%. This indicates that the 34% remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% in the last 3 hours. To find the charge remaining after 8 hours, we need to determine the amount of charge lost in the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the charge remaining after 8 hours is y. Then, the charge lost in the last 3 hours is y - 28%. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

Therefore, we can establish the equation: y - 28% = 6%.

Solving for y, we find that y = 34%.

Now, we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%. We also know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%. To find the initial charge, we need to determine the amount of charge lost in the first 5 hours.

The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 34% = 21%.

Consequently, we can establish the equation: x - 21% = 34%.

Solving for x, we find that x = 55%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 55%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we must first calculate her total weekly earnings. As a waitress, she earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, resulting in a total hourly wage of $25.

Given that she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to calculate the amount Janet needs to save for the down payment. She aims to save 20% of the car's cost, which is $10,000. To find 20% of $10,000, we multiply $10,000 by 0.2, resulting in $2000.

To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2

Therefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can purchase, we must first calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already acquired. 

Peaches cost $0.5 each, and he has purchased 3, so the total cost for peaches is 3 * $0.5 = $1.5. 
Pears also cost $0.5 each, and he has purchased 4, so the total cost for pears is 4 * $0.5 = $2. 
Kiwis cost $1 each, and he has purchased 2, so the total cost for kiwis is 2 * $1 = $2. 
Apples cost $0.75 each, and he has purchased 5, so the total cost for apples is 5 * $0.75 = $3.75.

The total cost of the fruits he has already purchased is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25.

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

To find out how many plums he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3.

Therefore, Jamaar can purchase 3 plums.

"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we must first calculate the total number of packs given to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, leaving 15 - 2 = 13 packs to be distributed among her friends.

Since the sweets were given equally to 10 friends, we divide the number of packs by the number of friends: 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Now, we calculate the number of pieces in 1.3 packs. Each pack contains 60 pieces, so 1 pack has 60 pieces. 

To find the number of pieces in 0.3 packs, we multiply 0.3 by 60: 0.3 * 60 = 18 pieces.

Therefore, each friend received 60 + 18 = 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the price of carrots after three years, we must consider the annual increase in price. The initial price of carrots is $120. Each year, the price increases by 5% of the original price.

Year 1: 
The price increase is 5% of $120, which is 0.05 * $120 = $6. Therefore, the price after one year is $120 + $6 = $126.

Year 2: 
The price increase is 5% of $126, which is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30. Thus, the price after two years is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Year 3: 
The price increase is 5% of $132.30, which is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615. Consequently, the price after three years is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies Olivia had, we must first calculate the total number of pictures in each album. 

Given that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and distributed them evenly across 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Since 3 albums were dedicated to selfies, the total number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums = 5 albums. 
The number of portraits is 5 albums * 9 pictures per album = 45 portraits.

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies is 27 selfies + 45 portraits = 72.

"To determine the number of small stuffed animals sold by Teresa, we must first establish the relationship between the sales of small and large stuffed animals. It is given that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. This can be represented as x = 2y, where x is the number of small stuffed animals and y is the number of large stuffed animals.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is three times that amount, which is $12. The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. This can be represented as 4x + 12y = 120.

Substituting x = 2y into the equation 4x + 12y = 120, we get 4(2y) + 12y = 120. Simplifying this equation, we get 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold by Teresa is 12.

To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we must first identify the total number of eggs, the number of eggs found by the Smith twins, and the number of eggs that remained unfound.

The total number of eggs is 100. The Smith twins, being identical twins, each found 30 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins is 30 * 2 = 60.

However, we are informed that all the other eggs, except for 10, were found by their friends. This implies that the remaining eggs, after the Smith twins' discovery, are the ones found by the friends. To calculate the number of eggs found by the friends, we subtract the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

Therefore, the correct answer is 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days, we must first establish the daily ore mining capacity of a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe.

A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, his capacity doubles to 24 pounds per day. When utilizing a steel pickaxe, his capacity increases by 50% over the iron pickaxe, which is equivalent to 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. Therefore, with a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

To calculate the daily ore mining capacity of 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, we multiply the individual capacity by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

To find the monthly ore mining capacity, we multiply the daily capacity by the number of days in the month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

Therefore, the correct answer is 43200 pounds."
"To determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we must first establish the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6. 

We can calculate the price per sandwich for the first package by dividing the price by the number of sandwiches: $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Similarly, we can calculate the price per sandwich for the second package: $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, we can apply this ratio to the third package with 8 sandwiches. 

To find the total price for the third package, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the monthly payment for the bedroom set, we must first calculate the remaining balance after Tom sells his old bedroom set for $1000.

The total cost of the bedroom set is $3000. After selling his old bedroom set for $1000, Tom has $1000 to apply towards the purchase. Therefore, the remaining balance is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Next, we need to calculate the monthly payment based on the remaining balance and the interest rate of 10% per month. To do this, we multiply the remaining balance by the interest rate:

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

Therefore, Tom must pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we must consider the sequence of events that affected the number of balloons.

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. This means 40% of 25 red balloons were lost, leaving 60% of the original number of red balloons. To calculate the number of red balloons remaining, we multiply 25 by 0.6, which equals 15.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. This means she released 50% of the original number of yellow balloons, leaving 50% of the original number of yellow balloons. To calculate the number of yellow balloons remaining, we multiply 12 by 0.5, which equals 6.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. To calculate the number of blue balloons added, we multiply 8 by 0.75, which equals 6.

Now, we can calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school by adding the remaining red balloons, the remaining yellow balloons, the green balloons, and the blue balloons added: 15 (red) + 6 (yellow) + 7 (green) + 6 (blue) = 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios in which he will not have to turn it in and subtract that probability from 100%.

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework:

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance)
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance)
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance of convincing the teacher, multiplied by 60% chance of the teacher not giving an extension, which equals 12%)

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. 

To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100%. However, since the total probability of not having to turn in his homework is 102%, we need to subtract 100% from 102% to get 2%. However, this is not possible since the probability cannot be greater than 100%. 

To resolve this issue, we can subtract 100% from 102% to get -2% and then add 100% to -2% to get 98%. 

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 98%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate can receive, we must first calculate the available seating in the Fine Arts Center after accounting for reserved seats.

The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 people. There are 950 reserved seats for graduates and 300 reserved seats for faculty. 

Total reserved seats = 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250
Available seats = Total capacity - Total reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 1250
Available seats = 4750

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

Therefore, each graduate can receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we must first establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. It is given that 75 large jelly beans are equivalent to the amount needed to fill Grandpa up.

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can consume 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Furthermore, it is stated that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, we can establish a ratio of small beans to medium beans as 3:1.

To find the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we can multiply the number of medium beans by 3. This yields 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

The final answer is: 450"
"As a legal expert, I can calculate Melissa's hourly pay after expenses by first determining her net earnings. To do this, we need to subtract her total expenses from her total earnings.

Melissa's total earnings are $15 per day, and she serves for 3 days. Therefore, her total earnings are $15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses for parking are $3 per day, and she serves for 3 days. Thus, her total expenses are $3 * 3 = $9.

Now, let's calculate her net earnings:
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Next, we need to determine the total number of hours she worked. Since she serves 6 hours a day for 3 days, her total hours are 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find her hourly pay after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours:
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"In the context of a financial transaction, the total amount spent by an individual can be calculated by adding the costs of the items purchased. In this scenario, Ted initially had $200. He then acquired 3 books at a cost of $16 each and 3 pencils at a cost of $6 each.

To determine the total amount spent, we must first calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils. The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = $48. The cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = $18.

The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils, which is $48 + $18 = $66.

Therefore, the total amount spent by Ted is $66.

The final answer is: $66"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we must first calculate the total number of soda bottles he will place along his driveway. Given that the driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can calculate the total number of bottles as follows:

24 feet (driveway width) / 3 feet (distance between each bottle) = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 40 seconds.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of packs Uncle Franky can make with the apples, we must first calculate the total number of apples he has. Since he ordered two boxes, and each box contains 40 apples, the total number of apples is 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples, given that each pack contains 8 apples. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 80 / 8 = 10.

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat, we must first calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased. 

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Given that Amor initially had $50, we can now calculate the remaining amount of money she has after purchasing the cheese. 

$50 (initial amount) - $40 (total cost of cheese) = $10

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine the time it would take for Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we must first calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn.

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000. Additionally, he lost $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000 in income by not working while in college. Therefore, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the total area of fabric Jim needs, we must first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed measures 6 feet in length and 8 feet in width. Therefore, the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet in length and 8 + 2 = 10 feet in width.

The area of one piece of fabric is calculated by multiplying its length by its width, which yields 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim requires two pieces, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To determine the total number of letters delivered by the post office from Monday to Wednesday, we must calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum those amounts.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. Therefore, 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday is 85 + 17 = 102. Consequently, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. Five more than twice as many as Tuesday is 204 + 5 = 209. Thus, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered by the post office from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"

"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we must first calculate their current heights. 

Xavier's height is initially 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches. After growing 3 inches, his height becomes 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole's height is initially 50 inches, and after growing 2 inches, his height becomes 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

Therefore, the difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 1 inch.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"In the context of a division of assets, it is essential to establish a clear and equitable distribution of funds among the parties involved. In this scenario, three individuals are dividing a total amount of $1920.

Let's denote the share of the first person as x. The second person's share is $80 more than the first, which can be expressed as x + 80. The third person's share is twice the amount taken by the second person, thus 2(x + 80).

To determine the share of the first person, we must consider the total amount and set up an equation to solve for x. The equation is as follows: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combining like terms, we have: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtracting 240 from both sides, we get: 4x = 1680.

Dividing both sides by 4, we find: x = 420.

Therefore, the share of the first person is $420.

"To determine the total hours worked by each painter, we must first calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is equivalent to 21 days.

Next, we need to convert the fraction of a day worked by the painters into hours. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day, we multiply this fraction by the total hours in a day, which is 24 hours. Therefore, 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

To find the total hours worked by each painter, we divide the total hours by the number of painters, which is 4. Therefore, 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

**The final answer is: 47.25**"
"To determine the number of tennis balls retrieved in the first set of the match, we must analyze the given information. 

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the number of tennis balls retrieved in the first set of the match is 10.

"To determine the value of the car in 2010, we must consider the depreciation rate of 21% per annum. This depreciation rate is applied to the initial value of the car, which was $20,000.

First, we calculate the depreciation for the year 2008:
$20,000 * 0.21 = $4,200
$20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Next, we calculate the depreciation for the year 2009:
$15,800 * 0.21 = $3,328
$15,800 - $3,328 = $12,472

Lastly, we calculate the depreciation for the year 2010:
$12,472 * 0.21 = $2,620.32
$12,472 - $2,620.32 = $8,851.68

"In the context of insurance, a premium increase of 60% is a significant adjustment. To determine the new monthly premium, we must first calculate the amount of the increase.

The normal monthly premium is $120. To find 60% of this amount, we multiply $120 by 0.6.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Adding this increase to the normal premium, we get the new monthly premium.

New monthly premium = $120 + $72 = $192

To find the annual premium, we multiply the new monthly premium by 12.

Annual premium = $192 * 12 = $2304

Therefore, James pays $2304 per year for his insurance."
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we must first calculate the total number of loads he does in a week. 

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds require 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed requires 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

"To determine the total number of stickers in Leo's collection, we must consider the stickers he had two years ago, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers in his collection. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers, bringing his total to 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
So, this year he has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 250 = 500 stickers.

Therefore, the total number of stickers in Leo's collection is 500.

"To determine the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we must first establish the total number of slices available. Since each pizza has 8 slices and there are 4 pizzas, the total number of slices is 8 * 4 = 32.

We are informed that Becky consumed 10 slices. Given this information, we can deduce that Jake ate 3 fewer slices than Becky, which equates to 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Furthermore, Silvia's consumption is directly related to Jake's, as she ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia consumed 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

To calculate the total number of slices eaten, we add the individual amounts consumed by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31.

Therefore, the total number of slices eaten is 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"In the context of a joint endeavor, such as preparing a meal, the time taken by each individual can be considered a contractual obligation. In this case, we have a situation where Betsy's time commitment is 18 minutes longer than Donovan's.

To determine the duration of Betsy's part, we must first establish the total time allocated for the task, which is 98 minutes. We can then express Donovan's time as 'x' and Betsy's time as 'x + 18'.

The total time equation can be represented as the sum of the individual times, which equals the total time allocated for the task. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Simplifying the equation, we combine like terms to get:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtracting 18 from both sides yields:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

x = 40

Since x represents Donovan's time, Betsy's time is x + 18, which equals 40 + 18 = 58.

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal preparation took 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"In the case of Hannah v. Doctor's Office, we must calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit to determine the amount owed. 

The cost of the cast is a fixed fee of $200. 

The doctor charges $300 per hour for a visit, but the visit was only 30 minutes. To calculate the cost of the visit, we must first determine the hourly rate for 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. Therefore, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is calculated by multiplying the number of pills by the cost per pill. In this case, Hannah was prescribed 30 painkillers at $4 per pill, resulting in a total cost of $120.

The cost of parking is a flat rate of $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours. Therefore, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we must add the costs of the cast, visit, painkillers, and parking together: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we must first calculate the number of emails he responds to on a daily basis.

James receives 80 emails per day. However, 20% of these emails do not require a response. To find the number of emails that do not require a response, we calculate 20% of 80, which is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails.

Consequently, James responds to the remaining emails, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

To find the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the daily number of responded emails by 5. Therefore, James responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

The final answer is: 320"
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we must calculate the cumulative total of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited the Science Center. 
On Tuesday, the number of classes doubled to 64.
On Wednesday, the number of classes tripled to 96.
On Thursday, an additional 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

To find the total number of classes, we add the classes from each day: 
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

However, the initial calculation was incorrect. Let's re-calculate the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

The correct total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To determine the average score of John's four tests, we must first calculate the total sum of his scores. The scores for the first three tests are identical at 100, and the fourth test yielded an 80.

The sum of the scores is calculated as follows: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

To find the average, we then divide the total sum by the number of tests, which is 4. 

The average score is therefore 380 / 4 = 95.

Therefore, the average score across the four tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we must first calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and consumed 70% of them. To find the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club, we multiply 20 by 0.7, which equals 14 pizzas.

The football team, on the other hand, ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They consumed 80% of these, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas.

In total, the glee club and the football team consumed 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

Therefore, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

**The final answer is: 14**"
"To determine the total cost of postage for the coupons, we must first calculate the cost of mailing the small and big coupons separately.

The number of small coupons is 700, and each costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The number of big coupons is twice the number of small coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of the small and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

Converting cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of postage for the coupons is $245.

The final answer is: $245"
"To determine the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained, we must first establish the initial number of meatball sub sandwiches ordered by Sidney. 

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

7 * 4 = 28

Mark then consumed 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Consequently, there were 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left. Sidney subsequently ordered 3 more sub sandwiches. 

3 + 3 = 6

Now, there are 6 meatball sub sandwiches left. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

6 * 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"In this scenario, we are dealing with a situation where a certain number of trucks, dispatched for delivery, were unable to fulfill their intended purpose due to mechanical failures. The key piece of information provided is that a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched were affected.

To determine the number of trucks that were unable to deliver the fertiliser, we must calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. This can be achieved by multiplying the total number of trucks by 1/4 or 0.25.

Total number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * 0.25
= 5

Consequently, the number of trucks that were able to reach the farmers is the difference between the total number of trucks dispatched and the number of trucks with mechanical failures.

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = Total number of trucks - Number of trucks with mechanical failures
= 20 - 5
= 15

Given that each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we can now calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers.

Total tons of fertiliser = Number of trucks that reached the farmers * Tons per truck
= 15 * 20
= 300

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 300 tons.

The final answer is: 300"
"To determine the cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter under the current promotion, we must first understand the terms of the promotion. The promotion offers a buy one pound of butter, get one half off deal. 

Given that the butter costs $4.00 per pound, we can calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter as follows:

For every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis pays $4.00 for one pound and $2.00 for the other pound, totaling $6.00. 

To purchase 6 pounds of butter, Dennis will need to buy 3 sets of 2 pounds. The total cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter is:
- 3 sets * $6.00 = $18.00

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter under the promotion is $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To determine the total cost of the party, we must first calculate the number of additional guests attending the event. Kayla invited her 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, totaling 45 individuals. However, 4 guests declined the invitation, leaving 41 attendees. Since the initial rental fee is for 20 guests, the number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost per additional guest is $6. Therefore, the total cost for the additional guests is 21 * 6 = $126. Adding the initial rental fee of $125, the total cost of the party is $126 + $125 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To determine the amount of money Maggie and Riza have left, we must first establish the initial amount of money each possessed. Since both individuals had $60, we can proceed with the calculation.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is equivalent to 1/4. Therefore, she has 3/4 of her money remaining. To calculate this, we multiply 3/4 by $60, resulting in $45.

Riza, on the other hand, spent one-third of her money, which is equivalent to 1/3. Consequently, she has 2/3 of her money remaining. To calculate this, we multiply 2/3 by $60, resulting in $40.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have: $45 + $40 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we must first establish the daily consumption of the first two monkeys. The first monkey consumes 10 bananas daily. The second monkey, being 4 bananas more than the first, consumes 14 bananas daily.

The total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. Since the total weekly consumption is 315 bananas, we divide this by 7 to find the daily consumption: 315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

To find the daily consumption of the third monkey, we subtract the consumption of the first two monkeys from the total daily consumption: 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

Therefore, the third monkey consumes 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we must first calculate the total number of pieces he completed. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 
Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 pieces. 
So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

Therefore, the correct answer is 750."
"To determine the amount of change Jenny receives, we must first calculate the total cost of the roses. Since she purchases 15 roses, it is more economical to buy 1 dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses. 

The cost of 1 dozen roses is $15. The cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6. Therefore, the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrives with 5 $5 bills, totaling 5 * $5 = $25. To find the change, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only provides change in quarters, we must convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we must calculate the revenue generated from each item and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each yields a total of 6 x $5.50 = $33.

Next, we calculate the revenue from burger platters: 9 platters at $11 each yields a total of 9 x $11 = $99.

Lastly, we calculate the revenue from sodas: 20 sodas at $1.50 each yields a total of 20 x $1.50 = $30.

To find the total revenue, we add the revenue from each item together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is $162."
"To determine the total time Paul will wait for his train, we must carefully analyze the given information and calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

First, we note that the first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes and will stay in the station for 20 minutes. This means the first train will leave the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

Next, the second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the second train will leave the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train is scheduled to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, it will also leave at 125 minutes.

Finally, the fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

To find the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to consider the time intervals between the trains. Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train, from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train, from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train, and from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of additional weeks Melanie needs to collect 200 toothpicks, we must first calculate the total number of toothpicks she has saved thus far. 

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie requires 200 toothpicks in total, and she already possesses 120, we must calculate the number of additional toothpicks she needs:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we must determine the number of weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect the required 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we must first establish the price at which Mr. Rogers purchased the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which equates to 0.75 when expressed as a decimal. Therefore, the price he paid is:
2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Subsequently, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which equates to 1.2 when expressed as a decimal. Thus, the price his friend paid is:
1500 * 1.2 = $1800

To calculate the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we subtract the price he paid from the original price:
2000 - 1800 = $200

To express this discount as a percentage, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
(200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we must first calculate the total number of seconds in the given time frame.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, and there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

Therefore, the correct answer is:

72000"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a mathematical problem that involves determining the score of Frankie, a party to a hypothetical bowling engagement. The facts of the case are as follows: Binkie, the other party, achieved a score of 90.

To determine Frankie's score, we must first calculate twice Binkie's score. This is a straightforward mathematical operation, which yields 2 * 90 = 180.

Next, we must consider the additional information provided, which states that Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score. This implies an increase of 15 points from the calculated score of 180. Therefore, we must add 15 to 180 to determine Frankie's final score.

Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 195"
"In this scenario, we have a situation where James embarked on a journey to the store, only to realize he had forgotten something at home, prompting him to return. To determine the total time James spent walking, we must first calculate the total distance he traveled.

The distance from James' home to the store is 4 miles. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back, we can calculate the total distance as follows: 4 miles (to the halfway point) + 4 miles (back home) = 8 miles.

Given that James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to cover this distance by dividing the total distance by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

Therefore, the total time James spent walking is 2 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by purchasing bananas in bunches instead of individually, we must first calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in both scenarios.

Jenny purchased 10 bunches of bananas, with each bunch containing 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas purchased is 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

If Jenny had purchased the bananas individually, the total cost would be 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

On the other hand, purchasing the bananas in bunches costs $3.00 per bunch, and since Jenny bought 10 bunches, the total cost would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by purchasing the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"In the context of a property dispute, the allocation of a shared fence between two parties can be a complex issue. However, in this scenario, we are dealing with a straightforward mathematical problem.

Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 60 = 100. Subtracting 60 from both sides yields 2x = 40. Dividing both sides by 2 results in x = 20.

Therefore, Sam is entitled to 20 feet of the fence.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the rate at which the crocodile grows, we must first establish the rate of growth per year. This can be calculated by dividing the total growth in inches by the number of years it took to achieve that growth.

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can calculate the total growth in 13 years by multiplying the growth per year by the number of years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine the total earnings from the sale of bicycles, we must first calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its respective price.

The total number of bikes sold is 300. Half of them were Trekking bikes, which is 300 / 2 = 150. Fifteen percent of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, which is 300 * 0.15 = 45. The remaining bikes were MTB, which is 300 - (150 + 45) = 105.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

To find the total earnings, we add up the earnings from each type of bike:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"In the context of this scenario, we have a situation where the farmer is producing a product (hay bales) and the truck is removing that product from the field. This is a classic example of a ""removal"" or ""diminution"" of a quantity.

To determine the number of hay bales left in the field, we must first calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer and then subtract the number of bales removed by the truck.

The farmer produces 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, resulting in a total of 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck removes 3 bales per hour and operates for 6 hours, resulting in a total of 3 * 6 = 18 bales removed.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales removed from the total number of bales produced: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, the correct answer is 12."
"To determine the total hours John spends learning per week, we must first calculate the total minutes he spends in class. 

John attends 6 periods per day, each lasting 40 minutes. Therefore, the total minutes spent in class per day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes. Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes spent in class per week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

In addition to his regular classes, John takes 2 extra classes, each lasting 40 minutes. Therefore, the total minutes spent in these extra classes per day is 2 * 40 = 80 minutes. Since he attends these extra classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes spent in these extra classes per week is 80 * 5 = 400 minutes.

The total minutes spent in both regular and extra classes per week is 1200 + 400 = 1600 minutes.

John also spends time learning on Saturday and Sunday. He dedicates 1/16 of his total weekly minutes to these days. The total minutes in a week is 7 * 24 * 60 = 1680 minutes. Therefore, 1/16 * 1680 = 105 minutes are spent on Saturday and Sunday. Since he spends this time on both days, the total minutes spent on these days is 105 * 2 = 210 minutes.

The total minutes spent learning per week is 1600 + 210 = 1810 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1810 / 60 = 30.17 hours.

The final answer is: 30.17"
"To determine the height of the bouncy ball on its second bounce, we must first establish the initial height from which it is dropped. Given that each story in the mall is 24 feet high and Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

Next, we must calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce. Since the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height, we multiply the initial height by 2/3. This yields 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

Finally, to find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we apply the same 2/3 bounce ratio to the height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height of the ball on its second bounce is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we must first establish the height of the first child in inches. Since the first child is 6 feet tall, and 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, the height of the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the total earnings of the apple orchard, we must first calculate the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Next, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

Therefore, the total earnings of the apple orchard for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag is $1000.

The final answer is: $1000"
"To determine the original weight of the triceratops, we must analyze the sequence of events. The Allosaurus consumed the last 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what the velociraptors had. 

Given that the Allosaurus ate half of the velociraptors' share, we can infer that the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.

Since the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex, the T-Rex must have consumed half of the original weight of the triceratops. Therefore, the T-Rex ate 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

As the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

Therefore, the original weight of the triceratops was 2160 kilograms.

**The final answer is: 2160**"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we must first calculate the total area of the walls. The north and south walls, each measuring 10 x 8 feet, have a combined area of 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls, each measuring 5 x 8 feet, have a combined area of 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. The total area of the room is therefore 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Given that a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons required to paint the room is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons. Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost of painting the room is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a probability problem. To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we must first establish the total number of cans remaining and the number of shaken cans.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken. She then took 1 unshaken soda for herself, resulting in 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas. Ellen's brother subsequently took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Given that there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken, the probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 14.29%.

**The final answer is: 14.29%**"
"In the context of a tort law scenario, the distance between two moving objects, such as trains, can be calculated by determining the individual distances each object has traveled and then summing those distances. 

To calculate the distance each train has traveled, we must first establish their respective speeds. The first train is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour. The second train, traveling in the opposite direction, is moving at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

Given that both trains have been in motion for 3 hours, we can calculate the distance each has traveled. The first train, traveling at 60 miles per hour, would have covered a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles. The second train, traveling at 30 miles per hour, would have covered a distance of 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

To determine the total distance between the two trains, we add the distances each has traveled: 180 miles (first train) + 90 miles (second train) = 270 miles.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 270 miles"
"To determine the total number of people Billy can help, we must first calculate the number of days he is available to volunteer. The period in question spans from March 1st to April 19th.

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. Therefore, the total number of days in this period is 31 + 19 = 50.

Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is equivalent to 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

To find the number of days Billy is available to volunteer, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days: 50 - 10 = 40.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, we multiply the number of days Billy is available to volunteer by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he can help: 40 * 6 = 240.

Therefore, the total number of people Billy can help is 240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we must first calculate the total number of individuals transported by the buses and the private cars. 

Each bus carried 35 people, and there were 12 buses. Therefore, the total number of people transported by the buses is 12 * 35 = 420.

Next, we calculate the total number of people transported by the private cars. Each car carried 3 people, and there were 20 private cars. Therefore, the total number of people transported by the private cars is 20 * 3 = 60.

Now, we add the number of people transported by the buses and the private cars to find the total number of people transported: 420 + 60 = 480.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can infer that the number of people inside the church is equal to the total number of people transported, as there is no information suggesting that any individuals were present outside the church.

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is 480.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine the age of Jeff, we must first establish the age of Martha, his younger sister. Since Martha is 4 years younger than her boyfriend, Mike, we can calculate her age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Given that Mike is 24 years old, we can deduce Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, considering the given information that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, we can calculate his age by adding 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

Therefore, the correct answer is 30."
"To determine the time difference between riding the biggest and the second biggest waterslides, we must first calculate the time it takes to ride each slide. 

For the biggest slide, the time is calculated by dividing its length by the speed at which people slide down: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.

For the second biggest slide, the time is calculated by dividing its length by the speed at which people slide down: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we must first calculate the total time spent per day. 

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.
The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, the total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the miles run by Ahito, we must first establish the distance covered by Micah. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance covered by Amber, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance by multiplying 8 by 3.5.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Next, we can calculate the combined distance covered by Amber and Micah, and then subtract this from the total distance to find Ahito's distance.

Total miles = 52
Amber's miles = 8
Micah's miles = 28
Combined miles of Amber and Micah = 8 + 28 = 36
Ahito's miles = Total miles - Combined miles of Amber and Micah
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we must first consider the initial charge and subsequent transactions.

The initial charge was $85.00. However, Sheila returned an item worth $15.00, resulting in a credit to her account. The new balance after the return is calculated as follows:

$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (return) = $70.00

Subsequently, Sheila made two new purchases: a frying pan and a set of towels. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off its original price of $20.00. To calculate the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00

The price of the frying pan after the discount is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The set of towels was on sale for 10% off its original price of $30.00. To calculate the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00

The price of the towels after the discount is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the new purchases is the sum of the prices of the frying pan and the towels:

$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

To find the new balance, we add the cost of the new purchases to the balance after the return:

$70.00 (balance after return) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

Therefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To determine the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we must first establish the relationship between the large and small jellyfish, as well as those that change color under UV light.

We know that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. This implies that two-thirds of the large jellyfish do not change color. Since the remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue, we can infer that the small jellyfish do not change color under UV light.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. The number of large jellyfish is x/5, and the number of small jellyfish is 4x/5 (since the remaining jellyfish are small).

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color. Since these jellyfish are a subset of the large jellyfish, we can set up the equation (x/5) * (1/3) = 6 to represent the number of large jellyfish that change color.

Solving for x, we get:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine Caroline's age, we must first establish the age of the other individuals involved. Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2.

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we have established Ben's age, we can determine Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3, as Caroline is three times older than Ben.

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for her retirement, we must first calculate the total amount she requires for her post-retirement living expenses. Given that she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000, her annual retirement income will be:

Annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

Since she intends to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

Total savings needed = Annual retirement income * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Next, we calculate the number of years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of 20% of her annual salary, which is $20,000 per year:

Number of years = Total savings needed / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save for her retirement.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the length of each final cut, we must first divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into. In this case, Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and must cut it into 4 equal parts. 

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Next, we must divide the result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into. Since each of the 4 parts must be divided into 5 equal parts, we divide 25 cm by 5.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of girls in the school, we must first establish the total student population. Given that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys, we can calculate the total number of students by dividing the number of boys by the decimal equivalent of 40%.

40% is equivalent to 0.4. Therefore, we divide 240 by 0.4 to find the total number of students: 240 / 0.4 = 600.

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must comprise the girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%, which is 0.6: 600 * 0.6 = 360.

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the total amount spent at the gardening shop, we must first calculate the total cost of the items purchased and then subtract the discount applied.

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. To find the total cost before the discount, we add these two amounts together.

Total cost before discount: $19 + $26 = $45

Next, we apply the coupon discount of $7 to the total cost before discount.

Total cost after discount: $45 - $7 = $38

Therefore, the total amount spent at the gardening shop is $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To determine the average height of heels at the cocktail party, we must first calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

There are 3 women wearing 4 inch heels and 3 women wearing 2 inch heels. 

The total height of the 4 inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2 inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height of heels, we divide the total height by the total number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

Therefore, the average height of heels at the cocktail party is 3 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the additional miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we must first establish the total number of days available for her to hike. June, being the month in question, has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which equates to a daily total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles.

To calculate the number of days required to complete 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the daily miles: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

However, Soledad only has 30 days available. To determine the total miles she can hike in this timeframe, we multiply the daily miles by the available days: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she aims to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find the additional miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the available days: 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

Therefore, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the total revenue the store will receive from selling all the balls, we must calculate the total amount generated from each type of ball and then sum those amounts.

First, we calculate the revenue from the red balls: 3 balls * $9 per ball = $27.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the blue balls: 11 balls * $5 per ball = $55.

Lastly, we calculate the revenue from the green balls: 25 balls * $3 per ball = $75.

Now, we add the revenues from each type of ball to find the total revenue: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

Therefore, the total revenue the store will receive from selling all the balls is $157.

The final answer is: $157"
"To determine the amount of apples James will have left, we must first calculate the portions taken by Pierre and Paul. 

Pierre's share is a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 
Paul's share is 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

The combined total taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

To find James' share, we subtract the total taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount: 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

Therefore, James will have 5 kg of apples left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the temperature in the morning, we must consider the changes in temperature. The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It then dropped by 8 degrees Celsius overnight. This means the temperature decreased to 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.

Following the temperature drop, the temperature increased by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. Therefore, we add 3 degrees Celsius to the temperature after the drop: -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius.

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-3}$"
"In the matter of Raymond's financial transactions, we have a clear sequence of events. Initially, Raymond possessed $21. Subsequently, he received an additional $11 from his allowance, thereby increasing his total to $32. Following this, he incurred two expenditures: $5 for a comic book and $19 for a puzzle.

To determine the current state of Raymond's finances, we must calculate the net effect of these transactions. The total amount spent is $5 + $19 = $24. Subtracting this from the total amount Raymond had after receiving his allowance, we arrive at $32 - $24 = $8.

Therefore, the correct answer is: $8"
"To determine the cost of each book, we must first calculate the total amount spent on the books. Anna initially had a budget of $16 and had already spent $4, leaving her with $16 - $4 = $12. After purchasing the two books, she was left with $2, indicating that she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can calculate the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2.

$10 / 2 = $5

Therefore, each book cost $5.

The final answer is: $5"

"To determine the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we must first calculate the distance of a round trip. 

The time it takes for John to drive to his parents is 2 hours, and his speed is 70 miles per hour. We can calculate the one-way distance using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time.

Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since the trip is a round trip, we must multiply the one-way distance by 2 to account for the return trip:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

However, John visits his parents twice a month. Therefore, we must multiply the total distance by 2 to account for the two trips:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

Therefore, the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents is 560 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we must first establish the total distance Sofie will cover during the same period. Given that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, her total distance in 7 days can be calculated as follows:

7 days * 10 miles/day = 70 miles

Since it is stipulated that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can infer that Brian's distance will be half of Sofie's total distance. Therefore, Brian's distance can be calculated as follows:

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we must first calculate the total number of toys produced by the four workers. Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, and two workers produce 4 toys per hour. 

The combined production rate of the first two workers is 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The combined production rate of the second two workers is 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
The combined production rate of all four workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour. 
In a 10-hour shift, the four workers produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 additional toys to fulfill the order, the total number of toys required is 400 + 20 = 420. 
The fifth worker must have produced the remaining 420 - 200 = 220 toys. 
Given that the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the production rate of the fifth worker per hour is 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we must first calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds. Adding Kory's dog to this total, we get 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds.

Therefore, the correct answer is 28."
"To determine the number of small bags John can make, we must first calculate the total number of M&M's he has. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiplying by the number of M&M's per ounce.

There are 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total number of ounces is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Next, we multiply the total number of ounces by the number of M&M's per ounce, which is 30. This yields 30 * 30 = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to determine how many small bags can be made from the total number of M&M's. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's. To find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we must first calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of the circumference is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Now, we need to calculate how many days it will take Alfie to cover this distance, given that he flies 400 kilometers every day. 

To do this, we divide the total distance (20,000 km) by the distance he flies per day (400 km).

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we must first establish the speed of the second-fastest car. Given that the average car can travel at 120 miles per hour, and the second-fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate its speed as follows:

Speed of the second-fastest car = 5 * 120 miles per hour = 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second-fastest car. Therefore, we can calculate its speed as follows:

Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 * 600 miles per hour = 750 miles per hour

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour.

"To determine the difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold, we must first establish the individual contributions of each person.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can say A = M.

We are informed that Camden and Sarah collectively painted 30 eggs, thus C + S = 30.

Furthermore, it is stated that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, which can be expressed as C = S + 12.

By substituting the second equation into the first, we obtain S + 12 + S = 30, simplifying to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides yields 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

With S known, we can determine C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, resulting in C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Given that A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can express the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can calculate the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

Therefore, the difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we must first calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

The total weight of the crayons can be calculated by multiplying the number of crayons by the weight of each crayon. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Next, we must determine the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 200 crayons, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total amount John makes from selling the planks, we must first calculate the number of logs he can create from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Next, we divide the total feet of usable wood by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, we multiply the number of logs by 5 to find the total number of planks.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

Now, we calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

Therefore, John makes $96 from selling the planks.

The final answer is: $96"
"To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we must first establish the individual earnings of each family member.

Valerie's monthly earnings are $5000. Her brother's earnings are 2 times her earnings, which equates to $10,000 per month. 

Their combined earnings are $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month. 

Their mother's earnings are twice their combined earnings, resulting in $30,000 per month.

To calculate the total amount of money the family has together, we add their individual earnings: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

Therefore, the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together is $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we must first establish her walking speeds on both the beach and the sidewalk. 

Let's assume her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Consequently, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute, as it is twice the rate of her beach speed.

Given that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and that 40 minutes are spent on the beach, we can establish the relationship between distance, speed, and time. The time spent on the beach is equal to the distance divided by the speed, which is 2/x = 40 minutes.

Solving for x, we find that x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute. This is her speed on the beach.

Consequently, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

To calculate the time spent on the sidewalk, we divide the distance by the speed: 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk is 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of additional weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60, we must first calculate the total amount she has saved thus far. 

Jane has been saving $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is $4/week * 8 weeks = $32.

Next, we must calculate the remaining amount she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since Jane continues to save $4 per week, we can determine the number of additional weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 additional weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total number of blue birds in the trees, we must first calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then sum those totals.

Three trees, each containing 7 blue birds, contribute a total of 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds to the overall count.

Two trees, each containing 4 blue birds, contribute a total of 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds to the overall count.

Lastly, a single tree with 3 blue birds contributes 3 blue birds to the overall count.

To find the total number of blue birds, we add the contributions from each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of marbles Bob has after losing 10, we must first establish the initial number of marbles he possesses. 

If receiving 2 dozen more marbles results in a total of 60 marbles, we can calculate the initial number of marbles by subtracting 2 dozen (24) from 60. This yields 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.

Now, we must consider the effect of losing 10 marbles. To find the final number of marbles, we subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles: 36 - 10 = 26.

Therefore, the correct answer is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"The scenario presented involves a unique application of thermodynamics and algebra. To determine the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water, we must consider the principles of heat transfer and the resulting average temperature of the mixed liquids.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. 

The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2, where x is the temperature of the second bottle.

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40.

Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 / 2 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 >= 80
165 + 5x >= 80
5x >= 80 - 165
5x >= -85
x >= -85 / 5
x >= -17

However, the temperature of a liquid cannot be negative. Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we must first calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

The final answer is: 700"
"To determine the cost of each single bagel, we must first calculate the total cost of the bagels after the 10% discount. 

The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

A 10% discount is applied to the total cost. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1. 
Discount = $40.00 * 0.1 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted cost.
Discounted cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Each pack contains 9 bagels, and Russell orders 4 packs. Therefore, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels.
Cost of each single bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

Therefore, the cost of each single bagel is $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To determine the number of potatoes Gomer consumed, we must first establish the relationship between scoops of mashed potatoes and the number of potatoes required to make them. It is stated that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

First, we calculate the number of potatoes required to make 1 less than 3 scoops. This is equivalent to 3 - 1 = 2 scoops. To find the number of potatoes needed for 2 scoops, we subtract 3 from 6, resulting in 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes per 2 scoops.

Now, we know Gomer consumed 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. Therefore, Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

To find the total number of potatoes consumed, we must determine how many groups of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops. This is calculated as 18 / 2 = 9. Since each group of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, the total number of potatoes consumed is 9 * 3 = 27.

Therefore, the correct answer is 27.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester requires for 60 days, we must first calculate the number of eggs he consumes in each 30-day period and then sum those totals.

In the initial 30-day period, Chester consumes 3 eggs per day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the subsequent 30-day period, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

The cumulative total of eggs consumed over the 60-day period is the sum of the eggs consumed in each 30-day period.
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

To convert the total number of eggs into dozens, we divide the total by 12, as 1 dozen equals 12 eggs.
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

Therefore, Chester requires 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans in the jar, we must first establish the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Next, we calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans by adding the number of green jellybeans to the number of red jellybeans: 17 + 34 = 51.

Now, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans in the jar is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim receives in a decade, we must first calculate the annual yield from his trees. With 5 trees, each producing 6 lemons per year, the total annual production is as follows:

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, to find the total number of lemons collected over a decade, we multiply the annual yield by 10, as a decade consists of 10 years.

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim receives in a decade is 300."
"To determine the number of women who remained on the bus, we must first establish the total number of women initially on the bus. Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can calculate the fraction of women as 9/14.

To find the number of women on the bus, we multiply this fraction by the total number of passengers: (9/14) * 84 = 54.

Now, we subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus: 54 - 20 = 34.

Therefore, the number of women who remained on the bus is 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the total number of sunflowers sold by Faraday, we must first calculate the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets and individual sunflowers separately.

Faraday sold 7 bouquets per day, with each bouquet containing 12 sunflowers. Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is 7 * 12 = 84.

Additionally, Faraday sold 13 individual sunflowers per day. 

To find the total number of sunflowers sold per day, we add the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets and individual sunflowers: 84 + 13 = 97.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days by multiplying the daily total by 3: 97 * 3 = 291.

Therefore, the total number of sunflowers sold by Faraday in 3 days is 291.

The final answer is: 291"
"To determine the financial loss incurred by Adam in his rock stand venture, we must first calculate the total cost of the rocks he purchases and the revenue generated from selling 60% of his inventory.

Adam invests $100 in the rock stand, and each rock costs $5. To find the total number of rocks he can purchase, we divide the total investment by the cost per rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, we calculate the number of rocks sold as follows:

60% of 20 rocks = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue generated from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

However, Adam also incurs the cost of the unsold rocks, which is 40% of the total rocks purchased:

40% of 20 rocks = 0.4 * 20 = 8 rocks

The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the sum of the cost of the rocks sold and the cost of the unsold rocks:

$100 (initial investment) + $40 (unsold rocks) = $140

To find the financial loss, we subtract the revenue from the total cost:

$140 - $84 = $56

Therefore, Adam incurs a financial loss of $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we must first calculate the time required to complete each type of picture scene.

For large-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 5 scenes per day. To find the number of days required to complete 45 large-sized scenes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes drawn per day: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days.

For medium-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 6 scenes per day. To find the number of days required to complete 36 medium-sized scenes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes drawn per day: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days.

For small-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 7 scenes per day. To find the number of days required to complete 49 small-sized scenes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes drawn per day: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days.

Considering the time required to complete each type of picture scene, we find that the maximum number of days is 9 days, which is the time required to complete the large-sized picture scenes.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 6 days
B) 7 days
C) 9 days
D) 10 days

Given that there are four children, we must now divide the total number of eggs by the number of children to find the individual allocation. This calculation is as follows:

36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

Therefore, each child receives 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May, we must first establish the daily expenditure. Since each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost is calculated as follows: 3 fish * $1 per fish = $3 per day.

Next, we must consider the number of days in May, which is 31. To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days: $3 per day * 31 days = $93.

Therefore, the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May is $93.

The final answer is: $93"
"In the matter of Patricia's rose collection, we have a straightforward transaction involving the transfer of ownership and acquisition of additional items. Initially, Patricia possessed 30 roses. She then relinquished 24 roses to her mother, resulting in a reduction of her rose collection.

The relevant calculation to determine the remaining roses is as follows:

30 (initial roses) - 24 (roses given away) = 6

Following this, Patricia acquired 15 additional roses, thereby increasing her collection.

6 (remaining roses) + 15 (new roses) = 21

Therefore, the current total of roses in Patricia's possession is 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the average speed at which Sid was traveling, we must first calculate the total distance he covered and the total time taken for the entire journey.

Sid traveled a total distance of 110 miles in the first segment and an additional 140 miles in the second segment, resulting in a total distance of 110 + 140 = 250 miles.

The total time taken for the journey is the sum of the time taken for each segment, which is 2 hours and 3 hours, respectively. Therefore, the total time is 2 + 3 = 5 hours.

To calculate the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

Therefore, the average speed at which Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"In the context of probability and the law, it's essential to understand the concept of independent events. When considering the probability of two events occurring, we must determine if they are independent or dependent. In this case, the outcome of one lottery ticket does not affect the outcome of the other, making them independent events.

Given that the first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning, we can express this as a decimal: 0.2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

Expressing this as a percentage, we get 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

**The final answer is: 12%**"
"In the matter of the seashell distribution dispute, we have three individuals: Carlos, Jim, and Carrey. The facts of the case are as follows:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than the number collected by Carlos.
2. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.

To determine the number of seashells each person collected, we must first establish the number of seashells collected by Carlos. Since Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, and Jim collected 27 seashells, we can infer that Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Next, we must determine the number of seashells collected by Carrey. Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, and Carlos collected 22 seashells, we can infer that Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now that we have established the number of seashells collected by each individual, we can calculate the total number of seashells: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

To determine the number of seashells each person will receive after dividing them equally, we divide the total number of seashells by 3: 60 / 3 = 20.

Therefore, each person will receive 20 seashells.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we must first calculate the number of carrots he consumes on weekdays and then add the number he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays, which comprise Monday through Friday. There are 5 weekdays in total. Therefore, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots.

On the weekend, Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots.

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend. This results in 20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots.

Therefore, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total time of the cassette, we must first calculate the length of the second song. The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6.

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

This means the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now that we have the lengths of both songs, we can calculate the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine the total profit earned by Linus, we must first calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus purchased 2 devices at $20 each, resulting in a total cost price of 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. Consequently, the total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus purchased 4 devices at $20 each, resulting in a total cost price of 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. Therefore, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we must first establish the height of the individuals involved. 

Isabel, being the tallest, stands at 7 feet. Ned, being two feet shorter than Isabel, would therefore be 5 feet tall. 

Given that Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows: 5 feet (Ned's height) + 1 foot = 6 feet (Carl's height).

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane can be calculated by dividing his height by 2: 6 feet (Carl's height) / 2 = 3 feet.

"To determine the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we must first establish the number of babies wearing purple and bows, and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Given that Carla has 8 babies, and 3/4 of them wear purple, we can calculate the number of purple-wearing babies as follows: 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Next, we find the number of babies wearing blue, which is 1/4 of the total: 1/4 * 8 = 2.

Now, we need to determine the number of babies wearing purple and bows. Since 1/3 of the purple-wearing babies also wear bows, we calculate this as 1/3 * 6 = 2.

We also know that 2 babies wear blue and bows. Therefore, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (purple and bows) + 2 (blue and bows) = 4.

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of purple-wearing babies with bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiply by 100: (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To determine the number of tax reports received by the IRS on Wednesday, we must first identify the total number of reports received on that day. 

The IRS received a total of 5168 tax reports last week. On Monday and Tuesday, they received 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday, they received 2136 reports. 

To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we can subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

Therefore, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday.

"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we must calculate the earnings from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land is $140.

"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we must first calculate the total number of eggs found by each individual.

Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy, being twice as successful as Lamar, finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie, who is less fortunate than Stacy, finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei, who is half as successful as Charlie, finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is the sum of the eggs found by each individual: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole initially hid 3 dozen eggs, we must convert this to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs initially hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9.

"To determine John's weekly earnings, we must first calculate the total number of apartments he collects from. The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, resulting in a combined total of 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% larger than this combined total.

To find 60% of 400, we multiply 0.6 by 400, which equals 240. Adding this to the combined total of the first two complexes gives us 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Therefore, the total number of apartments John collects from is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex, he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

Given that he is paid $0.40 per collection, his weekly earnings can be calculated by multiplying 3120 by 0.40, resulting in $1248.

Therefore, John's weekly earnings are $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To determine the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we must analyze the given information and calculate the production for each year.

The production of a 5-year-old tree is 50 fruits. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, resulting in 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

For the 8-year-old tree, we are informed that its production is 200 fruits less than that of a 10-year-old tree. However, we do not yet know the production of a 10-year-old tree. Let's denote the production of a 10-year-old tree as 'x'. Therefore, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.

The 9-year-old tree does not produce any fruits. A 10-year-old tree, on the other hand, produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can determine the production of a 10-year-old tree, which is 1000 fruits. Using this information, we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000, x = 1200. Therefore, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life, we add the production for each year: 50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 0 + 1000 = 1550.

The final answer is: 1550"
"In the context of this transaction, we are dealing with a gift of property, specifically money, from Sophia to Jack. To determine the amount of money Jack now possesses, we must first calculate the amount Sophia gifted to him.

Sophia's gift is 1/5 of her $100. To calculate this, we divide $100 by 5, which equals $20. This is the amount Sophia gifted to Jack.

Now, we must add this gift to Jack's initial $100 to determine his current total. $100 (initial amount) + $20 (gift) = $120.

Therefore, Jack now possesses $120."
"To determine the length of the red rope, we must first establish the relationships between the lengths of the three ropes. We are informed that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. We can express the relationship between the ropes as R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We also know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession, we must first establish the initial financial disparity between Ronnie and Rissa. Rissa was given three times the amount of money as Ronnie, who initially received $5. Consequently, Rissa was given $15.

Following the transfer of an equal amount of money to their younger sibling, we can establish the equation to determine the amount of money left in Rissa's possession. Let 'x' represent the amount of money given to the younger sibling. Therefore, Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

Given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount, we can set up the equation (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15. Solving for x, we find that (15 - x) = 12, which implies x = 3.

With the value of x established, we can now determine the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession: $5 - 3 = $2.

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"In the case of a wall mural with four distinct colors of paint – red, white, purple, and yellow – we are presented with a scenario where the quantities of red, white, and purple paint are equal. Furthermore, it is stipulated that half of the mural is comprised of yellow paint, while the remaining half consists of the aforementioned three colors.

Given that the total amount of paint utilized in the mural is 12 pints, we can deduce that the half of the mural not consisting of yellow paint is 6 pints. Since the quantities of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can represent the total amount of these three colors as 3x, where x is the quantity of each color.

Therefore, we can establish the equation 3x = 6, as the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 6 pints. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, yielding x = 2.

As a result, the quantity of red paint utilized in the mural is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total area of the house, we must first calculate the area of each component. 

The area of one bedroom is calculated by multiplying its length by its width: 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room's area is 5 times the area of one bedroom, which is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

Therefore, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3160}$"
"To determine the total number of clouds Alice counted over the course of the week, we must first establish the pattern of cloud count progression. It is stated that each day, Alice sees double the number of clouds as the day before. 

On Monday, Alice counts 3 clouds. 
On Tuesday, she counts 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counts 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

To find the total number of clouds, we must sum the counts for each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48.

Performing the calculation, we get: 3 + 6 = 9, 9 + 12 = 21, 21 + 24 = 45, 45 + 48 = 93.

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted over the course of the week is 93.

The final answer is: 93"
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $1, we must first calculate the total number of pods in the new box. The new box contains 20% more pods than the regular box, which has 100 pods. 

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. Therefore, the new box contains 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the new box costs $12 and each cycle requires one pod, we can calculate the total number of cycles that can be run with the new box for $12. This is 120 cycles.

To find the number of cycles that can be run for $1, we divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

10"
"To determine the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we must analyze the sequence of events.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This equates to 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

Subsequently, he loses 10 bills, resulting in 50 - 10 = 40 bills remaining.

Next, he utilizes half of the remaining bills to settle a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. Consequently, he retains 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his monetary holdings, effectively tripling the number of bills. Therefore, he now possesses 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Lastly, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Given that each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

Therefore, the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the soccer match, we must first establish the number of goals scored by each team in both the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which equates to 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, resulting in 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he must recycle the chalk, we must first calculate the amount of chalk remaining after Monday. On that day, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch piece of chalk, leaving 55% of the original length.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he must recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we must first calculate the total number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, which equates to 12 * (1/3) = 4 girls on varsity.
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, which equates to 12 * (1/4) = 3 boys on varsity.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

Consequently, the number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

Therefore, the correct answer is 17."
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny purchased, we must first establish the number of face masks Mike acquired. It is stated that Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we calculate three times the amount Mike purchased, which is 3 * 5 = 15 face masks.

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we must first calculate the total number of teeth the dentist treats. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth the dentist caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

To find the percentage, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, then multiply by 100. This gives us (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the correct answer is 50%."
"In the case of Mr. Marcellus vs. the Milk Company, we have a situation where a customer returns a portion of the goods purchased due to spoilage. To determine the amount of the refund, we must first calculate the quantity of milk that was returned.

The total amount of milk sold was 4000 gallons. However, 2/5 of this quantity was found to be past its expiration date and was returned to the company. 

To find the quantity of milk returned, we calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons of milk were returned.

As per the agreement, the customer is entitled to a refund for the returned goods. The cost per gallon is $3.5. Therefore, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.

Refund = 1600 * 3.5 = 5600

"To determine Colin's current age, we must analyze the given information and apply logical reasoning.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

Therefore, Colin's current age is 20 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can purchase for each school, we must first calculate the total number of books he can buy with the available funds. 

The total amount of money Bob has is $27,000, and he can purchase 100 books for $500. 

To find the total number of books, we divide the total amount of money by the cost per 100 books: $27,000 / $500 = 54 books.

Since Bob is distributing the funds to 3 schools, we must divide the total number of books by 3 to determine the number of books each school will receive.

Therefore, the number of books per school is 54 / 3 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"In the case of Newton v. The Apple Tree, we have a peculiar set of circumstances that require a thorough examination of the facts. 

Initially, two apples fell from the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. He then picked up the two apples, placing one in his pocket and throwing the other back into the tree. This action resulted in five additional apples falling from the tree. 

Newton then picked up these five apples, retaining all but one, which he threw back at the tree. This subsequent action led to six more apples falling from the tree. 

Considering the sequence of events, we can deduce the following:

- Initially, Newton had 2 apples.
- After picking up the 5 additional apples, he had 1 in his pocket and 5 outside, totaling 6 apples.
- After throwing the remaining apple and picking up the 6 new apples, he had a total of 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we must first calculate the number of 50 kg bags required to meet his needs. 

The total weight of coal ordered is 850 kg. To find the number of bags, we divide the total weight by the weight per bag: 850 kg / 50 kg = 17 bags.

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag, which is $18. Therefore, the total cost is 17 * $18 = $306.

The final answer is: $306"
"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will consume. 

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Therefore, Kate needs a total of 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To determine the time it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we must consider the rate at which he constructs and the rate at which they deteriorate.

Jay constructs 20 snowballs in a 60-minute period, which equates to a rate of 1/3 snowballs per minute. Conversely, 2 snowballs deteriorate every 15 minutes, resulting in a rate of 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To calculate the net rate of snowball construction, we subtract the deterioration rate from the construction rate: (1/3) - (2/15). To perform this subtraction, we find a common denominator, which is 15. This yields (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15. Simplifying this fraction, we get 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Given that Jay commences with 0 snowballs, we must calculate the time required to construct 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Time = Number of snowballs / Rate = 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 300"
"To determine Jim's current age, we must first establish John's age at the time the Digimon series was released, 20 years ago. Given that John is currently 28 years old, we can calculate his age at that time by subtracting 20 from his current age.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8 years old

Since John was twice as old as Jim at that time, we can determine Jim's age 20 years ago by dividing John's age by 2.

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2 = 4 years old

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago.

Jim's current age = 4 + 20 = 24 years old

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

"To determine the initial number of bandages, we must analyze the given information and create an equation to solve for the unknown variable.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. This means they had 50 bandages available for the second day.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. Therefore, they had 50 - 28 = 22 bandages left after the second day.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. So, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages available for the third day.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. To find the initial number of bandages, we need to consider the bandages used on the third day. Since they had 75 bandages available for the third day, they must have used 75 - 78 = -3 bandages. However, this is not possible, as they cannot use a negative number of bandages.

Let's re-examine the information. On the third day, they used half a pack of bandages, which is 25 bandages. This means they had 50 - 25 = 25 bandages left after the second day. They ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 100 bandages. Therefore, they had 25 + 100 = 125 bandages available for the third day.

Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, they must have used 125 - 78 = 47 bandages on the third day.

Now, let's create an equation to solve for the initial number of bandages. On the first day, they used 38 bandages. On the second day, they used 28 bandages. On the third day, they used 47 bandages. We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let x be the initial number of bandages. Then, the equation is:

x - 38 - 28 - 47 = 78

Combine like terms:
x - 113 = 78

Add 113 to both sides:
x = 191

The final answer is: 191"

The cost per inch of haircut is $30. Therefore, the cost for 2 inches is 2 * $30 = $60.

Additionally, the cost of the color is $40. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color: $60 + $40 = $100.

Therefore, the total cost of May's haircut and color is $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we must first calculate her regular pay and attendance bonus.

Jen's regular pay is calculated by multiplying her hourly rate by the total number of hours she works in April. Since she works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate the total number of hours she works as follows:

7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.

Next, we must calculate her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days.

Her attendance bonus is 24 days * $10/day = $240.

To find her total earnings, we add her regular pay and attendance bonus:

Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

Therefore, Jen's total earnings for April are $510.

The final answer is: $510"
"To determine the total amount Jason earned, we must calculate the earnings for each task and then sum them up.

Next, we multiply the blood volume of a single shark by the number of sharks to find the total blood volume: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of blood in ten sharks is 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To determine the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we must carefully analyze the sequence of events.

First, we note that 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. Subsequently, at 10:00, an additional 40 people entered. It is essential to recognize that these individuals ordered the same amount of food as the initial 50 people, but this information is irrelevant to calculating the total number of people who entered.

Next, we are informed that twice the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is 2 * 40 = 80 people.

Finally, by evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Given that 50 people entered in the morning, 3 times that number is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we must add the number of people who entered at each time: 50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (lunch) + 150 (evening) = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we must first establish the quantity of each type of pen. 

Alain's mom purchased 5 packs of red pens. Given that each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Furthermore, it is stated that Alain's mom acquired twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Consequently, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To calculate the total number of pens Alain has, we must aggregate the number of red pens and black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

Therefore, the total number of pens Alain has is 75.

The final answer is: 75"
"To determine the total amount spent by John, we must first calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles, which means the cost per bottle is $600 / 10 = $60.

The number of bottles of cognac is twice the number of bottles of scotch, which is 2 * 10 = 20 bottles.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

Therefore, the total amount spent by John is $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we must first calculate the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees separately and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 30
Lodgepole Pine: 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

"In the case of Fred v. The Root Beer Consumers, we have a situation where a quantity of root beer was prepared for a party, but was subject to various incidents of consumption and loss. To determine the amount of root beer available for each party attendee, we must calculate the total amount remaining after all incidents.

Initially, 24 gallons of root beer were prepared.

On the first day, 4 gallons were stolen by Fred's children, reducing the total to 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, further reducing the total to 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people attended the party and shared the remaining root beer equally. To find the amount each person received, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of attendees: 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons.

Therefore, the amount of root beer available for each party attendee is 2.67 gallons.

"To determine the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge, we must analyze the given information. The statement ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be translated into a mathematical equation.

Let x represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. The phrase ""four times the number of coffee mugs"" is equivalent to 4x. Adding eight to this expression yields 4x + 8.

We are informed that this expression equals 40. Therefore, we can set up the equation 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for x, we must isolate the variable. Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation yields 4x = 32. Dividing both sides by 4 results in x = 8.

Thus, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we must first calculate the number of fish with red stripes. One-third of the total fish have red stripes, which is calculated as follows:

Total fish = 66
Fish with red stripes = Total fish / 3 = 66 / 3 = 22

Next, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. This is calculated by subtracting the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

Fish without red stripes = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish, which represents the number of fish with blue stripes.

5/11 of 44 = (5/11) * 44 = 20

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish with blue stripes = 20
Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

Therefore, the total number of fish with red and blue stripes is 42.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we must first calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially possessed. Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, resulting in a total of 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

Additionally, Amy had three makeup sets, each containing six eyeshadow colors, totaling 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

Combining these, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

However, her sister stole one of the palettes, which contained 4 eyeshadow colors. Consequently, Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors, leaving her with 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Subsequently, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which contained 6 eyeshadow colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Therefore, after using up the eyeshadow colors from the makeup set, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we must first establish the total height of the two-story house. Given that the house is 7 times as high as Mattison, who is 60 inches tall, we can calculate the total height as follows:

7 * 60 = 420 inches

Next, we are informed that the floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

To find the height of the second floor, we subtract the first floor's height from the total height of the house:
420 - 180 = 240 inches

The height of the second floor is 240 inches. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house:
420 - 240 = 180 inches

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we must first calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas. 40% of the total 700 shells is found by team Alphas.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

The remaining shells are then 700 - 280 = 420 shells. Next, we calculate the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we can calculate the number of shells found by team Gogetters by subtracting the total shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

Therefore, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is 168.

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To determine the miles walked by the last dog, we must first calculate the total miles walked by all four dogs. Since the average miles walked per dog is 3, and there are 4 dogs, the total miles walked by all four dogs is 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Next, we need to find the miles walked by the first three dogs. The first dog walks 1 mile, the second dog walks 4 miles, and the third dog walks 3 miles. Therefore, the total miles walked by the first three dogs is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find the miles walked by the last dog, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs: 12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

Therefore, the last dog needs 4 miles."
"In the context of a mortgage, a homeowner may choose to borrow a significant portion of their property's value to address financial obligations. In this scenario, the homeowner's house is valued at $250,000. 

To determine the amount borrowed, we calculate 40% of the property's value.

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

The borrowed amount is then utilized to settle outstanding debts, with 60% of the borrowed sum being allocated for this purpose.

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To ascertain the remaining funds after debt settlement, we subtract the amount utilized from the borrowed sum.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

Therefore, the homeowner is left with $40,000 after settling his debts.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To determine the total earnings from selling the tunas, we must first calculate the total weight of the tunas caught by Deandre. 

The weight of the first tuna is 56 kilograms, the second tuna is 46 kilograms, and the last tuna is 26 kilograms. 

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Given that a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the cost per kilogram.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine Trinity's profit from selling magazines, we must first establish the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 
The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

Therefore, Trinity's profit from selling the magazines is $27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement, we must first calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.  Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day.  Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.  Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

The total amount of water removed is 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we must first calculate the total amount of the second medicine. Since the second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, and the first medicine is 14 mL, the second medicine is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Next, we calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose by adding the first and second medicine: 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we must first establish the capacity of each school. 

The capacity of Ali's class is 120 students. Since John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate the capacity of each of John's classes by dividing 120 by 8. 

120 / 8 = 15 students per class.

As John has two classes, the total capacity of his classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 
Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

"To determine the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we must first calculate the total interest he owes his sister. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, resulting in a total of 11 * 25 = $275 paid during this period.

The remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine the number of diapers Jordan changes per day, we must first calculate the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, so the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. This leaves the remaining half of the diapers for Jordan to change.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"In the context of this problem, we are dealing with a competition where an individual, Tim, is attempting to estimate the number of red jelly beans in a jar. The jar in question has a square base with dimensions of 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. 

To begin, we must calculate the total volume of the jar by multiplying its length, width, and height.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Given that the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we must account for this factor in our calculations. The actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Each jelly bean occupies a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. To determine the total number of jelly beans, we divide the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are informed that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To determine how far off Tim's estimate was, we must first establish what that estimate was. Since the problem does not provide this information, we will assume that Tim's estimate was 864, which is the calculated number of red jelly beans.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we must first establish the initial and subsequent passenger counts.

The bus departed with 20 people. At the first stop, 40 individuals boarded, increasing the total to 60. At the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 passengers who entered at the first stop boarded, which is 30 people. This brings the total to 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers doubled, resulting in a total of 180 individuals on the bus. To find the remaining capacity, we subtract the current number of passengers from the bus's total capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

Therefore, 20 people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we must first calculate the cost of visits for the initial 5-year period and the subsequent 3-year period.

For the initial 5-year period, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year at a cost of $2 per visit. Therefore, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. Over 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

Following the initial 5-year period, the cost of one visit increases by 150%. This results in a new cost of $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5 per visit. Consequently, the annual cost becomes 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

Combining the costs of both periods, we find that Pauline spent a total of $30 + $45 = $75 on all visits to the museum.

"In the case of Ian v. The Board, we have a dispute regarding the division of a 40-foot board. The plaintiff, Ian, has made a claim that the longer piece of the board is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.

To determine the length of the longer piece, we must first establish the length of the shorter piece. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 40

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 8

Now that we have determined the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can calculate the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs for his meatballs, we must first calculate the total pounds of ground beef required to produce 80 meatballs. Given that he yields 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the total pounds of meat needed by dividing the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now, we can calculate the total seasoning required by multiplying the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound. Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

The final answer is: 10"
"In the context of a contract or agreement, it is essential to understand the requirements for purchasing fabric for new curtains. In this scenario, we have a specific task at hand: determining the amount of fabric Luke should buy.

"In the case of Carly v. Cupcake Conundrum, we have a situation where the plaintiff, Carly, is preparing treats for her art class. The facts of the case indicate that she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. 

To determine the number of cupcakes made, we must first establish the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'x'. Consequently, the number of brownies would be 3x - 2.

Given that each of the 5 members of the class receives 2 treats, the total number of treats distributed is 10. This can be expressed as the sum of cupcakes and brownies: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Solving the equation, we get:
x + 3x - 2 = 10
4x - 2 = 10
4x = 12
x = 3

Therefore, the number of cupcakes made by Carly is 3.

"To determine the total cost of the services, we must first calculate the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure. The manicure starts at $35, and a 20% discount is applied. The discount amount is 0.2 * 35 = $7. Therefore, the discounted price of the manicure is $35 - $7 = $28.

Similarly, the pedicure starts at $40, and a 20% discount is applied. The discount amount is 0.2 * 40 = $8. Therefore, the discounted price of the pedicure is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. Since there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

Therefore, the total amount Karen would pay is $90.

The final answer is: $90"

"To determine the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples, we must first calculate the number of apples he had after eating 2/5 of them and giving his sister 25% of the remaining.

First, we calculate the number of apples Walter ate: 2/5 of 60 apples. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

Now, we find the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 apples. 

60 - 24 = 36

Next, we calculate the number of apples Walter gave to his sister, which is 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

Now, we find the number of apples remaining after Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

The amount of money he received = 27 * 3 = 81

"In this scenario, we have a straightforward mathematical problem that requires a step-by-step analysis to determine the initial number of grapes.

First, we know that Madeline consumed 6 grapes. Her brother then utilized 5 times the number of grapes she consumed to make a full glass, which equates to 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The combined total of grapes consumed by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes. This leaves us with the remaining grapes that their mother will use to make pies.

Each pie requires 12 grapes, and since their mother used all the remaining grapes to make 3 pies, the total number of grapes used for the pies is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.

To find the initial number of grapes, we must add the grapes consumed by Madeline and her brother to the grapes used by their mother. This gives us a total of 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 36 (by their mother) = 72 grapes.

However, this total only accounts for the grapes used, not the initial number of grapes. Since the mother used all the remaining grapes to make 3 pies, we can infer that the initial number of grapes must be greater than 72.

To find the initial number of grapes, we must consider the fact that the mother used all the remaining grapes to make 3 pies. This implies that the initial number of grapes minus the total number of grapes used (72) must be a multiple of 12, as each pie requires 12 grapes.

Given that the mother used all the remaining grapes to make 3 pies, the initial number of grapes must be a multiple of 12 plus 72. The smallest multiple of 12 that satisfies this condition is 12 * 7 = 84.

However, this is not the only possible solution. We can also consider the next multiple of 12, which is 12 * 8 = 96. This would also satisfy the condition, as 96 - 72 = 24, which is a multiple of 12.

Therefore, the possible initial number of grapes is either 84 or 96.

However, we can further refine this answer by considering the fact that the mother used all the remaining grapes to make 3 pies. This implies that the initial number of grapes minus the total number of grapes used (72) must be a multiple of 12 that is greater than or equal to 36 (the number of grapes used by the mother).

The only multiple of 12 that satisfies this condition is 12 * 8 = 96.

Therefore, the initial number of grapes is 96.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School on the day in question, we must first calculate the number of teachers who were not absent due to illness. This can be done by subtracting the number of teachers who were sick from the total number of teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of teachers sick = 13

Number of teachers not sick = Total number of teachers - Number of teachers sick
= 82 - 13
= 69

Next, we must consider the number of substitute teachers who were called in to help. These individuals are also counted as part of the total number of teachers present.

Number of substitute teachers = 9

Total number of teachers at school = Number of teachers not sick + Number of substitute teachers
= 69 + 9
= 78

Therefore, the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School on the day in question is 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year, we must first calculate the weekly cost of the ingredients. 

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. 
The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.
The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total weekly cost of the macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

Therefore, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To determine the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning classrooms, we must first calculate the total time available for cleaning and the total time required to clean all classrooms.

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task, and they work 8 hours a day. Therefore, the total time available for cleaning is 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

Next, we calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning classrooms is 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first calculate the capacity of each shelf. 

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase: 
Middle shelf 1 + Middle shelf 2 + Bottom shelf + Top shelf = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are needed to hold all of them. 
To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 
110 / 55 = 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is 2 bookcases.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Rose's profit, we must first calculate the total cost of the eggs and the total revenue from their sale.

The cost of the eggs can be calculated by multiplying the number of dozens purchased by the cost per dozen. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen, the total cost is:

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12

Given that there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose acquired a total of 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

To calculate the total revenue, we must determine the number of sets of 3 eggs that can be sold. This is achieved by dividing the total number of eggs by 3:

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since each set is sold for $1, the total revenue is:

20 sets * $1/set = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

Therefore, the profit Rose will make from selling the eggs is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the number of white hats, we must first calculate the number of red hats. Since half of the hats are red, we can calculate this as 100 * 0.5 = 50.

"To determine the cost of each stick of beef jerky, we must first calculate the discounted price of the bag. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it is discounted by $3.00. Therefore, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Converting the discounted price to cents, we get $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents.

Now, we can calculate the cost of each stick of jerky by dividing the total cost of the bag in cents by the number of sticks per bag. 

Number of sticks per bag: 30
Cost per bag in cents: 1500
Cost per stick: 1500 / 30 = 50 cents

Therefore, the cost of each stick of beef jerky is 50 cents.

"To determine the number of blueberry ice cubes Mary makes, we must first establish the relationship between the strawberry and blueberry cubes. It is stated that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. Therefore, B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes. This can be expressed as S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B into the equation, we get S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combining like terms, we have 6S - 4 = 116.

Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6S = 120.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find that S = 20.

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can calculate the number of blueberry cubes: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

"To determine the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we must consider the time it takes for each side. 

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each. 
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides: 
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To determine the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we must first calculate the number of calls he handles in a single day. 

Given that Tim spends 6 hours each day at work and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, we need to convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

To find the total number of calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5: 24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

Therefore, the correct answer is 120."
"To determine the additional time required for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish compared to the old varnish, we must first calculate the total drying time for each type of varnish.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. Therefore, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 minutes * 6 = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. Consequently, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 minutes * 6 = 72 minutes.

To find the difference in drying time, we subtract the time it takes for the old varnish to dry from the time it takes for the new varnish to dry: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

"In the matter of Phineas Frog's return home, we must consider the circumstances of his journey. Phineas is 200 yards away from his home, necessitating a return trip that involves both terrestrial and aquatic locomotion.

Given that half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we must calculate the time it takes to cover each segment of the journey. The land segment is 100 yards, and Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. Conversely, the water segment is also 100 yards, and Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute.

To determine the time required for the land segment, we divide the distance by the speed: 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.

Similarly, for the water segment, we divide the distance by the speed: 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

Therefore, the total time required for Phineas to return home is the sum of the times for each segment: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we must first establish the cost of each additional phone. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, we can set up an equation to find the cost of each additional phone.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as x. The main phone, being twice as expensive, would then be 2x. We are given that the main phone costs $20. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can calculate the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

Therefore, the total cost of the phone plan is $60.

The final answer is: $60"

"To determine the total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat, we must analyze the popping rate of the kernels over time. 

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 

In the subsequent 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to three times the initial amount, resulting in 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popping.

The rate then increased to four times the initial popping rate, leading to 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popping in the next 30 seconds.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, resulting in 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popping.

After the pan was removed from the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, which is 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

To find the total number of kernels that popped, we add the kernels from each interval: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210.

Therefore, Garrett has a total of 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

"To determine the number of lemons required for the lemonade, we must first calculate the total amount of lemonade to be prepared. Tim intends to make 4 gallons for the party and an additional gallon for his friend Allen, which is twice as tart.

The total number of gallons is 4 + 1 = 5 gallons.

Each gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice. Therefore, the total amount of lemon juice needed is 5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups.

The extra tart lemonade requires twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups. This means that the regular lemonade requires 5 - 2 = 3 cups of lemon juice.

To find the number of lemons needed for the regular lemonade, we divide the total cups of lemon juice required by the amount of juice yielded per lemon, which is 6 lemons per cup. Therefore, 3 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 3/6 * 6 = 3 lemons.

For the extra tart lemonade, we already know that it requires 2 cups of lemon juice. Therefore, the number of lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade is 2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons.

In total, Tim will need 3 lemons for the regular lemonade and 2 lemons for the extra tart lemonade.

"To determine the value of the boat after three years, we must consider the depreciation for each year. 

The initial value of the boat is $9000. In the first year, it depreciates by 30%, which is 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. Therefore, the value after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30% of its value after the first year, which is 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. Consequently, the value after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Lastly, in the third year, the boat depreciates by 20% of its value after the second year, which is 0.2 * $4410 = $882. Therefore, the value after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

To determine the number of marbles Darla received, we must first establish the initial amount of marbles Dallas possessed. It is stated that after dropping 4 marbles, Dallas has a total of 21 marbles. Therefore, we can calculate the initial amount of marbles Dallas had by adding the 4 marbles he dropped to the 21 marbles he currently possesses.

Dallas's initial marbles = 21 (current marbles) + 4 (dropped marbles) = 25 marbles

Now that we know Dallas received 25 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles Darla received by subtracting Dallas's initial marbles from the total number of marbles Mazie possessed.

Marbles Darla received = Total marbles - Dallas's initial marbles
= 52 - 25
= 27

Therefore, Darla received 27 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total amount paid by the family, we must first calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately.

"In the context of a motor vehicle, the force required to move it is directly related to its weight. Given that the car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and there are two children weighing 75 pounds each, we must calculate the total weight of the vehicle, its contents, and the children.

The total weight is calculated as follows:

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

To determine the force required to move the vehicle, we must consider that it is 1% of the total weight. This can be calculated as follows:

Force = 1% * 1600
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force required to move the vehicle is 16 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total amount of crepe paper James needs to buy, we must calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Given the dimensions of the backyard fence, we have a length of 20 feet and a width of 15 feet.

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

Therefore, James needs to purchase 70 feet of crepe paper."
"To determine the average age of Mia and Emma, we must first establish the age of Emma. Given that Mia is 40 years old and the age difference between the two is 16 years, it is clear that Emma is the older individual. Therefore, Emma's age is 40 + 16 = 56 years.

To calculate the average age, we add the ages of both individuals and divide by 2. The sum of their ages is 40 + 56 = 96. Dividing this sum by 2 yields 96 / 2 = 48.

Therefore, the average age of Mia and Emma is 48.

"To determine the total number of good seashells, we must first calculate the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, and then subtract the number of cracked seashells from this total.

The total number of seashells found is the sum of the individual counts: 214 (Tom) + 432 (Nancy) + 86 (Benny) = 732.

Next, we subtract the number of cracked seashells, which is 67, from the total number of seashells found.

Total good seashells = 732 - 67
Total good seashells = 665

Therefore, the total number of good seashells is 665.

The final answer is: 665"
"To determine the total cost of the place settings for Avery's holiday dinner, we must first calculate the cost of each type of plate and then multiply it by the number of people.

Dinner plates cost $6.00 each and Avery needs 12 plates, so the total cost of dinner plates is 6 * 12 = $72.

Bowls cost $5.00 each and Avery needs 12 bowls, so the total cost of bowls is 5 * 12 = $60.

Salad plates cost $4.00 each and Avery needs 12 salad plates, so the total cost of salad plates is 4 * 12 = $48.

The total cost of the place settings is the sum of the cost of dinner plates, bowls, and salad plates: 72 + 60 + 48 = $180.

Therefore, the total cost of the place settings for Avery's holiday dinner is $180.

"To determine the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs, we must first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party.

The number of guests invited is 20, and each guest will consume 2 hot dogs. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs required is 20 * 2 = 40.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. To find the total number of hot dogs he needs to purchase, we subtract the leftover hot dogs from the total required:
40 - 4 = 36

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we must determine the number of packs John needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:
36 / 6 = 6

Given that John needs 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, we calculate the total amount he needs to spend:
6 * 2 = 12

Therefore, the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is $12.

The final answer is: $12"

"In the context of Mamou's charitable efforts, we must calculate the remaining meals she has to distribute to the affected families. To do so, we need to determine the total number of meals she has already provided and subtract that from the total number of meals she initially had.

Mamou distributed 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. To find the total number of meals given out, we add these amounts together:

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48
Total meals given out = 142

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the initial total to find the remaining meals:

Total meals Mamou has = 1,360
Meals left to distribute = Total meals Mamou has - Total meals given out
Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142
Meals left to distribute = 1,218

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute to the affected families.

"To determine the total age of the siblings, we must first establish the ages of each individual. 

Given that one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the older brother's age by doubling the age of the younger brother. Therefore, the older brother is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

The three sisters are all the same age, which is 16 years old. To find the total age of the sisters, we multiply their age by the number of sisters: 16 * 3 = 48 years.

Next, we calculate the total age of the brothers by adding their ages: 12 + 24 = 36 years.

Finally, we determine the total age of all the siblings by adding the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters: 48 + 36 = 84 years.

Therefore, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we must first calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

Meditation time per day consists of two sessions: one in the morning and one before sleep. Each session is 15 minutes long. Therefore, the total daily meditation time is 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes.

Since Charisma meditates 7 days a week, the total weekly meditation time is 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

Yoga time per day is 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. Since Charisma practices yoga 5 days a week, the total weekly yoga time is 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week, we add the weekly meditation time and yoga time together: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week.

In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga is 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

Therefore, the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2040}$"
"In the context of this matter, we are tasked with determining the total square footage of fabric required for the quilt. To accomplish this, we must first calculate the total square footage contributed by each type of t-shirt.

Small t-shirts, measuring 3 square feet each, contribute a total of 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet to the quilt.

Medium t-shirts, measuring 4 square feet each, contribute a total of 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet to the quilt.

Large t-shirts, measuring 6 square feet each, contribute a total of 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet to the quilt.

To determine the total square footage of the quilt, we must sum the contributions from each type of t-shirt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

Therefore, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet.

"In the context of a retail transaction, a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts implies that the customer pays full price for the first item and 50% of the price for the second item. Given that the original price of each T-shirt is $8, the total cost of the T-shirts can be calculated as follows:

For the first T-shirt, the customer pays the full price: $8.
For the second T-shirt, the customer pays 50% of the price: $8 * 0.5 = $4.
The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, we consider the purchase of a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price of $40. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

To determine the total amount of money spent at the store, we add the cost of the T-shirts to the cost of the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the number of movie tickets Ryan can purchase, we must first calculate his total earnings from completing his chores and then subtract the expenses incurred for the ice cream cones.

Ryan's weekly allowance for completing chores is $6. He completed his chores for 3 weeks, resulting in a total allowance of $6 * 3 = $18.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Each cone costs $1.25, and Ryan purchased 4 cones, totaling $1.25 * 4 = $5.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to determine his remaining funds: $18 - $5 = $13.

"To determine the number of weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we must first calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog. 

The dog digs six holes a day, and Nate is on vacation for 14 days. Therefore, the total number of holes dug during this period is 6 * 14 = 84.

However, the dog continues to dig six new holes every night, so we must account for these additional holes. Since Nate fills the holes for the same number of days he was on vacation, we can add the additional holes to the total.

The dog digs 6 new holes every night for 14 days, resulting in 6 * 14 = 84 additional holes. Therefore, the total number of holes is 84 + 84 = 168.

Now, we must calculate the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, resulting in a net of 3 holes filled per day.

To find the number of days, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day: 168 / 3 = 56.

Finally, to determine the number of weeks, we divide the total number of days by 7: 56 / 7 = 8.

Therefore, the correct answer is 8 weeks.

"In this case, we have a situation where Igor, the assistant, has gathered an assortment of laboratory equipment, including test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes. The total number of items he gathered is 29, but we need to determine how many beakers he lost.

Let's start by analyzing the information provided. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. Additionally, he gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested. However, this statement seems to be inconsistent with the information that he gathered half as many test tubes as requested. Therefore, we can infer that Igor gathered 2 more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested, which means he gathered 14 - 2 = 12 Petri dishes.

We know that Igor had the correct number of beakers, which is 7. Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 12 Petri dishes = 27 items.

Since Igor had 29 items on the lab bench, he must have lost 29 - 27 = 2 beakers.

"In the context of a relay race, the speed and distance covered by each participant are crucial factors in determining the time taken to complete their respective parts of the race. Given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can establish a relationship between their speeds.

Let's denote the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile as 'A' minutes. Consequently, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's, which means it takes her 2A minutes to cover the same distance.

Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, and we know she covered 4 miles, we can infer that Aaron covered half the distance, which is 2 miles. Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can establish the equation:

A * 2 = 16

Solving for A, we get:
A = 16 / 2
A = 8

Now that we know Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, we can determine the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile:
Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2A = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to purchase, we must first calculate the total amount of line required for the existing dock. The caretaker desires 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. 

Given that the dock is 200 feet in length, we multiply the length of the dock by 3 to find the total amount of line needed: 
200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already possesses 6 feet of new line. To find the total amount of line he needs to purchase, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required: 
600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker must acquire 594 feet of line.

The final answer is: $\boxed{594}$"
"To determine the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we must first calculate their daily revenue. 

Each reservation consists of 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. Therefore, the total revenue per reservation is (2 * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15.

Since Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, their daily revenue is 6 * $15 = $90.

Given that they are open 2 days a week, their weekly revenue is $90 * 2 = $180.

Therefore, the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant is $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we must first calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of all 50 watermelons. Given that the vendor sold all of them at a 25% profit, we can infer that the selling price is 125% of the cost price.

The cost price of the 50 watermelons is $80. To find the cost price of one watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

Now, we calculate the selling price of one watermelon by determining the total revenue from the sale of all 50 watermelons. Since the selling price is 125% of the cost price, we multiply the cost price of 50 watermelons by 1.25:

Selling price of 50 watermelons = 1.25 * $80 = $100
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

Therefore, the selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we must first establish the current age of James, John's son. We are informed that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This implies that Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Given that James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

However, we are also given that John had James when he was 19. This information is crucial in determining the age of John's youngest son. Since James is 18 years old now, John must have had James 18 years after he was 19, which would make John 37 years old at that time.

Now, we know that John was 32 when his youngest son was born. Therefore, the time that has passed since then is 37 - 32 = 5 years. In 3 years, his youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the disparity in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after a 60-minute period, we must first establish their respective peeling rates. 

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, thus in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, thus in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

Therefore, the correct answer is 5."
"To determine the total cost incurred by Mark for the new radiator and its installation, we must first calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. 

The original cost of the radiator is $400. 
The discount is 80% off, so the discount amount is 400 * 0.8 = $320.
The cost of the radiator after the discount is 400 - 320 = $80.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. 
The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * 50 = $150.

The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost, which is 80 + 150 = $230.

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230 for the new radiator and its installation.

The final answer is: $230"
"To determine the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm, we must consider the total number of animals and the total number of legs. The total number of animals is 20, and the total number of legs is 70.

Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of legs: 2C + 4W = 70.

We also know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can set up another equation: C + W = 20.

To solve for C, we can first solve the second equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the first equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

Therefore, the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"In the context of this scenario, we are dealing with a simple division problem to determine the equitable distribution of pizza slices among the individuals involved. 

To begin, we must calculate the total number of slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Next, we must identify the number of individuals who will be sharing the pizzas. In this case, there are 4 people: Henry and his 3 friends.

To ensure an equal distribution of slices, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.

The final answer is: 14"
