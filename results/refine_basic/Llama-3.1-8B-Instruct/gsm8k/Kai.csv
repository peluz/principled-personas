"Let's break down Janet's daily egg sales. She lays 16 eggs per day. For breakfast, she eats 3 eggs, and she bakes 4 eggs for her friends. 

The total number of eggs used is 3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs Janet has left: 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.

Janet sells these remaining 9 eggs at $2 each. To find out her daily earnings, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we have:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question. So, Josh decides to try flipping a house. He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs.

Let's calculate the new value of the house: 
New value = Original value + (Original value * 150%)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"Hey, let's break down James' running routine. He does 3 sprints 3 times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters long. To find the total meters he runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

First, let's find the total meters he runs in one session. Since he runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Now, we know James runs 3 times a week, so we multiply the total meters he runs in one session by the number of sessions:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon. 

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"I'd be happy to help Kylar figure out how much he needs to pay for the glasses. 

Let's break it down. The first glass costs $5. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 

Since the price decreases by 40% each time, we can find the cost of the remaining glasses by multiplying the previous cost by 0.6. 

The cost of the first glass is $5, the second is $3, the third is $1.8, the fourth is $1.08, the fifth is $0.64, the sixth is $0.384, the seventh is $0.2304, the eighth is $0.13824, the ninth is $0.082944, the tenth is $0.0497664, the eleventh is $0.02986584, the twelfth is $0.017949504, the thirteenth is $0.0107949304, the fourteenth is $0.00648696024, the fifteenth is $0.003876582144, the sixteenth is $0.0023259456896.

Now, let's add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.0107949304 + $0.00648696024 + $0.003876582144 + $0.0023259456896 = $23.016

Kylar needs to pay $23.016 for the glasses."
"Let's break down the information given:

Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute. To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Next, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down John's trip into segments to find out how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't travel any distance during this time.

Next, John drives at a speed of 30 mph for half an hour. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

After that, John drives at a speed of 80 mph for the remaining 2 hours. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Now, let's add up the distances John traveled in the return trip:

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 160 = 175 miles

Since John is now back home, we need to find the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours. To do this, we need to consider the distance he has traveled in the 4 hours. 

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles

Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

However, this is the total distance he traveled, not the distance from home. To find the distance from home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled in the first 3 hours from the total distance traveled in 4 hours. 

Distance from home = Total distance traveled in 4 hours - Distance traveled in the first 3 hours
Distance from home = 355 - 180
Distance from home = 175 miles"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 * $10 = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 0.3 by 180, which equals 54. So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"Let's break down the cost of the pastries Toula bought. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the donuts. Since she bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, the total cost of the donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. She bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen, so the total cost of the cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.

Lastly, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. She bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen, so the total cost of the cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the lemon tree costs $90 to plant, and it generates revenue by producing 7 lemons per year, which can be sold for $1.5 each. The annual maintenance cost is $3.

First, we calculate the revenue generated by the tree each year: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year.

Next, we subtract the annual maintenance cost from the revenue to find the net revenue: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tree to pay for itself. To do this, we divide the initial cost by the net revenue: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

However, this calculation tells us when the tree will pay for itself, but we want to know when it starts earning money. Since the tree generates revenue in the first year, we can conclude that it starts earning money in the first year.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with ""x"". So, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

After selling at the green house, she had (x - x/3) = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners left.

She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

After selling at the red house, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2x/3 - 2) is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = (x/3 - 1).

So, she had (2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1)) = (x/3 - 1) vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a dance class with 20 students. First, 20% of them enrolled in contemporary dance. To find out how many students that is, we multiply 20 by 0.2.

20 * 0.2 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students to find out how many are left.

20 - 4 = 16 students

Next, 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. To find out how many students that is, we multiply 16 by 0.25.

16 * 0.25 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many enrolled in hip-hop dance.

16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the best purchase option for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each item.

The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, so the increase in value for the $5,000 jewelry is 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * $5,000 = $125.

The electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%, so the increase in value for the $8,000 electronic gadgets is 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Since the jewelry has a higher potential increase in value, the merchant should choose the jewelry.

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125.

The final answer is: $125"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question.

So, we have two trains that leave San Rafael at the same time. They travel westward for 80 miles on the first day, and then they head northward for 150 miles on the second day. We need to find the total distance covered by each train over the two days.

To solve this, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which helps us find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle. In this case, the two legs of the triangle are the distances traveled on the first and second days.

Let's calculate the total distance:

Total distance = √(80^2 + 150^2)
Total distance = √(6400 + 22500)
Total distance = √28900
Total distance = 170 miles

Since both trains travel the same distance, the distance covered by each train is 170 miles.

The final answer is: 170"
"Let's break down Jill's annual salary. 

First, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching. She gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked to get the total hours worked per year: 35 * 50 = 1750 hours. Then, we multiply the total hours worked per year by her hourly wage: 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Next, we calculate her earnings from coaching. She gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Again, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked to get the total hours worked per year: 15 * 50 = 750 hours. Then, we multiply the total hours worked per year by her hourly wage: 750 * $30 = $22,500.

Now, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching to get her total annual salary: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"Hey there, let's break down Claire's egg consumption. She makes a 3-egg omelet every morning for breakfast. To find out how many dozens of eggs she'll eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks and multiply it by the number of eggs she eats per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Claire eats 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail and she's already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire hike. To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining distance, we need to figure out how much time she has left.

Since she wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike, we can find the total time she needs to complete the hike by dividing the total distance by her desired average speed:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

She's already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, so she has 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 10 liters of orange drink that is two-thirds water. To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Next, we have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling. The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

However, we spill 1 liter of the orange drink. To find the remaining amount of water, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water. The remaining amount of water is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Since we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange and pineapple drinks. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Samantha is 31 years old, and Raymond was born 6 years before her. This means Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

We also know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to find the difference between Raymond's current age and the age when he had a son.

The difference between Raymond's current age (25) and the age when he had a son (23) is 25 - 23 = 2 years.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

Next, the next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they buy a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold. 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"Let's break down the problem. We're dealing with a candle that melts at a rate of 2 centimeters every hour. We want to find out how much shorter it will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

First, we need to determine the total time the candle burns. Since it burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, that's a total of 4 hours.

Now, we multiply the rate at which the candle melts (2 centimeters per hour) by the total time it burns (4 hours).

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"I'd be happy to help you figure out the original price of the book. 

Let's say the original price of the book is 'x'. Since it was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that cost $3 each, and 4 apples that cost $1.50 each. We need to find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, given that each box costs $8.50 and she paid a total of $50.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples. The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 = $15, and the cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Now, we need to find the cost of the pizza boxes. Since Marie paid a total of $50, we subtract the cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount she paid: $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box to find the number of boxes: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Mishka's shopping spree. She bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. 

One pair of shorts costs $16.50, so 3 pairs will be 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.
One pair of pants costs $22.50, so 3 pairs will be 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.
One pair of shoes costs $42, so 3 pairs will be 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, and she buys cartons with 15 servings of ice cream per carton at a cost of $4.00 per carton. We need to figure out how much she'll spend on ice cream after 60 days.

To do this, we need to find out how many cartons she'll need. Since she eats one serving per night, she'll need 60 cartons for 60 nights. Each carton has 15 servings, so we divide 60 by 15 to find the total number of cartons:
60 / 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream. Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question. So, Gloria is shoe shopping and has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much.

Let's break this down. If one pair of heels costs $33, then the other pair costs 2 * 33 = $66. Now, we know that the total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. Since the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots, we can set up an equation: B = 99 + 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 104.

The final answer is: $104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out how many jelly beans are in the jar. Let's break it down.

The first friend thinks there are 80 jelly beans in the jar. The second friend thinks there are 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. To find that, we need to divide 80 by 2, which is 40, and then add 20 to that. So, the second friend thinks there are 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.

The third friend thinks there are 25% more than the first friend's guess. To find that, we need to multiply 80 by 0.25, which is 20, and then add 20 to 80. So, the third friend thinks there are 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. There are three friends, so we need to divide the total by 3 to find the average. 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. To find out how many hours he spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 7.

First, let's find the total time spent per day. We can do this by multiplying the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog.

Number of dogs: 10
Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Total time per day = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Total time per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Now, we need to multiply the total time per day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We can write an equation based on the given information: G = S + 30.

We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can write another equation: S + G = 110.

Now, we can substitute G = S + 30 into the second equation: S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the information given about the jewels.

Raymond has 40 jewels. To find out how many jewels Aaron has, we need to calculate half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5 to that number. Half of 40 is 20, and 20 + 5 is 25. So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total. 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Hey, let's break down Mike's ping pong game. He played for 40 minutes, which is divided into two 20-minute segments. 

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 

Now, let's calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. He scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which equals 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"Hey there, let's break down Terry's yogurt expenses. He eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Since each set costs $5.00, Terry spends 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out how many Lego sets John has left.

John sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so let's calculate how much money he made from selling them:
13 * 15 = 195 dollars

He then bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

John also had $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he spent is:
195 - 5 = 190 dollars

Now, let's find out how much money John used from his own money to buy the video games:
190 - 5 = 185 dollars

Since he used his own money to buy the video games, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $185.
185 / 15 = 12.33 (round down to 12 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 12 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 1 set with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 12 = 1 Lego set left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down John's running routine. He runs 60 miles a week, which is spread across 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. For the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, so that's 1.5 hours each day.

To find out his total running time, we add up the hours from each day: 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours. Since he runs 3 days a week, we multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time: 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours.

Now, to find out how fast John runs, we divide the total distance by the total time: 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to determine her walking and running speeds. We know she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half of her running speed. So, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends walking and running. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time she spends walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours, and the time she spends running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit it with the gold javelin, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

The original distance Polly can throw the javelin is 400 feet. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther than that.

Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"Let's break down the problem. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie: 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

Now, we know that there were 14 pieces of pie remaining at the end of the evening. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces.

The final answer is: 26"
"Hey there, let's break down your question. You want to know how many grams of chips you can eat from a 300g bag. The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you've already consumed 1800 calories.

First, let's figure out how many calories you can still consume: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Now, let's see how many servings you can have with those remaining calories: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since the bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can still have by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles, and for every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 candles. The cost of one pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. If he sells each candle for $2.00, we need to find his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Since Charlie sells each candle for $2.00 and he makes and sells 20 candles, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to find the total cost. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is:

Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $10.00 per pound * 2
Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $20.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"Hey there, let's break down Meredith's writing schedule. She's a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits articles to clients daily. 

First, we need to figure out how many articles she wrote each day. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we calculate 2/5 of 5, which is 2. Then, we add this to the original number of articles, which is 5. So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by the time it takes to write one article: 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She then purchased a package of Post-it notes and used 220 of them at work. After that, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to figure out how many Post-it notes she had after buying the package and before using any at work. We can do this by adding the initial Post-it notes and the ones in the package, then subtracting the ones she used at work and the ones she had left over.

Let's call the number of Post-it notes in the package 'x'. The equation would be:

80 + x - 220 + 23 = total Post-it notes after purchasing the package

Simplifying the equation:
80 + x - 220 + 23 = 80 + x - 197
x - 197 = 80 + x - 197
x = 80

However, this doesn't make sense because x should be greater than 80 since she purchased a package of Post-it notes. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

The correct equation should be:
80 + x - 220 + 23 = total Post-it notes after purchasing the package

Simplifying the equation:
80 + x - 197 = 80 + x - 197

First, we know John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per tie: 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. We know the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

The total cost of red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

To find the total amount spent on ties, we add the cost of blue ties and red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Tracy used a piece of wire that's 4 feet long to support her tomato plants. We need to figure out how many pieces she got after cutting it into 6-inch long pieces.

First, let's convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 4 feet by 12 to get the total length in inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy got.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. There are 15 floors and 8 units per floor, so the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: 120 units * 1/4 = 30 units.

The final answer is: 30"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Lloyd has an egg farm with chickens that produce 252 eggs per day. He sells them for $2 per dozen. To find out how much he makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens are produced per week:
1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"Let's break down Tom's journey. He travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is a 3-hour period. Since his ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, the distance covered during this time is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

Now, let's calculate the time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour. It's simply 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

For the return trip, the distance remains the same, 30 miles. However, his ship's speed is now 6 mph. To find the time taken for the return trip, we divide the distance by the speed: 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, the total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours (one way) + 5 hours (return trip) = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, and he removes 30 of them. To find the total weight of the comic books, we multiply the weight of one comic book by the number of comic books: 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can calculate the number of toys by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy. The remaining weight is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. So, we divide 7.5 by 0.5 to get the number of toys: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the revenue earned from repairing truck tires and car tires on Thursday. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire.

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Next, we need to calculate the revenue earned from repairing car tires on Friday. Since no truck tires were repaired, we only need to consider the car tires.

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"So, the Doubtfire sisters are driving home with 7 kittens they adopted from the local animal shelter. Their mom calls to tell them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have just had kittens. It turns out Patchy has had three times as many kittens as the ones they adopted, and Trixie has had 12.

Let's calculate the total number of kittens. The Doubtfire sisters already have 7 adopted kittens. Since Patchy has had three times as many kittens as the ones they adopted, that's 3 * 7 = 21 kittens from Patchy. And Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Now, let's add them all up: 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Jean has 30 lollipops and eats 2 of them. Now, Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag. To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to subtract the number of lollipops Jean ate from the total number of lollipops and then divide the result by 2.

First, let's subtract the number of lollipops Jean ate from the total number of lollipops:
30 - 2 = 28

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags Jean can fill:
28 / 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with 2 lollipops in each bag.

The final answer is: 14"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Peter's planning to hit the movies this week. He's got a budget of $42 for the week. Each trip to the movies costs $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn, making it a total of $14 per trip.

To figure out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to divide his total budget by the cost of one trip. Let's do that:

42 ÷ 14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit, then divide the result by the weight of each box.

Weight limit of the bridge: 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck: 3755 pounds
Weight of each box: 15 pounds

Maximum weight allowed on the truck: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, let's calculate the 25% fee on the final bill. This is done by multiplying the final bill by 0.25. 
   25% of $40.00 = 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

Next, we add the 25% fee to the final bill:
   $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Then, we add the delivery fee:
   $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the tip:
   $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."

The final answer is: 187"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know there are 25 oranges in total. Out of these, 1 is bad and 20% are unripe. 

First, let's find 20% of 25. To do this, we multiply 25 by 0.2 (which is the decimal form of 20%). 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Now, we know there are 1 bad and 5 unripe oranges. So, the total number of oranges that are not good is 1 + 5 = 6.

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges. 
25 (total) - 6 (not good) = 19 oranges are good.

The final answer is: 19"

"Let's break down Marcy's pension situation. She works for 30 years, but she only gets the full pension for the first 20 years. After that, she gets 5% of the value of the pension for the remaining 10 years.

The full pension for 20 years is 20 years * $50,000/year = $1,000,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension, which is 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000/year.

So, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000/year for the first 20 years and $50,000/year for the remaining 10 years. However, since the question asks for the annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the 10 years of 5% pension. 

The annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000/year.

The final answer is: $50,000."
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, and the second half of the year is also 6 months. 

The initial amount charged per month is $140. 

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount, which is 90% of the initial amount. 
90% of $140 is 0.9 * $140 = $126.

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

The final answer is: $1596"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Sophia wants to know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. She's already driven 100 miles since her last fill-up and needed 4 gallons to fill it up again. Her car's tank holds 12 gallons.

To figure this out, we need to find out how many miles her car gets per gallon. We can do that by dividing the distance she's already traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know her car's mpg rating, we can find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total miles = tank capacity * mpg
total miles = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total miles = 300 miles

The final answer is: 300"
"Hey there, let's break down Jim's daily routine. He spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. So, in total, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading each day.

Since he does this 3 times a week, we need to calculate the total time spent in one week. That's 3 hours * 3 days = 9 hours.

Now, we need to find out how much time he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks. To do that, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 9 hours * 4 = 36 hours.

However, I think there might be a slight mistake in my previous calculation. If he does this 3 times a week, it means he's doing it 3 times, not 7. So, the correct weekly time is 3 hours * 3 days = 9 hours. But since he does this 4 times a week (assuming he does it every day), the correct calculation is 3 hours * 4 days = 12 hours. 

So, the correct total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 12 hours * 4 = 48 hours.

The final answer is: 48"
"Hey, let's break down the problem. There are four schools competing in a basketball tournament. Each school has a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team, and each team has 5 players. Additionally, each school has a coach for each team.

First, we need to find the total number of students. Since each school has 2 teams with 5 players each, the total number of students per school is 2 * 5 = 10.

Next, we need to consider the coaches. Each school has 2 coaches, one for each team.

So, the total number of people per school is 10 (students) + 2 (coaches) = 12.

Now, we multiply the total number of people per school by the number of schools to find the overall total. There are 4 schools, so the total number of people sent by all the schools is 4 * 12 = 48.

"I'm Kai, a treasure hunter with a passion for solving mysteries. I've been digging through a buried treasure chest, and I've found a trove of gems. Let's count them up.

There are 175 diamonds in the chest. I've also found 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so that's 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.

Now, I've discovered that the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. That's 2 * 140 = 280 emeralds.

To find the total number of gems, I'll add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you out. So, let's dive into the problem. We know there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school, and there are 60 girls. That means the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120.

Now, to find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls together: 60 + 120 = 180.

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5.

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5

The original price of 5 cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750.

The interest charged for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest charged for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total cost of the cell phones is $750 + $15 = $765.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Artie sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot, and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Since Artie has no change, he decides to round all his prices to the nearest dollar.

Rounding the prices, we get:
- Marigolds: $2.74 ≈ $3
- Petunias: $1.87 ≈ $2
- Begonias: $2.12 ≈ $2

Now, let's calculate the total amount Artie will make from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

To find the total amount Artie will make, we add the amounts together:

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question. So, Luke is building a sandcastle with 4 levels, and each level has half the square footage of the one below it. The top level has a square footage of 16. 

Let's break it down: the second level will have half the square footage of the top level, which is 16 / 2 = 8. The third level will have half the square footage of the second level, which is 8 / 2 = 4. The fourth level will have half the square footage of the third level, which is 4 / 2 = 2.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Cecilia just got a new puppy, and she needs to figure out how much dog food to buy. According to her vet, the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. After that, it's 2 cups a day for the rest of its life.

Let's break it down. For the first 180 days, the puppy eats 180 cups of dog food. After that, it eats 2 cups a day for the remaining days in the year, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the puppy eats 2 * 185 = 370 cups of dog food in the rest of the year.

Now, let's add those two amounts together: 180 + 370 = 550 cups of dog food in the first year.

Each bag of dog food contains 110 cups, so we need to divide the total amount of dog food by the number of cups in a bag: 550 / 110 = 5.

So, Cecilia will need 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost per flower for each package. For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower. For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers. 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers. 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers. 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The original price of the grooming is $100. To find 30% of this amount, we multiply it by 0.3.

30% of $100 = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the final cost.

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75
Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

So, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's break down the problem. We know the football team played a total of 22 games. They won 8 more games than they lost. 

Let's denote the number of games they lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We can set up two equations based on this information: W = L + 8 and W + L = 22.

We can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7

Now that we know L, we can find W: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

So, the team won 15 games.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 10% increase for 5 years, and then calculate the salary for the next 3 years.

The initial salary is $600. An increase of 10% of $600 is $60. So, the salary after 5 years is $600 + ($60 * 5) = $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

The increase for the next year is 10% of $900, which is $90. So, the salary after 6 years is $900 + $90 = $990. The increase for the next year is 10% of $990, which is $99. So, the salary after 7 years is $990 + $99 = $1089. The increase for the next year is 10% of $1089, which is $109.1. So, the salary after 8 years is $1089 + $109.1 = $1198.1. The increase for the next year is 10% of $1198.1, which is $119.81. So, the salary after 9 years is $1198.1 + $119.81 = $1317.91.

The final answer is: $1317.91"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we denote the number of copies Harald sold as H, then the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Christina's planning a birthday party and she needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest because 1/4 of the attendees won't show up. She invited 16 friends. Each gift bag costs $2. Let's calculate how much she'll spend.

First, we need to figure out how many guests will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the guests won't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

16 (total guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Now, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Finally, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"Let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the dinosaur picnic. 

First, we need to find out how much an adult and a child will eat. An adult will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult, which is 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad eaten by adults and children. There are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. 

Adults will eat 20 * 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad.

Children will eat 5 * 5 = 25 pounds of potato salad.

The total amount of potato salad needed is 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Cindy has 4 pets.
- Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
- Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"Let's figure out how old Jackson is. We know James is 10 years old and he's 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Now, we know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. It's also given that Lee runs two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles. 

To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time. So, Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, we're told that Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find the time it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles after his diet change, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time. 

10% of 40 is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds. 

Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 must be girls.

Total students = 200
Boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we multiply 2/3 by the total number of girls.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"Hey, let's figure this out. Harry slept 9 hours last night. His friend James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we need to find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept. 
Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours, so the difference is 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"I'm Kai, and I'm happy to help you with your gardening question.

Mary, an avid gardener, received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate how many potted plants she has in total. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

She received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jerome had 4 friends visiting him, and we need to find the total number of doorbell rings.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we multiply 20 by 1/4, which is 5, and then add it to 20. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. We know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all his textbooks. 

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many pages are left to read.

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down John's water consumption. He drinks 4 glasses of water every weekday (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and one before bed) and 1 glass of soda with dinner. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

In total, John drinks 20 glasses of water on weekdays and 6 glasses of water on weekends. So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 20 + 6 = 26.

"To find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to know the rate at which it covers the city and the total distance of the city.

The fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. We can use this information to find out how many 3-mile sections are in the city. The city is 42 miles across, so we divide 42 by 3 to find the number of sections.

42 / 3 = 14

This means there are 14 sections of 3 miles each in the city. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we can multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 * 10 = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The final answer is: 140"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Poppy is working on a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed 250 pieces. That's 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Next, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom placed 250 pieces. That's 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

The final answer is: 500"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amir eats 5 cookies. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, we can find out how many cookies Cody eats by multiplying the number of cookies Amir eats by 3.

Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies they eat together, we need to add the number of cookies Amir eats and the number of cookies Cody eats.

Total cookies = 5 (Amir's cookies) + 15 (Cody's cookies) = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: 20"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's dive into this problem. We have 3 boxes, each with dimensions 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick.

To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. The length of the box is 5 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

The width of the box is 6 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of the box is 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's break down Frankie's TV-watching schedule. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes. That's 2 hours in total.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes 'x'. Since each episode is 30 minutes, or 0.5 hours, the total time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Wednesday is 0.5x hours.

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes of TV, which is 1.5 hours. This is a combination of a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode. 

On Friday, he watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes.

The total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. 

Time spent watching 30-minute episodes is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours. Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you solve the problem.

Let's break down the situation: Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, but he ends up baking 15 more than intended. After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he bakes 2x cookies, but actually ends up with 2x + 15 cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"Hey there, let's calculate the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards. 

The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon, and the app company is offering a cashback of $0.20 per gallon. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, we need to find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards.

First, let's calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards: 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00
Then, we'll calculate the total cashback rewards: 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, let's subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"Hey there, let's dive into the problem. Marcell and Beatrice are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups. They unroll as many as they can find, and we need to figure out how many they ate on average.

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long, while Marcell's are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each, we multiply the width by the length of each roll-up.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

Now, let's add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and divide by 2 to find the average.

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of rowing in feet per second: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

Now, let's divide the total time by the rate to find the total distance rowed: 64 seconds / 1.25 feet/second = 51.2 feet.

Since we are only interested in sets of 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10: 51.2 feet / 10 = 5.12 sets.

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2: 5.12 sets * 2 liters/set = 10.24 liters.

The final answer is: 10.24"

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question.

To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from selling it.

Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each, so the total cost of these boards is 10 * $10 = $100. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each, so the total cost of these boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 each = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 each = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"I'm Kai, and I'll be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that there were initially 2 containers with 5 vehicles each at the port. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we're told that the total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles imported on the second day by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

So, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's salary. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago was 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. To find his new salary, we need to calculate 40% of his old salary and add it to his old salary. 40% of $40000 is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. So, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of her old salary. 40% of $28000 is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. So, Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down Rosie's running schedule. She can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, and then she switches to 5 miles per hour. To find the total distance she can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs at each speed.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour:
Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"I'm Kai, and I'm happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and she puts stamps on one-third of them. This means she stamps 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters.

After stamping 20 letters, the number of letters needing stamps is 60 - 20 = 40. We're given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

Since Jennie stamped 20 letters, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile before she started is 30 - 20 = 10.

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From point 2, we know that Julia had 'x' spoons initially. 
From point 3, we know that after using 3 spoons, Julia had 'x - 3' spoons left.
From point 4, we know that after her husband gave her 5 more spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. 

So, we can set up the equation: x - 3 + 5 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Dylan needed chicken sausages and fish sausages for a party. He bought 38 chicken sausages. He also bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. To find the total number of sausages, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages.

First, let's find out how many fish sausages Dylan bought. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we add 6 to the number of chicken sausages: 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Amy made 20 more friends than Lily at her new school. We know Lily made 50 friends. To find out how many friends Amy has, we need to add 20 to Lily's friend count. 

50 (Lily's friends) + 20 = 70 (Amy's friends)

Now, let's add the number of friends Lily and Amy have together: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"I'd be happy to help you figure out how much money Dillon will spend at the store.

To start, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, we can calculate the cost of a watermelon by multiplying the cost of a pepper by 3. So, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we know that an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon. To find the cost of an orange, we subtract 5 from the cost of a watermelon: $45 - $5 = $40.

Now that we know the cost of each item, we can calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend. He buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180. He buys 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers is 20 * $15 = $300. Finally, he buys 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges together: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the hospital's profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total revenue from patients.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. We multiply the number of patients by the average time per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Now, let's find the total revenue from patients. We multiply the number of patients by the hourly rate charged to the patients and then by the number of hours per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour = 2000 * $200/hour = $400000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $400000 - $30000
Profit = $370000

The final answer is: $370000"
"Let's break down the situation. Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store's Santa village. 

First, a third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. To find out how many elves quit, we need to divide 60 by 3. 60 / 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit.

Now, we need to find out how many elves are left. We subtract the number of elves who quit from the total number of elves. 60 - 20 = 40 elves are left.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. To find out how many elves are left, we subtract 10 from 40. 40 - 10 = 30 elves are left.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June.

Expenditure in May is $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less, so the expenditure in June is $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, let's add the expenditures for the two months: $500 + $440 = $940.

The final answer is: $940"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Pam and Fred went to a carnival, and they had a blast. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, and Fred rode it 4 times. After that, each of them decided to ride the luge 2 times. If each ride cost 6 tickets, let's figure out how many tickets they used that day.

First, we need to find out how many rides each person took in total. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Now, let's add up the total number of rides. 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down Walt's walking miles. On Monday, he walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total. 

41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

The final answer is: 13"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down Tom's car wash expenses. He gets 4 car washes a month, and each one costs $15. To find out how much he pays in a year, we need to calculate the total cost of car washes per month and then multiply it by 12.

The total cost per month is 4 car washes * $15 per car wash = $60.

Now, let's multiply the total cost per month by 12 to get the total cost per year:
$60 * 12 = $720.

The final answer is: $720"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Brian's friend Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made. 

First, let's figure out how many video games Brian has after losing 5. He initially had 20, but he lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Now, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply Brian's remaining video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times Brian's remaining video games is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this by dividing 27 by 3.

27 / 3 = 9

Now that we know there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands, we need to find the number of female Scottish unicorns. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this by multiplying 9 by 2/3.

9 * 2/3 = 6

So, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down Rory's delivery order. She orders 2 subs for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each, and 2 cookies for $1.00 each. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
- Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total cost with the delivery fee:
- Total cost with delivery fee and tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark took a test with 75 questions and another test with 100 questions. He completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete it. Since he completes 5 questions per hour, he would have completed 8 * 5 = 40 questions in that time. However, he only completed 40 questions out of 75, so he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete it. At a rate of 5 questions per hour, he would have completed 6 * 5 = 30 questions in that time. However, he only completed 30 questions out of 100, so he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests: 35 + 70 = 105.

The final answer is: 105"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question.

So, let's break it down. We know there are 12 blue gumballs. We're told that there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs. 

First, we need to find four times the number of blue gumballs. That's 4 * 12 = 48.

Now, we add 22 to that result to find the number of pink gumballs. 48 + 22 = 70.

So, there are 70 pink gumballs in the machine.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a total of 700 bees in the hive. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many babies as queens.

Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We know that W = 2B, since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. We also know that B = 2Q, since there are twice as many babies as queens.

Now, let's use the fact that the total number of bees is 700. We can write the equation W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Since B = 2Q, we have B = 2(100) = 200.

Since W = 2B, we have W = 2(200) = 400.

So, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

The final answer is: 400"
"Hey there, let's calculate how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working instead.

First, we need to figure out how many hours he would work in a week. Since he plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working, he would work 2 hours more each day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

Now, let's calculate his weekly earnings. His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"Let's break down the costs of John's purchases. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the food items. John bought milk for 2 dollars and eggs for 3 dollars. The total cost of the food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the non-food items. John bought light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. The total cost of the non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Since there's a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount. To do this, we multiply the cost of the non-food items by 0.1 (which is the decimal equivalent of 10%). So, the tax is 10 * 0.1 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items with tax to get the total cost: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

The final answer is: 16"
"I'm Kai, and I'm happy to help Kim calculate his profit from his housekeeping business. 

To determine the total profit, we first need to calculate the total income and total expenses. Kim has 8 clients in total, which includes 3 current clients and 5 potential clients he's confident about. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question.

To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

There are 100 pineapples per hectare. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Johnny's cleaning up his room and he's got three Lego sets to pick up. The first one has 500 pieces, the second one has 3 times more pieces than the first one, and the third one has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one.

Let's figure out how many pieces are in each set. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add up the number of pieces in each set: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: 2125"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 that many bees return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.

So, the total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees. However, 15 of these bees returned, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 45 - 15 = 30 bees.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.

Now, let's consider the bees that have not returned yet. We already had 30 bees that hadn't returned, and 60 more bees left in the last 6 hours. However, we're only interested in the bees that left before the last 6 hours, which is the initial 30 bees. The 60 bees that left in the last 6 hours are not included in this count.

So, in the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive, which is the initial 30 bees.

The final answer is: 30"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Brittany and her mom went to the museum. The cost of admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom bought 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket. If she received $8 in change, I need to figure out how much money she gave the cashier.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, I need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

"Let's break down the information given:

- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up an equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has ""x"". Then, Charlie has 3x friends.

We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two people, Steve and Tim, competing to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives 3 miles away from the school and can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school and can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, Steve's distance is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet, and Tim's distance is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home. Time is equal to distance divided by speed.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 15840 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 36 minutes

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 36
Difference in time = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you out. So, Shawnda decided to start a bike inflation service in her neighborhood. She charges 25 cents per tire. On the first day, 5 people came by with their bicycles, and each bike has 2 tires. That's 5 * 2 = 10 bicycle tires. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, 3 people came by with their tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires. That's 3 * 3 = 9 tricycle tires. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, 1 person came by with their unicycle, which has 1 tire. 

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies inside. Each cookie costs $0.10. If Carl pays with a $10 bill, how much change will he receive?

To find the total cost of the cookies, we need to multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack and then multiply that by the cost per cookie. 

Number of packs: 10
Cookies per pack: 6
Cost per cookie: $0.10

Total number of cookies: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies
Total cost: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is the difference between the $10 bill and the total cost of the cookies.

Change = $10 - $6 = $4

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially. 
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 14 (by Dave) + 7 (by seagull) = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. 
   After the pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries were left. The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   We can simplify this to (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   We can solve for x by first adding 1 to both sides: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Then, multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18.
   Finally, add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three types of baked goods: rolls, chocolate croissants, and baguettes. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long, which is equivalent to 24 inches.

First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Blake and Kelly are running on a 100-yard football field. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means he covers a distance of 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Now, let's look at Kelly's runs. She runs back and forth once, covering 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers for this part is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards, Blake is the winner. To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Raphael went to buy some school supplies. He bought 4 pens which cost $1.5 each, 2 notebooks which cost $4 each, and a rim of bond paper which cost $20. Let's calculate how much he spent in total.

First, we need to find the cost of the pens. Since there are 4 pens and each costs $1.5, we multiply 4 by $1.5 to get the total cost of the pens. That's 4 * $1.5 = $6.

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks. There are 2 notebooks, and each costs $4, so we multiply 2 by $4 to get the total cost of the notebooks. That's 2 * $4 = $8.

Now, we know the cost of the bond paper is $20.

To find the total amount Raphael spent, we add the costs of the pens, notebooks, and the bond paper together. So, we have $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you out. So, Finn is watching the pond, and he initially sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out of hiding from under a lily pad. That brings the total to 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. But wait, 2 of them hide under a rock, so Finn can't see them anymore. To find out how many tadpoles Finn can see now, we need to subtract the 2 that hid: 17 - 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the tank's water depth on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so we add 7 to 17 to find the depth on Tuesday.

17 + 7 = 24

Now, we need to find the depth of the water on Wednesday, which is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To do this, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. To find the total number of fish he caught, we need to add these numbers together.

10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19

Now, let's find out how many fish Locsin caught. He caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
He caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
He caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the number of fish Locsin caught: 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13

To find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin, we add their totals together: 19 (Anakin's total) + 13 (Locsin's total) = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a bag of marbles that initially costs $20, and the price increases by 20% every two months.

To find the cost after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

After 2 months, the price will be:
Price = Initial price + (Initial price * Increase percentage)
= $20 + ($20 * 0.20)
= $20 + $4
= $24

After 4 months, the price will be:
Price = $24 + ($24 * 0.20)
= $24 + $4.80
= $28.80

After 6 months, the price will be:
Price = $28.80 + ($28.80 * 0.20)
= $28.80 + $5.76
= $34.56

We'll continue this process for the remaining 30 months.

After 8 months, the price will be:
Price = $34.56 + ($34.56 * 0.20)
= $34.56 + $6.912
= $41.472

After 10 months, the price will be:
Price = $41.472 + ($41.472 * 0.20)
= $41.472 + $8.2944

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 5 red cars, each costing $4, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

We also have 3 action figures, and each one costs $5. So, the total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which means it costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the toys: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

"Let's break down the situation. If Jackie decides to do her taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, which means she'll lose $35/hour in missed income. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself:
Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant:
Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

Since the income lost is greater than the cost of hiring the accountant, Jackie will actually be better off hiring the accountant. To find out how much more money she'll have, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:
Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

"Let's break down Elvira's expenses for her new computer and accessories. She has a budget of €1500 for the entire purchase. 

The computer itself costs €1090, and she also buys a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. 

To find out how much she spent in total, we add these costs together:
€1090 + €157 = €1247
€1247 + €74 = €1321
€1321 + €102 = €1423

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget to find out how much she has left for clothing:
€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits their daughter. To make a Spanish flan, she needs 3 eggs. If Sandra has been tasked to make 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser, let's figure out how many times she has to babysit.

First, we need to find out how many eggs Sandra needs in total. Since she needs 3 eggs per Spanish flan and she's making 15, she needs 3 * 15 = 45 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job: 45 / 9 = 5.

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for her school fundraiser."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we denote Brooke's current age as B, then Seth's current age is 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and 2B + 2. The sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write an equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Ethel has $8. To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday (5 days), and 10 miles a day on Saturday and Sunday (2 days). 

So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is 20 * 5 = 100 miles. 
The total miles he walks on Saturday and Sunday is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, the marching band is ordering new uniforms, and I'm here to help them figure out the total cost. Each uniform comes with a hat, a jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, which is 3 * $25 = $75. 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pants. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Next, he sees 90 insects, and each of them has 6 legs. That's 90 * 6 = 540 legs from the insects.

Lastly, he sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates, and each of them has 10 legs. That's 3 * 10 = 30 legs from the mutant invertebrates.

Now, let's add all these legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Jessica's trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. She's got a student loan with a minimum payment of $300, a credit card with a minimum of $200, and a mortgage with a minimum of $500. But she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum for each one.

To find out how much she pays in a year, I'll first calculate the increased minimum payment for each debt. For the student loan, that's $300 * 1.5 = $450. For the credit card, it's $200 * 1.5 = $300. And for the mortgage, it's $500 * 1.5 = $750.

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500. Since Jessica pays this amount each month, I'll multiply it by 12 to get the total annual payment: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Billy's got a big family reunion barbecue to prepare for, and he's in charge of peeling and cutting 60 potatoes for the potato salad. Each potato takes about 1.5 minutes to peel and 5 seconds to cut. Let's break it down.

First, we need to convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 5 seconds is equal to 5/60 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time it takes to peel all the potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time it takes to cut all the potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes.

Finally, we add the peeling and cutting times together: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes.

So, it'll take Billy a total of 95 minutes to peel and cut all 60 potatoes.

The final answer is: 95"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons.

First, we need to find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, the total revenue per gallon is:
20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

Since they made a profit of $25, their total revenue is the sum of the profit and the cost. Let's call the total cost 'x'. Then, the total revenue is:
Total revenue = Profit + Cost
Total revenue = $25 + x

Since they sell each gallon for $10, the number of gallons they sold is:
Total revenue = Number of gallons * $10/gallon
$25 + x = Number of gallons * $10/gallon

Now, we can solve for the number of gallons:
Number of gallons = ($25 + x) / $10

The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The cost of sugar per gallon is $2, so the cost of lemons per gallon is:
Cost of lemons per gallon = $5 - $2 = $3

The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:
Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 * (($25 + x) / $10)

Since we are given that the total profit is $25, we can set up the equation:
Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$10 * Number of gallons - ($3 * Number of gallons) - ($2 * Number of gallons) = $25
$10 * (($25 + x) / $10) - $5 * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25

Simplifying the equation:
(10 - 5) * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
5 * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
(25 + x) / 2 = $25
25 + x = $50
x = $25

Now that we have the total cost, we can find the cost of lemons:
Total cost = $25
Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
Total cost of lemons = $25

The final answer is: $25"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know there are a total of 240 participants in the race. Out of these, 80 are Japanese. To find the number of Chinese participants, we subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants.

Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we're told that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

"Let's break down Zaid's expenses step by step.

First, Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. His monthly salary is 6000 dollars, so the amount spent on rent is 1/4 * 6000 = 600 dollars.

Next, he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. The amount spent on car fuel is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000 dollars.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel: 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400 dollars.

Zaid then donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. Half of 3400 is 1700, so he donates 1700 dollars to charity.

After the donation, the remaining amount is 3400 - 1700 = 1700 dollars.

Next, Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars for their expenses. The total amount given to his family is 200 + 700 = 900 dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the amount Zaid has left: 1700 - 900 = 800 dollars.

5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored for 8 hours at the same rate. We multiply the number of hours by his hourly rate again:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations and 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write the equation 5x = 200. To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40.

y = 4 * 40
y = 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can write an equation to represent the situation two years ago:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * Jan's age two years ago + 5
Since Jan is 30, two years ago Jan was 28. 
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * 28 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19

Now, we know Mark's age two years ago was 19. To find Mark's current age, we add 2 to this:
Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:
Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down the problem. We have two teams competing in a 4 by 400 meter relay. The well-rounded team has four members, each running 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The less well-rounded team has a similar setup, but their first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

Now, let's calculate the time for the less well-rounded team. Their first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a six-sided die, which means there are 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The favorable outcomes for this are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 total outcomes, making the probability 3/6 or 1/2, which is equivalent to 50%.

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the die is rolled again, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Since these events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. 

50% - 25% = 25%

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can find out how many she picked by dividing the number of apples her mom picked by 2. That's 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

Now, to find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out how many rats are in each cage. 

Let's break it down step by step. We know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. That's a total of 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw for the hamsters.

We also know that there's a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among them.

So, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. That's 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw for the rats.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. Let's say the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Now, we know that the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, so we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they agreed to have a monthly interest rate of 2%. If Mandy pays it off after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount she should give to Benedict.

To do this, we'll calculate the interest for each month and add it to the initial amount. The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

For the first month, the interest is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
For the second month, the interest is ($100 + $2) * 0.02 = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
For the third month, the interest is ($102 + $2.04) * 0.02 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

Now, let's add up the interest: $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

Finally, we add the interest to the initial amount: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of buying and transporting the bags. The cost of buying each bag is $20, and the cost of transporting each bag is $2. So, the total cost for 'x' bags is $20x + $2x = $22x.

Next, we know that the trader made a profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each. This means the total revenue from selling the bags is the total cost plus the profit, which is $22x + $400.

Since the total revenue is also equal to the number of bags sold multiplied by the selling price, we can set up the equation:
$30x = $22x + $400

Now, let's solve for 'x'. Subtracting $22x from both sides of the equation gives us:
$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the costs of the trip to the fair. The three friends spent $20.25 on tickets. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, which means they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

The cost of the rides is $33 per ride, and they went on 2 different rides, so the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the tickets, food, and rides: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is $34."
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, John collects peaches for 3 hours, and he can collect 2 peaches a minute. To find out how many peaches he collects, we need to figure out how many minutes he collects for. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of peaches per minute by the total minutes: 
2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, you want to know how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day to survive. To figure this out, we need to calculate their weekly insect needs first.

Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are ten ducks in the flock. So, the total pounds of insects they need per week is 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds.

Now, to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day, we divide the total pounds of insects per week by 7 (the number of days in a week). That's 35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tom starts with 50 trees. Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. This means the net change in the number of trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. So, after 10 years, Tom has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

Now, we subtract the trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out the mystery of the pink and white flamingos on Sue's front yard.

So, let's start from the beginning. On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard. That's the starting point.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Violetta wants to buy some new crayons. She's got $20 to spend and she needs 5 different colors. Each crayon costs $2. Let's see how much change she'll get.

First, we need to figure out how many crayons she can buy. We can do that by dividing the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon.

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. That's a total of 10 crayons.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crayons she's buying.

Total cost of crayons = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 * $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

To find out how much change she'll get, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has.

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 
Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"Let's break down the problem. We have 200 pounds of carrots that need to be distributed to 40 restaurants. Each restaurant is supposed to receive 2 pounds of carrots.

To find out how many pounds of carrots will be used, we multiply the number of restaurants by the pounds each restaurant receives: 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds.

Now, we subtract the total pounds used from the initial amount to find out how many pounds will not be used: 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

First, let's add the number of men and women together: 8417 + 9092 = 17509.

So, there are 6277 kids in Soda."
"Let's break down Elaine's Pokémon card collection. Initially, she had 20 cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Since Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Baldur gets water from a well, and he gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. Each pail contains 5 liters of water. To find out how many liters of water he gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

First, let's add the number of pails he gets in the morning and the afternoon: 5 pails + 6 pails = 11 pails.

Now, we multiply the total number of pails by the amount of water in each pail: 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day."
"Let's break down John's situation. He wins an award with a $5000 monetary reward and a 5% raise in salary. His original weekly salary is $2000. 

First, we need to calculate the 5% raise:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = 100
New salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will have the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year. 

Now, let's calculate his total income for the year:
Total amount made that year = New salary * Number of weeks
= 2100 * 52
= 109200

The total amount John made that year is $109200."
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question. So, Josie has a 10-acre farm where she grows grapes. Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. To find out how many barrels of wine her farm produces per year, we need to do some math.

First, let's calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year. We have 10 acres, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes, so we multiply 10 by 5 to get the total tons of grapes.

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Now that we know Josie has 50 tons of grapes, we need to find out how many barrels of wine that makes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we multiply 50 tons by 2 barrels/ton.

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down Carl's cheese usage for the week. He ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used a total of 7 * 2 = 14 slices for his sandwiches.

For breakfast, Carl had cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. That's 3 slices per omelet. So, for the 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for his omelets.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week, using 8 slices of cheese in it.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used for each meal: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. To find the total number of pens she had initially, we add these two numbers together: 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of blue and red pens she bought. Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the number of blue and red pens she bought: 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

Finally, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Brinley's in Mr. Bert's math class, and he gives six tests each semester. He lets the students drop the lowest score from the average each semester. Brinley's got scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five tests. She wants to get an average of 93 on all six tests.

To find out what score she needs on the sixth test, we first need to figure out the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert lets the students drop the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Since Brinley needs a total score of 558 for the semester, we need to find the score she needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

The final answer is: 291"
"Let's break down Michael's bike riding into two periods. 

In the first period, he rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Each time, he rode 25 kilometers. So, the total kilometers for this period is 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

In the second period, he rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks. Each time, he rode 60 kilometers. So, the total kilometers for this period is 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

To find the total kilometers, we add the kilometers from both periods: 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: 860"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Joe's bag of Halloween candy has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and we're given that each chocolate bar weighs 40g.

First, we need to find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each one weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Next, we need to find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we can find the total weight of the bag of candy by adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: 2600"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Sara wants to buy a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. That's a total of $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved up. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids and $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate how much more money she needs to earn.

She needs $70 - $10 = $60 more to buy the jacket and shoes. She earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting. So, she needs to earn $60 - $20 = $40 from mowing the lawn.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jerry has a certain number of red chickens and white chickens, and the total number of eggs collected is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We also know that W = R + 2.

The total number of eggs collected can be represented by the equation: 3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get: 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get: 3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms: 8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides: 8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8: R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Gary likes to walk around the edge of the local park, which is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he walks at 3 miles/hour, I can help him figure out how many hours he spends walking.

To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Day 1: 100 customers
- Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total by Day 3: 500 customers

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's dive into the problem. We have two pools, both leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is 2x gallons.

The total amount of water leaked from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, let's consider the current situation. The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 gallons (since 4 gallons leaked out). The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 4 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes that costs $320.00 and a matching belt that's $32.00. To figure out how many hours she needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn.

First, let's add the cost of the shoes and the belt together.

Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we know Lori makes $8.00 an hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we'll divide the total cost by her hourly wage.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she needs to pay a total of $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (10% of $2000) = $2200.

Now, let's calculate how much she will pay in 12 months. She pays $165 per month, so in 12 months, she will pay a total of $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then add 3 to each age.

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Naomi scored 68 points. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. To find out how many points Yuri scored, we need to calculate half of Naomi's points first. Half of 68 is 34. 

Now, we add 10 to that to find out Yuri's points: 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we add 17 to Naomi's points: 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. Let's add them up: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we need to find out how many points Jojo scored. We subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Andrew's planning a road trip from New Jersey to Rochester. He's going to take the bus one way and the car the other way. It takes him 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. Since he's going to travel back by car, it'll take him half as many days, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to add the number of days it takes to travel to Rochester by bus and the number of days it takes to travel back from Rochester by car. So, 6 (by bus) + 3 (by car) = 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down James' Pokémon card collection. He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

First, he loses 8 water type cards. This leaves him with 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. The total number of cards he has now is 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 32 (water) = 82.

Next, he buys 14 grass type cards. This increases the number of grass type cards to 20 + 14 = 34. The total number of cards he has now is 82 + 14 = 96.

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100. 

Percentage chance = (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.333...%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"Let's break down Chad's burrito order. The base burrito costs $6.50. He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. The total cost of the extra items is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.

The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00. Chad upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. He has a gift card for $5.00, which he uses at checkout.

To find out how much Chad still owes, we subtract the gift card amount from the total cost: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"I'm Kai, and I'm happy to help you with this puzzle problem.

To figure out how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to know their combined rate of placing pieces. Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which is 2 pieces per minute.

Their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Now, let's calculate how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle. We can do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate.

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

So, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. 30% of the total watermelons were ready, so we multiply 120 by 0.3 to get the number of ready watermelons.

0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons.

Now, we need to find out how many watermelons were left after two months. We subtract the number of ready watermelons from the total number of watermelons.

120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Next, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, so we multiply 84 by 0.75 to get the number of ready watermelons.

0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons.

Finally, we need to find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after two weeks. We subtract the number of ready watermelons from the number of remaining watermelons.

84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's break down the costs for Mark's fleet of cars.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars. Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each, so the total cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the cars. Mark pays 10% tax on the total cost of the cars, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Then, we need to calculate the registration fee for the cars. Mark pays $1000 for each car, so the total registration fee is 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fee: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday.

Let's start by finding out how many shells Kylie collects on Monday. We know that Robert collects 20 shells, and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert. So, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

Now, let's find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday. We know that she collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.

25 * 2 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Dax went to their farm to pick some apples and found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. If there were 50 ants, let's figure out the total number of insects in the garden.

Since there were half as many bugs as ants, we can find the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects.

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out how many penguins are still sunbathing in the snow.

There are 36 penguins initially. One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean, which is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner, which is also 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

In total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the sunbathing area.

Now, let's calculate how many penguins are still sunbathing: 36 - 24 = 12

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Steve's trying to grow his own cherry tomatoes, and he's a big fan of eating them. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and he's downing 6 tomatoes per day. To figure out how many vines he needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats in a week.

Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total tomatoes he eats per week: 
6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Now, we know Steve's girlfriend eats half as much as him, so she's eating 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day. 
His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, so we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find the number of vines needed: 
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

The final answer is: 21"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, John wants to order some pizzas for his friends. There are 20 friends in total, and he wants to make sure each can have 4 slices. Pizzas are only sold sliced into 8 portions. Let's figure out how many pizzas John needs to order.

First, we need to find out the total number of slices required. We can do this by multiplying the number of friends by the number of slices per friend: 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza to find out how many pizzas John needs to order: 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Ram buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low. He can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens. 

First, let's find out how many new pens he can make from the ink of the 25 pens he buys. Since he can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens from the first 25 pens.

Now, he has 5 empty pens left. He can use the ink from these 5 pens to make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen.

So, the total number of pens he gets is 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens from the first 25 pens) + 1 (new pen from the 5 empty pens) = 31 pens.

The final answer is: 31"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down Johnny's situation. He started with $20 and added an extra $10 to it, which gives him a total of $30. Now, this sum of $30 tripled in a year. To find the final amount, we need to multiply $30 by 3.

$30 * 3 = $90

"Let's break down the information given. We know Jessa is 20 years old. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25. 

Now, we know Mary is two years younger than Joan. To find Mary's age, we subtract 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23.

To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we add their individual ages together: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the school hall. We know that 30% of the students went out through exit A. To find the number of students who left through exit A, we calculate 30% of 1000.

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left in the hall. We subtract the number of students who left through exit A from the total number of students.

Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

Next, we're told that 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find the number of students who left through exit B, we calculate 3/5 of 700.

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left in the hall after some went out through exit B. We subtract the number of students who left through exit B from the remaining students.

Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280

Finally, we need to find out how many students went out through exit C. Since the rest of the students went out through exit C, we can say that the number of students who went out through exit C is equal to the remaining students.

280 students went out through exit C.

The final answer is: 280"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. John has 54 candies.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.
3. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54 - 33 = 21.

So, Dolly reads 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books. Pandora reads 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

In total, they read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike has 5 pen pals initially, but he stops being pen pals with 2 of them. This leaves him with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Each of his remaining pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and since there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"Hey there, let's break down Jason's phone plan situation. He has a plan for 1000 minutes per month. Every day, he has a 15-minute call with his boss, and he's also used 300 extra minutes for other calls this month. Since this month has 30 days, we need to calculate how many minutes he's used in total.

First, let's find out how many minutes he used for his daily calls: 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes. Then, we add the extra minutes he used: 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used from his total plan minutes: 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, after Billy took his share, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two aquariums with snails and fish. One aquarium has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference in snails is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The equation based on the given information is 28 = 2(2x). To solve for x, we can start by simplifying the right side of the equation:

28 = 4x

Now, divide both sides by 4 to isolate x:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost for each day of makeup. The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and it takes 6 hours to do each day. So, the cost per day is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since Jean needs the makeup done 4 times a week, the cost for 4 days a week is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost for the makeup is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, Jean gets a 10% discount on the total cost. To find the discount, we multiply $30,000 by 0.1, which is $3000.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Now, since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, there are 3 people in total. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 / 3 = $32

So, each person paid $32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. To find the total weight of the onions, we multiply the number of bags by the weight per bag.

Total weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find the total cost. The cost per pound of onions is $1.50. To find the total cost, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound.

Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister.
- Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.
- Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
- Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies
- Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
- Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
- The difference in calories consumed = 9200 - 3600 = 5600

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that the school has 3 classes with 20 students in each class. So, the total number of students in the school is 20 * 3 = 60.

We're also given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

Now, we know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33. 

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 33 = -3.

However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of students. This means that the given information is inconsistent.

But, if we assume that the given information is correct, then the number of boys in the third class is -3."

Then, we add the apps he downloaded: 52 + 18 = 70

So, Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46.
The total number of cougars killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 
21 * 4 = 84.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Sylas initially had 10 stalls with 20 cows each. That's a total of 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Then, he bought 40 more cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide the total number of new cows by the number of stalls:

40 / 10 = 4

So, Mr. Sylas added 4 cows to each stall. Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section.

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight.

30% of 8000 is 0.3 * 8000 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books. Since she has 8 books and each one is $0.50 overdue, we multiply 8 by $0.50. That's 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.

Now, we add the flat fee of $2.00 to the cost of the overdue books. So, $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

The total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00.

2. Andrea has 52 apples.
3. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
5. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
6. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then divide that by the number of cookies per cup of flour.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5. 

Since 5.5 dozens is the same as 5 dozen and 6 cookies, we need to calculate the flour needed for 6 cookies. 6 cookies is half of a dozen, so we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we need to add the flour needed for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. 5 dozen cookies need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

So, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

To do this, we need to find two thirds of 9,300. We can calculate this by multiplying 9,300 by 2 and then dividing by 3.

First, we multiply 9,300 by 2: 9,300 * 2 = 18,600.

Next, we divide 18,600 by 3: 18,600 / 3 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Carmen has $100. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up their individual amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that fits within her $400,000 budget. She found a property with a selling price of $350,000. On top of that, there's a brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price, and a transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price.

To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. The selling price is $350,000. The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500. The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Now, let's find the difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget. That's $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to find the total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

We then subtract the total fees from the selling price to find the net selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: 71"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the total spent on newspaper ads and television ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, let's break down the problem. The juggler can juggle 16 balls, and half of them are golf balls. That means there are 8 golf balls. Now, we need to find out how many of those golf balls are blue. Since half of the golf balls are blue, we can divide the number of golf balls by 2.

8 / 2 = 4

So, there are 4 blue golf balls."
"Hey, let's break down the problem. Mary buys 3 bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300 M&Ms in it. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. 

The third bag has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. To find half of 300, we divide 300 by 2, which equals 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The final answer is: 762"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 2 houses, and each house has 3 bedrooms. So, the total number of bedrooms is 2 * 3 = 6.

Each bedroom has 2 windows, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, let's consider the additional windows in each house. There are 4 windows in each house that are not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 2 * 4 = 8.

To find the total number of windows, we need to add the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows. So, the total number of windows is 12 + 8 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. 

The cost of the cocoa is $4.20, the laundry is $9.45, and the pasta is $1.35. 

To find the total cost, we add these amounts together: 
$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65
$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00

The mother pays $20, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid: 
$20 - $15.00 = $5.00

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to find the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Mrs. Rylan has been busy planting her farm with different types of vegetables. She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds. I need to figure out how much money she spent on these seeds.

A packet of tomato seeds costs $40, and a packet of celery seeds costs $30. To find the total amount she spent, I'll calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.
The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

Now, let's add the costs together: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to find the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Mico and Marco want to get to know each other, and they found out that the sum of their ages is 20. To find out what their ages will be in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages.

Let's call Mico's current age M and Marco's current age m. We know that M + m = 20. In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

We can simplify this by combining like terms: (M + m) + 20. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute that in to get 20 + 20 = 40.

However, we need to add 10 to each of their ages, so we need to add 20 to 20, not just 20 + 20. So, the correct calculation is 20 + 20 = 40, and then we add 20 to that result, which is 40 + 20 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given two pieces of information about Ruby and Sam's ages. Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

The first piece of information tells us that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which can be written as R = 6S.

The second piece of information tells us that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as (R + 9) = 3(S + 9).

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is: 6"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down Peter's purchases. He bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, which is a total of 20 * $0.25 = $5. Then, he also bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, which is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

To find the total amount Peter paid, we just need to add these two amounts together: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of spots on the cobras. Since there are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Next, we need to find the total number of spots on the mambas. Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

To find the total number of spots on both the cobras and the mambas, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Maddy is buying pizza for her cousin's soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests. A pizza will serve 3 people. If each pizza costs $15, how many dollars will Maddy spend?

First, let's figure out the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's 15 people. Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests. In total, Maddy needs to buy pizza for 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so Maddy will spend 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question. 

To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we need to find the total length of the space between the gemstones. 

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

Now, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: 25 - 8 = 17 inches. However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: 1.75 / (1/4) = 1.75 / 0.25 = 7.

So, Katerina uses 7 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 7"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Alani's family decided that the kids should write some stories, and they had to read them out to the family at the end of the weekend. Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, her brother Braylen wrote 40 stories, and her sister Margot wrote 60 stories.

Let's calculate the total number of stories they wrote in the first week. Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60. So, the total number of stories in the first week is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

Now, let's see what happened in the second week. Each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. Alani doubled her stories from 20 to 40, Braylen doubled his stories from 40 to 80, and Margot doubled her stories from 60 to 120.

So, in the second week, Alani wrote 40 stories, Braylen wrote 80 stories, and Margot wrote 120 stories. The total number of stories in the second week is 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week. That's 120 + 240 = 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, I'm trying to figure out how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years. I know Ann is 9 years old, and her brother is twice her age. 

To find her brother's current age, I'll multiply Ann's age by 2. That's 9 * 2 = 18 years. 

Now, I need to add 3 years to his current age to find out how old he'll be in 3 years. That's 18 + 3 = 21 years.

"Hey, let's break down Kelly's situation. She has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 
Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

The total amount Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount she has. 

145 - 55 = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the flag has three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. 

First, we need to find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, you've got a landscaping company delivering flagstones to a customer's yard, and each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. You want to know how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

To figure this out, we need to find the total weight of the flagstones. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds and there are 80 flagstones, the total weight is:
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two cars, one in the fast lane and one in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, while the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

We know that the car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles. To find the time it took for the car in the fast lane to cover this distance, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

Plugging in the values, we get: time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Now, we need to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance. Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles per hour, we can use the same formula: time = distance / speed.

Substituting the values, we get: time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, so the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let x be the total number of medals given out. Then, 10x = 39 (since Ali and Izzy have 39 medals together).

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

The total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. There are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get: 16 / 8 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Susan's earnings for the online task. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break in between, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

To find out how much she earns, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the points of the three friends after the fourth round.

Mike initially has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 21 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82."
"Let's break down the problem. Will buys 15 oranges and asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

"Hey there, let's break down Darren's workout routine. He starts with 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses on the first day. 

On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He does 10 fewer squats than the first day, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats. And he doubles the number of dumbbell presses, which is 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Now, let's calculate the total number of activities for each day. For the first day, it's 100 + 50 + 20 = 170. For the second day, it's 120 + 40 + 40 = 200.

To find the total count of activities in two days, we add the totals of both days: 170 + 200 = 370.

The final answer is: 370"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step. We know each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

"Let's break down Sam's sales for the week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so we'll ignore those days. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates.

To find the total number of crates sold, we add up the sales from each day: 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

Now, let's compare this to his target of 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total number of crates sold from the target: 120 - 65 = 55.

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Carmen starts with a bid of $200 and each subsequent bid increases by $50. There are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them. This means there are 3 bids from the other people, and then 3 bids from Carmen, making a total of 6 bids.

To find the total cost of the desk, we need to calculate the sum of these 6 bids. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 200, d = 50, and n = 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

The final answer is: $1950"
"Let's break down John's driving expenses. He commutes 30 miles to work and back each day, which is a total of 60 miles per day. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, his weekly commute is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. 

Over the course of 50 weeks in a year, John's total commute is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year. 

John is charged $2 per mile, so his total driving cost is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

In addition to the driving cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, his total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

To find the total cost, we add the driving cost and the bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, let's break it down. 

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we can consider the following arrangement:

- The first page (page 1) is on the left back.
- The second page (page 2) is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back.
- The 31st page is on the right front.

This pattern continues until we reach the middle of the paper, where the 16th page is on the left back and the 15th page is on the left front. 

After the middle, the pattern reverses, with the 17th page on the right back and the 16th page on right front.

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, we need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages (left and right sides) and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages (left and right sides).

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 (for the first 16 pages) + 2 (for the last 16 pages) = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Annika went to the town fair with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides.

To find out how much she has left, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount. The total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

So, Annika has $50 - $35 = $15 left.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at $20, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45.

To find the total amount of money she earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year. We know that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many in the first year, so the number of books sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

Now, let's find the number of books sold in the second year. We know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books sold in the three years is 250 - 50 = 200. We already know that 45 + 90 = 135 books were sold in the first and second years combined. Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 135 = 65.

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = $1300.

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"Hey, let's break down the problem. John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he lost to, we need to find 20% of 20.

20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4

So, John lost to 4 people.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we multiply 60 by 2/3.

60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. We subtract the morning sales from the total number of loaves produced.

60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we multiply the remaining loaves by 1/2.

20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, not 2 pounds. Since Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight in the same amount of time as Joey, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds by 4.

The number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds is 4 weeks. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we multiply 4 weeks by 4: 4 weeks * 4 = 16 weeks.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the savings on the tubs of ice cream. The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

Next, we need to find the savings on the packets of milk. The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

Now, we add the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk to find the total savings. $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a serum that makes the drinker grow extra limbs at specific intervals. 

First, we need to figure out how many extra arms the person will grow. Since they grow an extra arm every 3 days, we divide the total number of days (15) by 3 to find out how many times this happens. 15 / 3 = 5, so they'll grow 5 extra arms.

Next, we need to calculate how many extra legs the person will grow. They get an extra leg every 5 days, so we divide the total number of days (15) by 5. 15 / 5 = 3, so they'll grow 3 extra legs.

Now, we just need to add the number of extra arms and legs together to find the total number of new limbs. 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down Theo's expenses for his business trip to South Africa.

First, he buys 6 business suits at $100 each, which costs 6 * $100 = $600. Then, he buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, totaling 3 * $50 = $150. 

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the total cost of these items: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

To find out how much he has left, we subtract the total cost from his initial budget: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost so far) = $4050.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract this from his remaining budget: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

This means he has $2050 left over, which he can spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a family of 5 people, and we know that three of them eat 3 eggs each day, while the other two eat 2 eggs each day.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs eaten by the three people who eat 3 eggs each day. That's 3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs eaten by the two people who eat 2 eggs each day. That's 2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add the total number of eggs eaten by both groups to find the daily total. 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to multiply the daily total by 7 to find the total number of eggs consumed in a week. 13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. To find Jane's age, we subtract 3 from Quinn's age: 30 - 3 = 27.

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we add 5 to Jane's age: 27 + 5 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Noah's current age. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old. Since then, Noah has aged 6 years, so his current age is 20 + 6 = 26 years.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old at that time, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. This means the current population is twice the population six years ago, which is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total number of players on the football team is 105. 

We're also given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense. If we denote the number of players on the defense as D, then the number of players on the offense is 2D.

Additionally, there are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, which means the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

To simplify this, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, we can solve for D by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:

D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

The final answer is: 30"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Martha's planning a Christmas party, and she invited some families. Let's break it down.

She invited 2 families with 6 people each, which is 2 * 6 = 12 people. Then, she invited 3 families with 4 people each, which is 3 * 4 = 12 people. That's a total of 12 + 12 = 24 people invited.

However, 8 people couldn't make it due to illness. That leaves us with 24 - 8 = 16 people.

But, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. Since 1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2, we need to subtract those 2 people as well.

So, we have 16 - 2 = 14 people showing up for Martha's party.

The final answer is: 14"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with the problem.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. His father also gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

First, let's find out how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, let's add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna to the marbles already in the store: 20 + 50 = 70. Then, we add the marbles his father gave him: 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the information given. We know the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. We're also told there are 30 boys in the classroom.

First, we calculate the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3:
Girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we find the number of nongendered children by multiplying the number of boys by 1/10:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children in the classroom:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question.

The ratio of electric poles to electric wires needed to connect and supply electricity in a neighborhood is 1:3. If the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can use this ratio to find the number of electric poles required.

Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. If 1 electric pole requires 3 electric wires, then the number of electric poles (x) multiplied by 3 should equal the total number of electric wires, which is 45.

So, the equation is: 3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find out how many people left, we need to calculate 1/4 of 40, which is 40 * 1/4 = 10.

Since 10 people left, the number of people remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were 25 men initially, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 (because 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men).

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question. 

To find out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider the weakening caused by both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's figure out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide the total temperature difference by the cooling power of each ice cube: 65 / 13 = 5.

Now, we know that 5 ice cubes are added, and each one makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. So, the weakening caused by the ice cubes is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

To find the total weakening, we add the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out how many old records Ralph's customers brought in. 

Let's break it down: 5 people came in and left with 7 new records between them. Since they traded 2 old records for 1 new record, we need to find out how many old records were traded for those 7 new records. 

Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the number of old records traded is twice the number of new records. 

Number of new records = 7
Number of old records traded = 2 * Number of new records
Number of old records traded = 2 * 7
Number of old records traded = 14

Now, we know that all 5 people brought in the same number of old records. To find out how many old records each person brought in, we can divide the total number of old records traded by 5.

Number of old records per person = Number of old records traded / Number of people
Number of old records per person = 14 / 5
Number of old records per person = 2.8

Since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records.

Total number of old records = Number of old records per person * Number of people
Total number of old records = 2.8 * 5
Total number of old records = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"

To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers:
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
= 2/5 * 100
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is:
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers:
Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Now, let's find the salary of senior programmers:
Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:
Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's find the total amount paid to all programmers:
Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

Now, we know that 7 people got off at the second bus stop. So, before that, there were 12 + 7 = 19 people on the bus.

We also know that 5 people got on at the first bus stop. So, before that, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

Since there were 14 people before the first bus stop, that means there were 14 people who got on the bus at the terminal.

The customer's loyalty card gives them $1 off their next purchase for every $20 they spend. On their last shopping trip, they spent $80, which means they earned 4 rewards. 

Now, let's move on to their current shopping trip. They spent $43 and used their rewards, which is $4 off the price. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

"Let's break down the information given for the two job options.

For Job A, we know the hourly wage is $15 and the total hours worked per year is 2000. To find the total income, we multiply the hourly wage by the total hours worked: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year.

Next, we need to calculate the income tax for Job A. The state has a 20% total tax rate, so we multiply the total income by the tax rate: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. Subtracting the income tax from the total income gives us the net income for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, we know the total annual income is $42,000. However, there's a property tax of $6,000 and a 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax. First, we subtract the property tax from the total income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Then, we calculate the income tax by multiplying the net income by the tax rate: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. Subtracting the income tax from the net income gives us the final net income for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, let's compare the net incomes of the two jobs to find the difference. We subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the price of the shares after the first year. The initial price of each share is $8, and it increases by 50%. To find the increase, we multiply the initial price by 0.5 (which is the same as 50% or 50/100). 

Increase in the first year: 0.5 * $8 = $4
Price of each share after the first year: $8 + $4 = $12

Next, we need to find the price of the shares after the second year. The price after the first year is $12, and it decreases by 25%. To find the decrease, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.25 (which is the same as 25% or 25/100).

Decrease in the second year: 0.25 * $12 = $3
Price of each share after the second year: $12 - $3 = $9

Now that we have the price of each share after the second year, we can find the total value of all shares. Maria has 8 shares, and each share is worth $9.

Total value of all shares: 8 * $9 = $72

The final answer is: $72"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. Since John ate half the amount Thomas ate, we can divide the number of hot dogs Thomas ate by 2: 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a class of 200 students that's split into 3 groups. Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two.

Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. So, we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x: 
70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals on his farm, and they are all either chickens or cows. We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, we can say that H = 2C.

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation H + C = 60.

Substituting H = 2C into the equation, we get 2C + C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Since H = 2C, we can find the value of H by multiplying C by 2, resulting in H = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Josh wants to perform at the school talent show, and he's been practicing juggling. He starts with 3 balls and adds 1 more each week for 4 weeks. That's a total of 3 + 4 = 7 balls.

When he's on stage, he drops 3 balls, but 2 of them are caught by the crowd. Unfortunately, 1 ball gets lost in the dark auditorium. 

So, Josh is left with 7 - 1 = 6 balls to juggle.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that a pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, a green toad, and that's 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, but 20 pounds more than a red bird. We're also told that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds each. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. On the other hand, the red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of the animals and the container. The total weight will be the sum of the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, red bird, and the container itself, which weighs 20 pounds.

50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds

The final answer is: 260"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits that her child no longer needed. Then, at her baby shower, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits. That's a total of 24 + 48 = 72 outfits from her friend and the baby shower. Her mom also gifted her with another 15 baby outfits. To find the total number of outfits, we just need to add those up.

Total outfits = 72 + 15 = 87

The final answer is: 87"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find the new daily distance, we need to calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters.

1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters.

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"Let's break down the prices of the juice boxes. Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we need to subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C. That's 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two types of tables in the restaurant: some with 4 legs and some with 3 legs. 

First, we need to find the total number of legs for each type of table. For the tables with 4 legs, we multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs. 

Next, we do the same for the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of tables to get the total: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

The final answer is: 310"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Jenny buys a bag of cookies that contains 36 cookies. Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, which is a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies used by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to subtract the total number of cookies used by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in the bag. 

36 - 27 = 9

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The discount is 40% of $30.

40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt.

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to get the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase in the amount the factory makes per day, we need to first find the difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they made per day when they made tractors.

The amount they made per day when they made tractors is 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000 per day.

The amount they make per day now is 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they made per day when they made tractors is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down Madeline's expenses for her dog. We know that food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. To find the monthly food cost, we multiply the weekly cost by 4:

Food cost per month = $25 * 4
Food cost per month = $100

Now, let's add the cost of treats and medicine to the food cost. Treats cost $20 per month, and medicine costs $100 per month.

Total cost per month = Food cost per month + Treats cost per month + Medicine cost per month
Total cost per month = $100 + $20 + $100
Total cost per month = $220

To find the total cost per year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12.

Total cost per year = Total cost per month * 12
Total cost per year = $220 * 12
Total cost per year = $2640

The final answer is: $2640"
"Let's break down Peyton's after-work activities for the week.

On Monday, Peyton has a one-hour yoga class. On Tuesday, she has a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga, which is 3 hours. On Wednesday, she has a half-hour cheese-tasting event. On Thursday, she has a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class, which is 1.5 hours. Finally, on Friday, she has two hours of errands.

To find the total time, we need to add up the time for all activities:

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, April is donating plant pots to a local school for their new garden. They need 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. That's 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

To find the total number of plant pots they need, we add the daisies and roses together: 30 + 60 = 90.

April already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Andrea started with $36. She spent $11 on a sweater, so she had $36 - $11 = $25 left. Then, she gave her brother $4, leaving her with $25 - $4 = $21.

To find out how much she saved, we need to subtract the amount she had after spending and giving her brother money from the initial amount.

Initial amount: $36
Amount after saving: $21

Amount saved = Initial amount - Amount after saving
Amount saved = $36 - $21
Amount saved = $15

"Let's break down John's activities. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. He also watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We know that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. If 30% of the total time is 6 hours, we can find the total time by dividing 6 by 0.30. That's 6 / 0.30 = 20 hours.

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. That's 0.40 * 20 = 8 hours.

"Hey there, let's break down Annabelle's situation. She's trying to save for a phone that costs $400. She already has $80 in her savings. 

First, let's calculate how much she earns from her jobs. At her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work. That's $10 * 20 = $200. 

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work. That's $5 * 15 = $75. 

Now, let's add up her earnings from both jobs: $200 + $75 = $275. 

To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $275 = $125.

So, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out the height of the tallest tree in Eddy's backyard.

Let's start by finding the height of the second tree. It's 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, which is 6 feet. So, the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Now, we need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. We already know the shortest tree is 6 feet, and the second tree is 11 feet. So, the combined height is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. That means it's 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much Dean spent on toy cars. Since each toy car costs $2 and he bought 6 of them, the total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, we need to find out how much Dean spent on teddy bears. Since each teddy bear costs $1 and he bought 5 of them, the total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears to find the total amount Dean spent: $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially received $28 from his mother, and then he got an extra $10. So, the total amount of money he has now is $28 + $10 = $38.

Finally, let's subtract the amount Dean spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Morgan's dad has a budget of $90 for her birthday party. She wants to spend it on mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities. A round of mini-golf costs $5, and Morgan and her friends will play one round. The cost of the mini-golf is $5. 

The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 

The cost of go-karts is $10 per ride, and Morgan and her friends will ride twice. The cost of go-karts is 2 * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

However, we need to subtract Morgan's cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $35 = 1.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.57 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $55 - $5 = $50. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$50 / $35 = 1.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.43 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $50 - $20 = $30.

$30 / $35 = 0.86

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.86 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the mini-golf in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $30 - $5 = $25.

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.71 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $25 - $5 = $20.

0.57 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $20 - $5 = $15.

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.29 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $10 - $5 = $5. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$5 / $35 = 0.14

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.14 ≈ 0

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's figure out how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank. She gets $5 as pocket money every day from her parents and buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each every day.

First, we need to convert the cost of lollipops from cents to dollars. 25 cents is equal to $0.25. So, 4 lollipops cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day. Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops = $5 - $1 = $4.

To find out how much she saves in 5 days, we multiply her daily savings by the number of days. Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days = $4 x 5 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much money Billy had left after buying the candy. He started with $10 and spent an unknown amount on candy. Let's call the amount of candy he bought 'x' pounds. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is 1.5x.

The amount of money Billy had left after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

He then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Carver is 45 years old, and his age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can represent his son's age as 'x'. 

The relationship between Carver's age and his son's age can be expressed as:
Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:
45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':
50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the distance from the third city to the first city. To do this, we add the distances from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city, then subtract 50 miles.

Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Combined distance: 75 + 100 = 175 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance traveled in one trip. 
Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 125 miles
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is:
Total distance in one trip: 300 miles
Total trips in a day: 3
Total distance in a day: 300 * 3 = 900 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we need to divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day.
Total distance between services: 18,000 miles
Total distance in a day: 900 miles
Number of days between services: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2. 
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 
Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"Let's break down John's trip into two parts: driving to his friend's house and driving back home.

To find the time taken to drive to his friend's house, we need to calculate the distance first. The original distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance to his friend's house is 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles.

Time taken to drive to his friend's house = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the time taken to drive back home. The distance to drive back home is 240 miles, and John drives at a speed of 80 mph. 

Time taken to drive back home = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to friend's house + Time taken to drive back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

S = 4 * 3 - 5
S = 12 - 5
S = 7

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
V = 3 * S
V = 3 * 7
V = 21

If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we need to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. 
Let's denote the number of people kicked out for other reasons as O. 
The total number of people kicked out is the sum of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons.

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's start with the picture frames. Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20. Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to consider the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost, which is 20% of $20, or $4 per frame. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching together. $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will also receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Lastly, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 of 44, or 11 seniors. These officers will receive cords that cost $12 each. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

To find the total cost of all the gifts, we add the cost of the picture frames and etching, the cost of the pins, and the cost of the cords together. $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double that number of shoes, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:
50 * 2 = 100

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. 

First, let's find the total number of books in the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns: 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, we need to find double the number of books, which is 2 * 36 = 72.

Finally, Wendy wants 20 more than double the number of books, so we add 20 to 72: 72 + 20 = 92.

The final answer is: 92"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Erica initially made 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she got 2 * 15 = 30 cards from her dad.

Now, Erica has 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She then passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

After giving away 29 cards, Erica had 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

Finally, she received 17 cards from family and friends, so she now has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"Hey, let's break down the pizza problem. Jenny has a 12-slice pizza. She gives 1/3 to Bill, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. Then, she gives 1/4 to Mark, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices. Now, let's subtract those from the original 12 slices: 12 - 7 = 5 slices. But wait, Jenny also ate 2 slices. So, we need to subtract those as well: 5 - 2 = 3 slices.

The final answer is: 3"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Mark has $50 in his bank account and he earns $10 per day at his work. He wants to buy a bike that costs $300. To figure out how many days he needs to save, we can divide the cost of the bike by the amount he earns per day.

Cost of the bike: $300
Amount earned per day: $10

Number of days = Cost of the bike / Amount earned per day
= $300 / $10
= 30

The final answer is: 30"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Nancy is cleaning out her old woodshed and she's found a bunch of bugs. She's got 90 spiders, and then there are millipedes that are 1/3rd as many as the spiders. That's 90 / 3 = 30 millipedes. 

Now, let's figure out how many stink bugs she's got. It's said that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, that's 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

To find the total number of bugs, we just add up the spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Erica is 30 years old.
2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35.
3. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem. John drank 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. To find the total ounces of milk he drank, we multiply the number of glasses by the ounces per glass: 2 * 8 = 16 ounces.

Now, we know milk has 3 calories per ounce. To find the total calories consumed by John, we multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce: 16 * 3 = 48 calories.

The final answer is: 48"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many days the builder works in a year. He works 4 weeks every month, and there are 12 months in a year. So, the total number of weeks he works in a year is 4 * 12 = 48 weeks.

Since he works 6 days every week, the total number of days he works in a year is 48 * 6 = 288 days.

Now, let's find out his daily earnings. He gets paid $50 every day.

So, his total earnings in a year would be his daily earnings multiplied by the number of days he works in a year.
Total earnings = $50 * 288
Total earnings = $14400

The final answer is: $14400"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles. To figure out how many bags of flour Mark needs to buy, we divide the total amount of flour required by the amount of flour in each bag.

Total flour required = 4 * 3 cups = 12 cups
Flour in each bag = 2 cups
Number of bags of flour = 12 / 2 = 6

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we divide the total amount of milk required by the amount of milk in each bottle.

Total milk required = 4 * 1 cup = 4 cups
Milk in each bottle = 2 cups
Number of bottles of milk = 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk.

Difference = Number of bags of flour - Number of bottles of milk
= 6 - 2
= 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to find the energy used per day and then subtract the new energy used from the original energy used.

The original energy used per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new energy used per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh.

The energy saved per day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. Then, there's a zebra with 36 stripes. We also have another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88. We also need to count the total number of zebras, which is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Tyson's planning to make some muffaletta sandwiches for the big game. Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and it'll serve 4 people. There are 20 people watching the game, so we need to figure out how much he'll spend on the meat and cheese.

First, let's calculate how many sandwiches he needs to make. We divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, Tyson needs 5 pounds of each. 

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis. This means he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan then buys 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 fewer corns than that, which is 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, let's add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought: 
Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 20
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200."
"Let's break down Elliott's steps. He finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. Half of 10,000 is 5,000 steps. 

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

The final answer is: 2000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and it averages 200 words per page, we can calculate the total number of words in the book.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Now, we can find the time it takes to read the book by dividing the total number of words by Toby's reading rate of 300 words per minute.

Time to read the book = Total words / reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so we need to add this to the time it takes to read the book to find out the total time Toby will be at the airport.

Total time at the airport = Time to read the book + Time to get to the airport = 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we can find out how many minutes early he will be by subtracting the time he arrives from the time he has to be there.

Time early = Time to be at the airport - Total time at the airport = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"I'd be happy to help you with the problem. To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out how much money Sally has left after her shopping spree at the seashore.

Let's break down the costs of the items she bought. The taffy was on sale, where she got 1 pound for $3 and the second pound for half off, which is $1.50. So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each, which is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

He gets a 20% discount on them, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240. 

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

He also buys a finale firework that costs $150.

To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To figure out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days and then divide that number by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she eats in 30 days, we multiply 2 by 30:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the conditions given. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

However, the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog. The more dangerous candles are the ones that are not guaranteed to not explode, which is 1% of the total candles. So, the number of more dangerous candles is 0.01 * 50000 = 500.

Now, we need to find 5% of the more dangerous candles, which is 0.05 * 500 = 25.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Next, Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Since the average trees are not specified, let's call the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees 'x'. The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a herd consisting of camels and dromedaries. We know that there are 180 heads and 304 bumps in total.

First, let's consider the number of heads. Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is equal to the sum of the number of camels and the number of dromedaries. We can write this as an equation:

C + D = 180

Now, let's consider the number of bumps. Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each. So, the total number of bumps is equal to twice the number of camels plus the number of dromedaries. We can write this as another equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"Let's break down Tom's trip into manageable parts. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

Next, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is (30/100) * 800 km = 240 km. So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and his comb fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below. To find the elevation where the comb landed, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation.

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"I'd be happy to help you out with this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

Next, we're told that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Now, let's substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we get: 3T - 6 = 18.

Adding 6 to both sides, we get: 3T = 24.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"

First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses: 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

Next, we'll calculate the capacity of the minibusses: 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

And finally, we'll calculate the capacity of the minivans: 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add all these capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Lillian's garden is looking a bit bare without any bird feeders, and she's decided to add some. She builds 3 and buys 3 others. Each bird feeder seems to attract 20 birds throughout the day, but there's a twist - the homemade feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones.

Let's break it down. The homemade feeders attract 30 birds each (20 + 10), and since there are 3 of them, that's 3 * 30 = 90 birds. The store-bought feeders, on the other hand, attract 20 birds each, and since there are 3 of them, that's 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

So, if the same amount of birds keep coming to her bird feeders, Lillian can expect to see a total of 90 + 60 = 150 birds in her garden each day.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you out. So, Kenny wants to buy a ticket to an amusement park that costs $100. He's planning to sell his Pokémon cards to get the money, and he's selling them for $1.5 each. He's got some cash already, $50, so he only needs to make $50 from selling the cards.

To figure out how many cards he needs to sell, I'll divide the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5 = 33.33

Since you can't sell a fraction of a card, I'll round down to 33 cards. Now, we know that Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with.

Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.33

To find x, I'll multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to figure out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since he prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs, that's 18 guests with two hotdogs each. So, 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests.

For the other half of the guests (also 18), he prepared one hotdog each. That's 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs. 

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were needed. 

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. This means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Let's calculate the total cost of her order.

First, we need to find the total cost of the items before the discount. We have the set of pot and pans for $120.00, the set of mixing bowls for $20.00, and 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each. So, 5 x $5.00 is $25.00. Now, let's add all these costs together: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 20% of the total cost before the discount, which is $165.00. To find 20% of $165.00, we multiply $165.00 by 0.20. This gives us $33.00 as the discount.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final cost. $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"Let's break down Dora's situation. She wants to buy a skipping rope for $6, a board game for $11, and a playground ball for $2. 

First, we need to find the total cost of these items. We add the cost of each item together: $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has some money saved up from her allowance, which is $2, and her mother gave her $16. So, in total, Dora has $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the information given. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Three quarters of 100 is 75. 

Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons. Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce, having forgot his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. One-fifth of 150 is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down the problem. We have 15 gallons of gas that are equally divided into 5 different containers. To find out how much gas is in one container, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3 gallons per container

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 pints per container

Josey needs 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. To find out how many pints that is, we multiply 24 by 1/4.

24 * 1/4 = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money George had initially. Since he spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money. This means 1% of his money is equal to $0.01, and 99% of his money is equal to $5 - $0.01 = $4.99.

Now, let's find out how much money George spent on chips. The cost of 3 bags of chips is 3 * 40 cents = $1.20.

The amount of money George spent on chips is $1.20. To find out how much he spent on candy bars, we subtract this from the total amount he spent: $4.99 - $1.20 = $3.79.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find the number of candy bars George bought by dividing the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: $3.79 / 0.75 = 5.0533.

Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's figure out how many lollipops Ray's friends got. He had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. To find out how many he shared, we subtract the ones he kept from the total: 25 - 5 = 20.

Now, we need to divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends, which is 4. So, 20 / 4 = 5.

Each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Rory made a cake that weighs 20 ounces and cut it into 8 equal pieces. She and her mom each had a piece. To find out how much the remaining cake weighs, we need to figure out how much they ate and subtract that from the total weight.

First, let's find out how much each piece weighs. We can do that by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, we need to find the total weight of the cake they ate. We can do that by multiplying the weight of each piece by 2.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is: 15"
"Hey there, let's figure out how many oranges everyone will get. Sitti and Juris have a total of 34 and 22 oranges, respectively. To find the total number of oranges, we add them together:

34 + 22 = 56

They're sharing these oranges with 6 other friends, making a total of 8 people. To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Antoine's French onion soup recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount. So, he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box. Therefore, the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

To find the total cost of the ingredients, we add the cost of onions and beef stock: $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we can find the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's. So, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time difference.

If Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, and she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.

So, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how many beads each sister has and then determine the difference between their total bead counts.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question.

So, let's break down the situation. Marcus wakes up to a house temperature of 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and his oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. That's a total increase of 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Now, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. For every 10 minutes the window is open, the house cools down by 2 degrees. So, for 30 minutes, it cools down by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

To find the final temperature, we need to add the initial temperature, the temperature increase, and the temperature decrease. That's 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"Let's break down the triathlon times for Jon and James. 

First, let's convert Jon's times into minutes: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to swim and bike. 
- James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's, so it is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes.
- James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to run. 
Total time for James: 180 minutes
Time for James to swim and bike: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
Time for James to run: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour.

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we're told that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Finally, we're asked to find the length of Movie A, which is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To do this, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Michael is racing his horse, and for every mile it runs, it eats half a bail of hay. A bail of hay costs $3. The horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH. First, we need to convert the time to hours since the speed is in miles per hour. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours.

Now, let's calculate the distance the horse runs. Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats half a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Rozanne is making eggnog for her family, and she's got a few things going on. She's using 4 dozen eggs from cases and 2 loose eggs from her cupboard. 

First, let's figure out how many eggs she has in total. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Now, each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so Rozanne can make 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Rozanne's got these trays that each hold 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by 5. That's 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

Joey's initial points: 214
Points scored by Joey: 26
Joey's total points after his turn: 214 + 26 = 240

Next, we'll look at Marcy's situation. She starts with 225 points and scores 10 points. To find out how many points she has after her turn, we need to add those two numbers together.

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10
Marcy's total points after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

"Let's break down the information given:

You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?

Let's analyze the situation: If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If you buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"I'd be happy to help you with this problem. 

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900. To find the cost of filling one balloon, we need to divide the total cost by the number of balloons: 900 / 20 = 45.

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. Multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11050.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. 

First, we need to find out how many sapphires she has left. To do this, we subtract the number of sapphires she traded from the total number of sapphires she started with: 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires.

Next, we need to find the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, we multiply the number of sapphires she has left by the value of each sapphire: 5 * $800 = $4000.

Now, we need to find the value of the rubies she received. Since each ruby is worth $1200, we multiply the number of rubies she received by the value of each ruby: 2 * $1200 = $2400.

Finally, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of her jewels: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Bob needs to buy potting soil for his vegetable garden. He has 10 raised beds, and each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. To find out how much soil he needs, we first calculate the volume of one bed. 

The volume of one bed is length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two dogs, Jennifer's and Brandon's, with their respective puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, out of which 3 have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, with 4 of them having spots.

To find the total number of puppies, we simply add the number of puppies from both dogs.

Total puppies = 8 (Jennifer's dog) + 12 (Brandon's dog) = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. We do this by adding the number of spotted puppies from both dogs.

Total puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's dog) + 4 (Brandon's dog) = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed he's buying. 

First, let's calculate the weight of each type of feed. 

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Grayson recycles cans and bottles for money each week. An aluminum can is worth two cents and a plastic bottle is worth three cents. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. Let's break it down.

First, we need to find out how much she earns from the cans and bottles separately. For the aluminum cans, she drinks 3 cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, that's 3 * 2 = 6 cents from the cans.

Next, for the plastic bottles, she drinks 5 bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, that's 5 * 3 = 15 cents from the bottles.

Now, let's add the earnings from the cans and bottles together. 6 cents from the cans + 15 cents from the bottles = 21 cents per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4. 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Miss Maria is a middle school teacher who loves collecting sports cards. She has six decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, which gives her a total of 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards.

She also has five boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, totaling 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards.

To find out how many cards she has in total, we add the basketball and baseball cards together: 150 + 200 = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives the remaining 350 - 50 = 300 cards to her students.

Each student gets 10 cards, so to find out how many students she has, we divide the total cards given by the number of cards each student gets: 300 / 10 = 30.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Becky paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents. Since there's a $1 discount, we subtract 100 cents from the total cost: 900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 800 cents / 100 = $8.

Next, we need to find out how much Kelly paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents. Since there's a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of 1000 cents. To do this, we multiply 1000 cents by 0.1: 0.1 * 1000 cents = 100 cents. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: 1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 900 cents / 100 = $9.

Now that we know how much both Becky and Kelly paid, we can find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. We subtract Becky's total cost from Kelly's total cost: $9 - $8 = $1.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes. So, he now has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes. Now, he has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. To find out how many shoes he has left, we subtract 180 from 300, which is 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final answer is: 120"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles in her pantry, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. She wants to use up all her sprinkles, and each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To figure out how many pans of cupcakes she should bake, I'll first calculate how many cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has.

Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, she can decorate 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Now, I need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, I'll divide 48 by 12 to get the number of pans.

48 / 12 = 4

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes."
"To find the cost of the paper, we need to calculate three times the price of the pen and then subtract $1 from it. 

Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6. 
The cost of the paper is $6 - $1 = $5.

The total cost of the pen and the paper is $2 + $5 = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10, so the change she received is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

There are 30 students in Marissa's class, and each student started the year with 10 pencils. To find the total number of pencils initially in the class, we multiply the number of students by the number of pencils each student had.

Total pencils initially = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find the number of pencils used, we multiply the total pencils by 1/5.

Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils

Now, we subtract the pencils used from the total to find the remaining pencils after two months.

Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find the number of pencils left, we multiply the remaining pencils by 1/3.

Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils

The final answer is: 80"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Matt wants cookies, but his dad is all about healthy snacks. The deal is, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. Matt wants a total of five cookies. Let's figure out how many carrot sticks he needs to munch on.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. According to the deal, he gets half as many cookies as carrot sticks, plus two extra. That's (1/2)x + 2 cookies. Since Matt wants a total of five cookies, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to get his 5 cookies."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a 10-foot shark with 2 remoras attached to it, and each remora is 6 inches long. To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their length from inches to feet.

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing it by 12. 

6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

Now that we know the length of one remora in feet, we can find the combined length of the two remoras by multiplying the length of one remora by 2.

Combined length of remoras = 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we'll divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

So, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem. We're told that three-fourths of the students at a certain grade level have a desktop computer at home. This means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We're given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, which is equal to one-fourth of the total number of students.

We can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to isolate x:
x = 20 * 4
x = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many days Jason has to walk in total, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Sarah went to buy some books and spent $300 on them. Each book costs $15, and she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To figure out how many books each kid got, I need to find out how many books she bought in total.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Now, since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, I'll divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 9 kids in Gina's class are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To find the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts, we need to add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtract the number allergic to both to avoid double-counting.

So, we add 9 (dairy) and 6 (peanuts), which gives us 15. Then, we subtract 3 (both) to get 12. This is the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts.

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class, which is 32. This gives us 32 - 12 = 20.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, the company decided to take its employees on a tour to explore an ancient site. They divided the employees into 3 groups of 200 each. Each group was assigned 7 tour guides. To find the total number of people going on this tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and add the number of tour guides.

First, let's find the total number of employees. Since there are 3 groups of 200 employees, we multiply 3 by 200 to get the total number of employees: 3 * 200 = 600.

Next, we need to find the total number of tour guides. Each group has 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups, so we multiply 3 by 7 to get the total number of tour guides: 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, we add the total number of employees and tour guides to get the total number of people going on the tour: 600 (employees) + 21 (tour guides) = 621.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Tom's planning an anniversary getaway for his wife, and I'm here to help him figure out the total cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since they're both going, that's 2 tickets at $5000 each, which comes out to 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Now, let's talk about the hotel. It's a busy weekend, so the price is 20% higher than the normal rate of $1500 per day. To find the new price, we multiply $1500 by 1.2, which gives us $1800 per day. Since they're staying for 3 days, the total hotel cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

To get the total cost of the trip, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

"Let's break down the information given. Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, which means Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper also has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes together: 2 + 9 = 11.

Three-quarters of 48 grains is (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains.

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

"Let's break down the problem. Gabriel has 20 songs on his portable media player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Since the player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs to his player. Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we need to subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add. So, 80 - 40 = 40.

2/5 of 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 oranges.

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.
24 oranges * $10/orange = $240.

"Hey there, let's break down James' running routine. He runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. To find out how many miles he runs in a week, we multiply the miles he runs per day by the number of days he runs per week.

Miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
= 60 miles/week

Now, we know James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the total hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles run in a week by his speed.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Uncle Ben has four horses, and each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal. Since he feeds them twice a day, each horse eats 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Now, we need to find out how much oats all four horses consume in a day. Multiply the amount of oats each horse eats by the number of horses: 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats needed by the weight of one bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Jana has 27 puppies, and two thirds of them are Pomeranians. To find out how many Pomeranians she has, we can multiply 27 by 2/3.

27 * (2/3) = 18

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. Now, we need to find out how many of them are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can multiply 18 by 1/3.

18 * (1/3) = 6

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add the temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48°F, in Northlandia is 21°F, and in Midlandia is -3°F.

First, add the temperatures: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Then, divide the sum by 3: -30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F."
"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, an 8-year-old kid wants to buy a toy car that costs $12. He already has $4 saved up. To figure out how many days it'll take him to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first.

The remaining amount is the total cost minus the amount he already has. So, remaining amount = $12 - $4 = $8.

Now, let's see how many days it'll take him to save the remaining amount. He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out the number of days, we'll divide the remaining amount by his daily savings.

Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2 = 4

So, it'll take the kid 4 days to save the remaining amount."
"Hey, let's figure this out. Jaime has 64 eggs and 2 trays that can hold 24 eggs each. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we need to see how many eggs can fit on the trays in total.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs that can fit on the trays is 24 * 2 = 48 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs that can fit from the total number of eggs Jaime has: 64 - 48 = 16 eggs.

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

The final answer is: 16"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Sally bought one small pizza for $8 and a family-size pizza that costs 3 times as much as the small one. To find out how much she spent in total, I'll first calculate the cost of the family-size pizza.

The cost of the small pizza is $8, and the family-size pizza costs 3 times that amount. So, the family-size pizza costs $8 * 3 = $24.

Now, I'll add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

$8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Heather buys razors that come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. They're on sale, buy one get one free, and she has a $2.00 coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors, which is $4.00. She also gets a $2.00 discount with her coupon, so the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, let's find out how many razors Heather will get in total. Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 9 cheerleaders who are 64"" tall and 1 who is 60"" tall. 

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Charisma works 8 hours a day and has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour. To find out how many minutes she walked in total after 5 days, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Since she walks 5 minutes every hour and works 8 hours a day, she walks 5 * 8 = 40 minutes every day.

Now, let's multiply the daily minutes by the number of days she worked: 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's figure out how old Angela is right now.

First, we need to find out how old Brett will be in four years. Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he'll be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

Now, we know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, we multiply Brett's current age by 3: 14 * 3 = 42.

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is now, we need to subtract 4 from 42: 42 - 4 = 38.

So, Angela is currently 38 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Paul drives his car twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, for 14 days. The cost of the morning ride is $6, and the cost of the afternoon ride is $2.

To find the total cost of the morning rides, we multiply the number of days by the cost per ride: 14 days * $6 per day = $84.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the afternoon rides: 14 days * $2 per day = $28.

Now, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides to find the total amount Paul spent on driving his car: $84 + $28 = $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so she has a total of 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, which means she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Now, let's add the total number of oranges they have together: 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can calculate the total number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by 3: 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem. Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends. However, the first venue doesn't include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). The cost of the second venue is $25x (per person charge).

We can set up the equation: 200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides: 200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20: 10 = x

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. 

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

The sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. We can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Mariah's grandma was teaching her to knit, and they used some yarn. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. There are 364 yards in a skein of yarn. To find the total yards of yarn they used, we need to calculate the yards used by each of them and then add them together.

First, let's find the yards used by Mariah. Since she used 1/4 of a skein, we multiply 364 yards by 1/4:
1/4 * 364 = 91 yards

Next, let's find the yards used by her grandma. Since she used 1/2 of a skein, we multiply 364 yards by 1/2:
1/2 * 364 = 182 yards

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together:
91 + 182 = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Cherrie wants to buy Christmas gifts for her 5 friends. 2 of her friends want 5 gifts each, and the other 3 friends want 2 gifts each. She also decides to surprise them with 10 more random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for the friends who want 5 gifts each. That's 2 friends multiplied by 5 gifts, which is 2 * 5 = 10 gifts.

Next, we calculate the number of gifts for the friends who want 2 gifts each. That's 3 friends multiplied by 2 gifts, which is 3 * 2 = 6 gifts.

Now, we add the gifts for both groups of friends, which is 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts Cherrie bought, so the total number of gifts is 16 + 10 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. 

So, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Now, we need to find the length of the couch. It's 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 

Adding 2 feet to this, we get the couch's length = 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out how much Suzie paid for each pack of strawberry gum.

Let's break down the information we have: Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She got 2 packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, we need to find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost.

We know that the total cost is the sum of the costs of all the packs of gum. Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

Since the total cost is $7, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make.

To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar and then calculate how many of that type of wood he can buy with his budget.

A 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks and costs $4, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50.
A 2 x 8 gives 400 sticks and costs $6, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67 (round down to 66.67 since we can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood).

Since 66.67 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Mario needs to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs. Each dog has 4 legs, and he needs a pair of snowshoes for each dog. To find the total number of snowshoes needed, we multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs per dog: 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of snowshoes: 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we know that each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair: 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Janet takes two bus trips five days a week. Each bus trip costs her $2.20. To figure out how much she spends on bus trips in a week, we need to multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of trips she takes in a week.

Cost of one bus trip: $2.20
Number of trips in a week: 5

Total weekly cost of bus trips: $2.20 * 5 = $11.00

Now, let's see how much she would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20. 

Weekly bus pass cost: $20
Weekly bus trip cost: $11.00

Amount saved: $20 - $11.00 = $9.00

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals: 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

However, this equation is not necessary. We can simply use the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. This means that the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 1/4 of the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.

The total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. To find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can divide this total by 4:
16 / 4 = 4

So, Sophia bought 4 onions and potatoes in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find out how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day to reach his goal, we first need to determine the number of days he has to lose the weight. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5 calories per day.

The final answer is: 614"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Gerald works at a daycare and earns $30 every day. He worked for an entire week, which is 7 days. To find out how much he earned, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he worked:
$30/day * 7 days = $210

Now, we know Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he earned:
$210 - $100 = $110

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Hannah's gym teacher wants her to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km. To find out how much water she needs to drink, we need to calculate the total distance she'll run.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. So, let's multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs per kilometer:
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

"Let's break down Julie's expenses step by step.

First, Julie spent 20% of her initial $500 on clothes. To find 20% of $500, we multiply 0.2 by $500, which equals $100. So, she spent $100 on clothes.

Now, we subtract $100 from the initial $500 to find the remaining money: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find 25% of $400, we multiply 0.25 by $400, which equals $100. So, she spent $100 on CDs.

Now, we subtract $100 from the remaining $400 to find the final amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

Julie had $300 left.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We're also told that the house cost three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 

Ali has 4 $10 bills, so the total money from these bills is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has 6 $20 bills, so the total money from these bills is 6 * $20 = $120. To find the total money, we add these two amounts together: $40 + $120 = $160.

Next, Ali gives his sister half of the total money. Half of $160 is $160 / 2 = $80. After giving his sister half, Ali has $160 - $80 = $80 left.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of $80, we multiply $80 by 3/5: (3/5) * $80 = $48. After buying dinner, Ali has $80 - $48 = $32 left.

The final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $32."

"I'm Kai, and I'm happy to help you with Martha's wool shopping list. To figure out how many skeins of wool she needs, let's break it down by item.

For the hats, Martha will need 3 children * 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins. 

For the scarves, she'll need 3 children * 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins.

For the sweaters, Martha will need 3 children * 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins.

For the mittens, she'll need 3 children * 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins.

For the socks, she'll need 3 children * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins.

Now, let's add up the total number of skeins needed for each item: 6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins.

"It's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm.  Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour, while Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.  Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, and Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy.

To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to find the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with Jackson's tulip problem. 

To find out how many rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to calculate the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips separately.

For the red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6

For the blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. 

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be used for the granola and snack mix. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. So, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Hey there, let's break down Ada's electric bill situation. She uses 12 kilowatts per hour daily, and she's planning to add a device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. 

First, we need to find out her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device. 

Daily consumption before adding the device: 12 kilowatts per hour
Weekly consumption before adding the device: 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour
Cost before adding the device: 84 * $1.50 = $126

Daily consumption after adding the device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour
Weekly consumption after adding the device: 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour
Cost after adding the device: 98 * $1.50 = $147

Now, let's find the difference in her weekly electric bill: $147 - $126 = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we need to figure out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, 5 people can paint half a house in 5 / 5 = 1 day. 

Now, if 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days (because 2 * 0.5 = 1).

To convert the time from days to hours, we multiply the number of days by 24. So, 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for a total of $48. To find out how many more CDs he could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to first determine how much money he spent on the headphone set.

Total money spent = $48
Money spent on the CD = $4
Money spent on the headphone set = Total money spent - Money spent on the CD
Money spent on the headphone set = $48 - $4 = $44

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.
Money spent on the headphone set = $44
Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = Money spent on the headphone set / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought = $44 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 11

Next, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CD.
Total money = $48
Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = Total money / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought = $48 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 12

Now, let's find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = Number of CDs that could have been bought - Number of CDs that actually bought
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 12 - 1
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down Josh's workout routine. He spent 4 hours working out every week except for a few occasions. There was a time when he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, and another time when he spent 6 hours in one week.

To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours, the weeks where he spent 5 hours, and the week where he spent 6 hours.

For the weeks where he spent 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (since 8 - 2 = 6). 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week where he spent 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add up the total hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Now, let's figure out how many passengers get on at the second stop. It says 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times the number of passengers who got off (21) fewer passengers get on. 3 times 21 is 63, so 63 fewer passengers get on. Since we are looking for the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This means that 63 more passengers got on.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122.

The final answer is: 122"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age:
   Difference = Jame's current age - cousin's current age
             = 22 - 47
             = -25

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference:
   Difference = | -25 |
             = 25

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer = $2,400
2. Cost of the computer = $1,100
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, we need to find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with the problem.

So, there are 20 kids on a school trip, and they're divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. The boys go out for a scavenger hunt and bring back 60 seashells each. Now, the girls bring back an amount equal to the number of shells the boys brought, plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Let's break it down. The boys brought 60 seashells each, and there are 10 boys, so the total number of seashells they brought is 10 * 60 = 600.

Now, the girls brought 60 seashells (the same as the boys) plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Four times the number of seashells the boys brought is 4 * 60 = 240. So, the girls brought 60 + 240 = 300 more seashells than the boys.

The total number of seashells the girls brought is the number the boys brought (600) plus the extra 300, which is 600 + 300 = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells the girls brought (900) by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought: 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Nick had twice as many candies as George. If we let the number of candies George had initially be x, then Nick had 2x candies initially.

Next, George ate 5 candies, so he has x - 5 candies left. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation x - 5 = 3.

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation, which gives us x = 8.

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find out how many candies Nick had. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, I'm trying to figure out how old Anne is. I know Chenny is 10 years old, and Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. To find Alyana's age, I'll subtract 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, I need to find Anne's age. I know she's 2 years older than Alyana, so I'll add 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, I'll subtract the total vlogs she's made from the total vlogs she aims to make:
72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

20% of $50 is 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, I'll add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount I paid.

Total amount = $50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, I ended up paying $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to get his initial share. $18 / 3 = $6.

Next, he added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

Then, he added another $10, bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21.

After that, he spent $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, resulting in $13 * 3 = $39.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we need to determine the amount he saves each day in the first half. 

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. The number of days in the second half will also be x, which is 15 days since April has 30 days.

Let's denote the amount saved in the first half as y. Then, the amount saved in the second half will be 2y.

The total amount saved in the first half is xy, and the total amount saved in the second half is 2xy. The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation: 3xy = 1125.

Since x is the number of days in the first half, and the total number of days in April is 30, we can write x + x = 30, which simplifies to 2x = 30, and x = 15.

Now we can substitute x = 15 into the equation 3xy = 1125 to find y: 3(15)y = 1125, which simplifies to 45y = 1125.

To find y, we divide both sides by 45: y = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

Next, we do the same for Jenny: 0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jairus' total and Jenny's total to see how much more Jairus will get than Jenny. The difference is $16 - $10 = $6.

"Let's break down the problem. Jeff and Brad are trying to divide 100 dollars between them, and Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of what Jeff and Brad get is 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

"Let's break down Elise's writing process step by step.

First, she writes the alphabet in full twice. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, this means she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters from the first two times, and the 13 letters from the third time. So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. So, the total number of letters she has written is 65 + 65 = 130.

10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. 
Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.
Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

We are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. 
So, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."

To find the average weight, we need to add up the weights of all three friends and divide by 3. The total weight is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds. 

The average weight of the three friends is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we need to add the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle the sun moves multiplied by the number of hours it moves.

The initial angle of the pyramid is 32 degrees. The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. It moves for 10 hours.

Angle moved by the sun = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees
Final angle from the ground to the sun = Initial angle + Angle moved by the sun
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

The final answer is: 82"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, James wants to buy birthday candles for his two sons. One of them is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. To figure out how many candles he needs, I'll add their ages together. The younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

So, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, I'll divide the total number of candles by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy.

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

Now, I'll multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total amount James spends on candles.

4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Hey there, let's break down Judy's reading habits. In the first week, she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Now, let's figure out how many pages she read in the first week. Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third of them, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches. Trevor ate a quarter of them, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to add the number of sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate and subtract that from the total number of sandwiches. Cody and Trevor ate a total of 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

Now, let's subtract the number of sandwiches they ate from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew. 

Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x. 

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7. 

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.
This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.
This simplifies to x = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for each of the next three teeth, she left $1.00, so that's a total of 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Hey, let's break down the problem. We have three teenagers playing soccer: Richie, Mark, and Anna. We know that Richie scored 80 goals. 

We also know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. To find out how many goals Mark scored, we subtract 20 from Richie's total: 80 - 20 = 60. So, Mark scored 60 goals.

Next, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. To find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 45 from Richie's total: 80 - 45 = 35. So, Anna scored 35 goals.

Now, let's add up the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers: 80 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Liam and Mitchell own competing lemonade stands across the street from each other. Liam bragged that he made $63 one weekend, but Mitchell laughed and said he sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece the same weekend.

To figure out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to find out how much Mitchell made and then subtract the amount Liam made. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so he made 21 * 4 = $84.

Now, we subtract the amount Liam made ($63) from the amount Mitchell made ($84) to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"Let's break down Peter's action figure purchases. He has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. This is a total of 4 days, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 * $5 = $20. Since he spent $20, he bought 20 / 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left. He has 5 days left, so the total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 50 / 2 = 25.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

The final answer is: 29"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Leah just got a new kitten, and I'm helping her figure out how much it's cost her so far. 

First, there's the spaying cost, which is $200. Then, there are the 3 vaccines, each costing $20. That's a total of 3 * $20 = $60 for the vaccines.

Next, the kitten had a bit of a mishap and broke 4 vases, each costing $12. So, that's 4 * $12 = $48 for the vases.

Now, let's add up all these costs: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Ford grows 40 roses every week and supplies them to local flower shops. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

First, let's add up the roses ordered by the flower shops per week: 
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

The final answer is: 100"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Katina has $3000 in her savings account. She removes $100 from the account every month. To find out how much money will be remaining within the account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount removed from the account and subtract it from the initial amount.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

The amount removed each month is $100, so the total amount removed in 24 months is 24 x $100 = $2400.

The initial amount in the account is $3000. 

The remaining amount in the account after 2 years is $3000 - $2400 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break down the costs and revenue for the food truck.

First, we need to calculate the cost of making 10 sandwiches. The bread costs $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

Next, we need to consider the cost of cheese and condiments. The food truck spends $30.00 on cheese and condiments for every 10 sandwiches. Since they're making 10 sandwiches, they'll need to buy one set of cheese and condiments, which costs $30.00.

The total cost is the sum of the bread cost and the cheese and condiments cost: $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. The food truck sells each sandwich for $7.00, and they're making 10 sandwiches. So, the total revenue is 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, which means she has a total of 3 * 64 = 192 crayons. She wants to melt 8 crayons together to make one muffin crayon, so the total number of muffin crayons she can make is 192 / 8 = 24.

Now, let's calculate how much money Kate can make by selling these muffin crayons. Each muffin crayon sells for $1.50, so Kate can make 24 * $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"I'd be happy to help you calculate the cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom.

To start, we need to find the area of the bedroom. Since it's a rectangle, we can multiply the length by the width. The length is 18 feet and the width is 12 feet, so the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the materials. The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592. The padding costs $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432. The total cost of the materials is $2592 + $432 = $3024.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the labor. The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864. The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344. The total cost of the labor is $864 + $7344 = $8208.

Finally, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the materials and the cost of the labor. The total cost is $3024 + $8208 = $11232.

The final answer is: $11232"

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out the final value of the number train.

Let's break it down step by step. The starting value of the number train is 20. 

First, we need to find half of the starting value, which is 20 / 2 = 10.

Next, we add the starting value to half of the number, so that's 20 + 10 = 30.

Now, we divide the resulting value by 5, which gives us 30 / 5 = 6.

Finally, we multiply the resulting value by the starting value minus 12, which is 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"So, let's figure this out. The boy has 5 cards, and his brother has 3 fewer cards than he does. To find out how many cards his brother has, we need to subtract 3 from 5. That's 5 - 3 = 2.

"To find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we need to determine the percentage by which it's off. The difference between the actual and set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18. 

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to find the temperature she should set the oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. To do this, we'll subtract 4% of 520 from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The temperature she should set the oven to is 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature she should set the oven to is 499.

The final answer is: 499"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Max wants to watch two movies this weekend. The first one is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, and the second one is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. To find out how many minutes it'll take him to watch both movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour to 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives us 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

Herb's house price is $76,000. To find 30% of this, we multiply $76,000 by 0.3. 
0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800

Now, we subtract $22,800 from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price.
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

The value of Juan's house is $53,200. To find the combined value of the two houses, we add Herb's house price and Juan's house price together.
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Total Judy brought: 12 + 24 = 36

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 
Friend's cups: 40
Friend's dishes: 44
Total friend brought: 40 + 44 = 84

Now, let's add the total number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend:

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will have. Since 90 single use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day. 

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

Now, we need to find the total number of days the contacts will last:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, he will use 2 contacts per day for 90 days, so he will use a total of 180 contacts. This means he will have 180 pairs of contacts.

The cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is:
2 boxes * $100/box = $200
10% discount = $200 * 0.10 = $20
$200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Tabitha agreed to pay John and Jill $10 an hour to help clean out her attic and basement.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"Hey there, let's break down Hannah's water intake. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. 

First, we need to calculate the total calories burned from her activities. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour.

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Now, we need to find out how many 200-calorie units there are in 1600 calories. We do this by dividing the total calories burned by 200.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Since each 200-calorie unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100.

8 * 100 = 800

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the jar contains red, blue, and green jelly beans, with a total of 4500 jelly beans. The note on the jar states that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (1% fewer than blue jelly beans) and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B (1% more than blue jelly beans).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500. Combining like terms, we get 3.01B = 4500.

To find the value of B, we divide both sides by 3.01:
B = 4500 / 3.01
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Jared is trying to boost his typing speed. He starts with 47 words per minute (WPM), then it increases to 52 WPM after some lessons. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, we need to find the average of the three measurements.

To do that, we need to add up all the measurements and divide by 3. Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM, his second typing speed is 52 WPM, and his third typing speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, let's add up all the measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given two scenarios: eating Cheerios for breakfast, which results in a weight loss of 1.25 pounds per week, and eating donuts for breakfast, which results in a weight gain of 1.75 pounds per week.

To find the difference in weight after 5 weeks, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option. 

Weight lost per week: -1.25 pounds
Weight gained per week: 1.75 pounds

Weight change after 5 weeks:
-1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds (lost)
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds (gained)

Now, let's find the difference in weight: 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

First, she invites 100 people via email. Each of these invited people says they'll also invite 2 of their friends. That's 100 + (100 * 2) = 300 people.

Then, Alex calls 10 of her friends to invite them too. 8 of them say they'll be bringing their spouses. So, that's 10 + 8 = 18 more people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people attending: 300 (from the email invites) + 18 (from Alex's friends) = 318. But we still need to account for Alex herself, so we add 1 to the total.

We know that the beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein. If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we need to find out how many grams of protein he gets per week.

First, we need to find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. Since a cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem. We're told that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This means we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's call Jerry's current age 'x'. 

The equation would be: x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get: -x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get: x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

"Let's break down George's dental work costs. Each implant has a base price of $2000, and he needs 2 of them, so that's 2 * $2000 = $4000. He also wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600, so we need to subtract that from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900. This is the amount he still needs to pay.

To find out how many hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a triangle, and we know that the sum of its angles is 180 degrees. One angle is twice the smallest angle, and another angle is three times the smallest angle.

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Then, the other two angles are 2x and 3x.

The sum of the three angles is x + 2x + 3x = 180. Combining like terms, we get 6x = 180.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees, and the other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

Since we're looking for the largest angle, we compare the three angles: 30, 60, and 90 degrees. The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"Hey, let's figure out how many gumballs Colby can buy. He has 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies. 

First, let's convert all the coins to cents. 8 quarters equal 8 x 25 cents, which is 200 cents. 6 dimes equal 6 x 10 cents, which is 60 cents. 14 nickels equal 14 x 5 cents, which is 70 cents. And 15 pennies equal 15 x 1 cent, which is 15 cents.

Now, let's add up all the cents: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

The final answer is: 69"
"Let's count the total number of legs in the pet store. 

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Jamaal is at the gym and he's been using an 8-pound weight. He decides to increase the weight by 50%. To do this, I need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Now, I add 4 pounds to 8 pounds to get the new weight. 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, Jamaal finds this weight too heavy, so he uses a weight that's two pounds lighter than this. To find the final weight, I subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down Steve's game collection over the 3 years.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 24 = 29 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 48 = 53 games in the third year.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve gets in 3 years: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how long it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles, we need to know its rate. We can find the rate by dividing the distance it traveled by the time it took.

Distance traveled: 1200 miles
Time taken: 3 hours

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now that we know the rate, we can find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. Since he makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, we can divide 120 by 2 to get the hourly rate. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates per hour for Ruiz.

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. It's given that she makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 

To find Marissa's hourly rate, we multiply Ruiz's hourly rate by 3/4.
60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds of chocolates per hour for Marissa.

Now that we have the hourly rates for both Ruiz and Marissa, we can find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

To find the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together, we add their individual totals.
720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"Let's break down Howard's arcade spending. On Monday, he spent $8. On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16. On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

To find the total amount he spent, we add these amounts together: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Since Howard originally had $100, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount to find out how much he has left: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down Patrick's lemonade sales. For the first four hours, he sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. To find the total amount earned, we multiply the number of cups sold by the price per cup.

Total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total amount earned in 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

Next, we look at the next two hours. Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total amount earned in 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, we add the total amount earned from both periods to find the overall earnings.
Total amount earned in 6 hours = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step. We know that every 2 miles, a car's tires rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, and each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing to be replaced.

First, we need to find out how many times the tires rotate in a month. To do this, we multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile.

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Now, we need to find out how many months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. We do this by dividing the total allowed rotations by the rotations per month.

Months before replacement = 10,440,000 rotations / 290,000 rotations/month
Months before replacement = 36 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = 36 months / 12
Years before replacement = 3 years

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the cost per pump of the shampoo, we need to first determine the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equal to 2400 cents. 

To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price, which is $25. To find 30% of $25, we multiply 0.3 by $25, which equals $7.5.

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt by subtracting the discount from the original price: $25 - $7.5 = $17.5.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the items. We add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.5 + $35 = $52.5.

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately. Now, let's find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase. We subtract the total cost from the amount Joe has: $50 - $52.5 = -$2.5.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.5"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Juan wants to add croissants to his bakery menu, and he's planning to make 4 dozen a day for a week. To figure out how much butter he'll need, we need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make and then multiply it by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

First, let's find the total number of croissants. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Now, we know there are 12 croissants in a dozen, so we multiply 28 dozen by 12 to get the total number of croissants:
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Next, we need to find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, so we multiply 336 by 1/4:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

So, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street: 194 * 490 = $95,060

To find how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to first find the cost to repave Monica's street and then subtract that from the cost to repave Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street: 194 * 150 = $29,100

Now, subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street: 
$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

John initially receives $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. After that, his research takes 10 times longer, which means it lasts for 5 * 10 = 50 months.

For the first 5 months, the cost is a straightforward $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months, the funding increases by 50% of the initial amount, which is $50,000. So, the new funding per month is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000.

To find the total cost for the remaining 45 months, we multiply the new funding by the number of months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Now, we add the cost for the first 5 months to the cost for the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The final answer is: $6,850,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces of beef tips. 
The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat consumed: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

First, let's figure out how many posts the group makes in a day. With 1000 members posting 3 posts each, that's 1000 * 3 = 3000 posts per day.

Now, March has 31 days. To find the total number of posts in March, we multiply the daily posts by the number of days: 3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93,000 posts.

The final answer is: 93000"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down Gary's laundry expenses. He does laundry twice a week, which means he does it 52 times in a year (since there are 52 weeks in a year). Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 52 * 20 = 1040 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the cost of water. A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of water used in a year is 1040 * $0.15 = $156.

The final answer is: $156"
"Let's break down the costs of all the items Scarlett bought.

First, she found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale. Then, she went to the pet store and bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each, which is a total of 2 x $2.50 = $5.00. Next, she bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each, which is 3 x $2.00 = $6.00. After that, she purchased 20 fish at $0.50 each, which is 20 x $0.50 = $10.00. Finally, she needed fish food that cost $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together:
$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Prince is a butcher who sells 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. His friend Bill gives him a bull that weighs 750kg. We need to figure out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

To do this, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day. Since he sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull's meat by the amount of meat Prince sells per day to find out how many days it will take to sell the meat. So, 750 / 150 = 5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row.

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Now, we know that one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. To find the number of seats occupied by the administrators, we multiply the total number of seats by 1/4.

Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Next, we need to find the number of remaining seats. We subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Now, we know that one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. To find the number of seats occupied by the parents, we multiply the remaining seats by 1/3.

Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Finally, we need to find the number of students. We subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.

Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

"Let's break down Jim's gum-chewing habits. He's at school for 8 hours, and he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours. So, we divide the total school hours by 2 to find out how many pieces he chews at school: 
8 hours / 2 = 4 pieces of gum

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces. 
Total pieces chewed so far: 4 + 2 = 6

Jim starts with a 20-pack of gum, so we subtract the pieces he's already chewed: 
20 - 6 = 14

Now, his sister asks for gum right before bed, and Jim gives her half of what's left. To find out how many pieces he gives her, we divide 14 by 2: 
14 / 2 = 7

Jim gives his sister 7 pieces, so we subtract that from the remaining gum: 
14 - 7 = 7

"Let's break down James' earnings from selling the used cars.

First, we need to find out the total cost of the cars. Since James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, the total cost is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we need to calculate the company's cost to acquire the cars. They paid 30% of the total cost, which is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

Now, let's find the profit from selling the cars. The profit is the total cost minus the company's cost, which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, we need to calculate James' commission on the profit. He gets a 10% commission, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500."
"I'm Kai, a surfer dude who's all about catching the gnarly waves. So, Tiffany's trying to figure out how many surfers can ride a big wave without wiping out. She's noticed that when the wave is over 30 feet, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. And, out of those who can stay upright, 60% are women. If there are 100 riders, I'm stoked to help her figure out how many dudes can stay upright on the wave.

First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25:
100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we need to find out how many women can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we need to find out how many men can stay upright. Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is:
25 - 15 = 10

"I'd be happy to help you find the total price for all three jewels.

First, let's figure out the price of the gold Jewell. Since it's 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell, and the diamond Jewell is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold Jewell as follows:

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Next, we know that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we can calculate the price of the silver Jewell as follows:

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to find the number of truck and rose stamps first.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Max bought: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Tom is driving at a speed of 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving 55 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, we need to find out how long it will take for Tom to catch up.

To do this, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. This is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.

Now, we can use the formula Time = Distance / Relative Speed to find the time it will take for Tom to catch up. The distance between them is 75 miles, and the relative speed is 15 mph.

Time = Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you out. So, Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60, and his parents said they won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class. There are 10 total classes, and we need to figure out how many Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again.

Let's break it down. If Manny attends all 10 classes at $6 per class, the total cost would be $60, which is within the limit. But if he misses some classes, the cost per class will increase. We want to find the maximum number of classes he can miss without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's say Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and y classes at $10 per class. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

6x + 10y = 60

Since Manny can't attend a fraction of a class, we need to find the maximum whole number of classes he can attend at $6 per class.

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 1, 6(1) + 10y = 60
6 + 10y = 60
10y = 54
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 6(2) + 10y = 60
12 + 10y = 60
10y = 48
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 6(3) + 10y = 60
18 + 10y = 60
10y = 42
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 4, 6(4) + 10y = 60
24 + 10y = 60
10y = 36
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

The maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jewel processes 50 customers per day. To find her weekly production, we need to multiply this number by the number of days in a week, which is 7. 

Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie's daily production is 50 * 2 = 100 customers.

Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, you want to know how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges in a grocery store. 

First, let's figure out the cost of 5 apples. Since 4 apples cost $5.20, we can multiply this by 5/4 to find the cost of 5 apples. 
Cost of 5 apples = $5.20 * (5/4) = $6.50

Next, we need to find the cost of 5 oranges. Since 3 oranges cost $3.30, we can multiply this by 5/3 to find the cost of 5 oranges.
Cost of 5 oranges = $3.30 * (5/3) = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the hole) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can find the total time it will take him to dig the hole by multiplying the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

The final answer is: 216"
"Let's break down the costs of Bill's new truck. The base price of the truck is $30,000. 

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500. 

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Hey there, let's break down Tim's new salary. He's getting a 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary, which is a $1,000 increase. So, his new monthly salary is $21,000.

He's also getting a bonus worth half a month's salary, which is $10,000.

To find his total monthly income, we add the new salary and the bonus: $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

Now, let's calculate his total annual income by multiplying his monthly income by 12: $31,000 * 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"Let's break down the costs of James' new wardrobe.

First, we need to find the cost of the suits. James bought 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, which is $750 * 1/5 = $150 per pair. Since James bought 10 pairs of dress pants, the total cost of the pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James bought 3 dress shirts for each of the 10 suits, so he bought a total of 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts. Each shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we add up the costs of the suits, pants, and shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Bill is trying to dig a well in his backyard. He can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and half that fast through clay, which means he digs 2 feet/hour through clay. 

To find the total time it will take him to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

Time to dig through soil: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours
Time to dig through clay: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

Total time to dig the well: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Fishio initially posted a selfie on Instagram and received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes increased to 70 times the initial number of likes. This means the number of likes after 3 weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140000.

However, we're not given the number of likes received in the 3 weeks between the initial post and the 3-week mark. Instead, we're told that Fishio received 20000 more new likes recently. To find the total number of likes after the 3-week mark, we need to subtract the initial likes from the likes at the 3-week mark: 140000 - 2000 = 138000.

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the total number of likes after the 3-week mark: 138000 + 20000 = 158000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. However, she got a $2 discount because she had a voucher. So, the total cost is:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate shot up to $30, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is:
20 * $30 = $600
The discount is 10% of $600, which is:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
So, the total cost with the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$540 - $398 = $142

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ariadne has a shop selling hats of two different colors, red and green. In a particular month, her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. 

Let's call the total sales from green hats in the first month ""x"". Then, the sales from red hats in the first month is $400, which is half of x, so x/2 = $400. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = $400 * 2 = $800.

So, in the first month, Ariadne's total sales from green hats were $800 and from red hats were $400.

The total sales in the first month are $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

To figure out how much was withheld from her wage, I'll calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received.

First, let's find out how much she should have had in her account if she received her full wage. 

Expected wage: $300
Initial amount in the account: $200
Expected total: $300 + $200 = $500

Since she actually has $420 in her account, I can find the difference between the expected total and the actual amount to determine how much was withheld.

Actual amount: $420
Expected total: $500
Withheld amount: $500 - $420 = $80

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Lori's having a party and she's making deviled eggs. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she's inviting 16 guests. To figure out how many eggs she needs, we first need to find out how many deviled egg halves her guests will eat in total.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves she needs to make. We already know she needs 48 deviled egg halves. 

Number of deviled egg halves needed: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day

"To find the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly hanger rental is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for a year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, so it is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for a year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we add the initial cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Lee has sheep and geese on his farm. We're given two pieces of information: the total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20.

Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can write the equation 4S + 2G = 70 to represent the total number of legs.

We also know that each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, so the total number of heads can be represented as S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Now, substitute G = 20 - S into the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

He usually buys a normal brand that costs $5 per pound, but his favorite brand is sold out, so he decides to buy a more expensive one that's 20% pricier. He needs a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds since he uses 1 pound per day. He also wants to grab a donut for $2.

First, let's figure out the cost of the more expensive coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive one is 20% more. To find 20% of $5, I'll multiply $5 by 0.2, which is $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the coffee. Since Roger needs 7 pounds, the cost is 7 * $6 = $42. Adding the cost of the donut, which is $2, we get $42 + $2 = $44.

Good days left = Total good days - Total good days already known
Good days left = 12 - 10
Good days left = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem. We're told that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, we can represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. 

The relationship between Janey's and Sally's books can be expressed as: Janey's books = 2x + 3. Since we know Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation 2x + 3 = 21.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 21 - 3, which simplifies to 2x = 18.

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x': x = 18 / 2, which equals 9.

So, Sally has 9 books."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mrs. Jameson's bamboo grows 30 inches a day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we first need to convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 4 + 8 = 12.

When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. This means there are a total of 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12 + 28 = 40.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means the total number of toys needed is 40 - 3 = 37.

The final answer is: 37"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we can calculate this as follows: (2/5) * 1200 = 480.

Now, we need to find out how much money was left after Dylan's investment. This is simply 1200 - 480 = 720.

Next, we need to find out how much Frances invested. Since Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, we can calculate this as follows: (2/3) * 720 = 480.

Now, we need to find out how much money was left after Frances' investment. This is simply 720 - 480 = 240.

So, Skyler's investment is 240.

The final answer is: $240"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Carol and Jennifer are sisters from Los Angeles who love collecting signatures from celebrities. They've been at it for five weeks, and now they're counting up their autograph books. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44. They want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of their summer break, which is three weeks away.

To figure out how many signatures they need to collect, I'll first add up the signatures they already have. Carol has 20, and Jennifer has 44, so together they have 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

Now, I'll subtract the signatures they already have from their goal of 100 to find out how many more they need. 100 - 64 = 36 signatures.

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, I'll divide the number of signatures they need by the number of weeks to find out how many they need to collect per week. 36 / 3 = 12 signatures per week.

The sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To figure out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to find the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows: 

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

We can then cross-multiply to solve for x:

6x = 96 * 36
6x = 3456
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: 576"
"Let's calculate the total weight of the 9 adults riding the elevator. 

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the difference between the total weight of the 9 adults and the maximum load.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the cookie situation. We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Max has 5 less cookies than Katarina, Max has 68 - 5 = 63 cookies.

Now, we need to figure out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 63 - 12 = 51 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, which means she has 63 + 23 = 86 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add up the number of cookies each person has: 
68 (Katarina) + 63 (Max) + 51 (Cookie Monster) + 86 (Summer) = 268

The final answer is: 268"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out the original length of Shania's dress.

Let's break it down. The final design is 140cm long, and that includes a 20cm lace trim at the bottom. To find the original length, we need to subtract the added length from the final length.

First, let's find the total added length. The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, and then 20cm was added. Let's call the original length 'x'. The extension is 50% of x, which is 0.5x. Adding 20cm to this extension gives us 0.5x + 20.

The final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: x + (0.5x + 20) = 140.

Combine like terms: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120.

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Chris has a two-speed lawn mower. He can mow his entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. Alternatively, he can mow the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode in 40 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to calculate the time it took for each mode and then add them together. To find the time for each mode, we multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school together. They need to get to the corner where the library is first, which takes 6 minutes. Then, it takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have.

First, let's add the time it takes to get to the fire station: 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have: 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes.

So, they have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"Let's break down Catherine's grocery shopping. She buys 1 kilo of apples for $4, 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, and 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo.

The cost of the apples is $4. 
The cost of the bananas is 2 * $2 = $4.
The cost of the oranges is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Greta and Celinda are baking cookies, and Greta bakes 30 of them. Celinda, on the other hand, bakes twice as many as Greta, which means she bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies they baked. Greta has 30 cookies, and Celinda has 60 cookies, so together they have 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

After baking, they eat 10 cookies while they're cooling, so we need to subtract those from the total. 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

So, there are 80 cookies left in the box.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, we need to find the age of one of the twins.

Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

We have two equations based on the given information:

1. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, the problem asks for the age of one of the twins, and since we have two twins, we need to find the age of the older twin.

The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, John wants to take a nap, but he needs to finish his homework first. He has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. He has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner.

First, let's convert 3 hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John spends on homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"I'd be happy to help you out. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for a total of $3.20. We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40. 

To find the cost of one candy, we need to subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. This is the cost of 4 candies. 

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Rong saves 20 coins every month, and Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we need to calculate 2/5 of 20, which is 8. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, John brought his dog to the vet, and it's time to pay the bill. The dog needs 2 vaccines, which cost $20 each, and a heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.

First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. That's 2 * $20 = $40.

Now, let's figure out the cost of the heartworm check. Since it's 60% of the total bill, we can represent the total bill as 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"Let's break down the cost of the fruits in the crate. 

First, we need to find the cost of one banana. Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs twice as much, which is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we find the cost of one orange, which is three times as much as a banana. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Mia's restaurant is expecting 42 adults and 15 babies tomorrow. They have 8 high chairs, and the number of regular chairs is 5 times the number of high chairs. To find out how many regular chairs they have, I'll multiply the number of high chairs by 5.

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed. We have 42 adults and 15 babies, so we'll add those together.

Total number of chairs needed = 42 + 15 = 57

Next, I'll find the total number of chairs available by adding the high chairs and regular chairs.

Total number of chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

To determine how many more chairs Mia needs, I'll subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs needed.

Number of chairs needed to be added = 57 - 48 = 9

Adam has 50 points. Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 0.3 by 50, which equals 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Now, let's find out how many points Tom has. We know he has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. To find 3 times 35, we multiply 3 by 35, which equals 105. So, Martha has 105 points.

The total points collected by the class is 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold of 400 points. 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know there are 8 males and 6 females in the group. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, we can determine the number of dumplings each male and female ate.

Each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

The total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

To find the total number of dumplings eaten, we add the number of dumplings eaten by females and males: 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, the local firefighters are trying to raise $6300 for their ""fill the boot"" fundraiser. After the first 3 hours, they've managed to collect $2100. To figure out how many hours they need to fundraise in total, we need to find out how much they raise per hour.

Let's calculate the amount they raise per hour. We can do this by dividing the total amount they've raised so far ($2100) by the number of hours they've been fundraising (3). That's $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they've already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they've already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Now, we need to find out what percentage of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

First, we need to find out how much of the 40% is used for industrial purposes. Since 80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes, we can calculate this by multiplying 40% by 0.8. 

0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%. This means 32% of the river's total water is used by the city for industrial purposes.

Now, to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 
40% - 32% = 8%.

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate of chocolate ice cream, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

Now, let's look at the production rate of vanilla ice cream. The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate of vanilla ice cream, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now that we have the production rates for both types of ice cream, we can calculate the total quarts produced in 48 hours. For chocolate ice cream, it would be 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts. For vanilla ice cream, it would be 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts.

To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream together: 2400 + 600 = 3000.

The final answer is: 3000"
"Let's break down Marcus' order. He bought 5 croissants at $3.00 each, which is a total of 5 * $3.00 = $15.00. 

He also bought 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, which is a total of 4 * $2.50 = $10.00.

Next, he purchased 3 mini quiches for $4.00 each, which is a total of 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.

Lastly, he bought 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each, which is a total of 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount, we multiply $50.00 by 0.10, which is $5.00.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Erin wants to buy ice cream from a parlor that's offering a deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 free. Each scoop costs $1.50. Erin has $6.00 to spend. 

To figure out how many scoops she can get, I'll divide the amount of money she has by the cost of each scoop. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so Erin can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. 

To take advantage of the deal, Erin should buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops. 

The remaining $1.50 can be used to buy 1 more scoop, making it a total of 4 scoops.

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two people, Ginger and Amy, who both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day.

To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount. Two weeks is equal to 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Now, let's calculate how much candy each person has left. Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Mr. Boarden is remodeling his bathroom, and he needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot. He's got a 36 sq ft bathroom, and he wants to cover two thirds of it. 

To find the area he needs to cover, we calculate two thirds of 36. That's (2/3) * 36. Multiplying first, we get 2 * 36 = 72. Then, we divide by 3, which gives us 72 / 3 = 24.

So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 sq ft. For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 sq ft, he would need 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"Hey, let's break down James' blueberry adventure. He spent $20 to go blueberry picking, and then it cost him $1.5 per pound for the blueberries. He picked 30 pounds, so the total cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

Now, let's compare this to buying the blueberries at the store. The store sells them for $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds, so the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store: $75 (store price) - $65 (picking price) = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the total amount of money the company paid, we need to first find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. The new price is 10% higher than the original price. 

10% of $700 is 0.1 x 700 = $70. 

The new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers. 

The total amount is 500 x $770 = $385,000.

The final answer is: $385,000"
"Let's break down the ingredients in John's omelet. He's using 6 eggs, 2 oz of cheese, and an equal amount of ham. 

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. Since each egg is 75 calories, 6 eggs would be 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

Next, we have the cheese. With 2 oz of cheese at 120 calories per oz, that's 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

Lastly, we have the ham. Since there's an equal amount of ham as cheese, that's also 2 oz. With 40 calories per oz, that's 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Now, let's add up the calories from all the ingredients: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the pencils and erasers. The cost of 6 pencils is 6 * $0.50 = $3. The cost of 8 erasers is 8 * $0.25 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and erasers together: $3 + $2 = $5.

Since you paid $10, the change would be $10 - $5 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 people who applied receive interviews, we can calculate this as follows:

30% of 100 = 0.3 * 100 = 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we need to find out how many of those who receive interviews receive a job offer. Since 20% of those who receive interviews receive a job offer, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, we need to find out how many of those who receive a job offer accept the position. Since a third of those who receive a job offer accept the position, we can calculate this as follows:

A third of 6 = 6 / 3 = 2 people accept the position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice and gave some to her cousin and brother. To find out how many kilograms she gave away, we need to know how many sacks she gave away first.

She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. 
Total sacks given away = 3 + 4 = 7 sacks

Since there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, we need to multiply the total sacks given away by the weight of each sack.

Total kilograms given away = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

The final answer is: 175"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops this week. To find out how many boxes of cereal she bought in total, we need to add those numbers together. 3 + 5 = 8 boxes.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal. To find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we need to subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week. That's 8 - 4 = 4.

"Let's break down Helga's clog dancing into two scenarios: when her arms are down and when her arms are up.

When her arms are down, Helga can tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute and her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute. This means she taps a total of 550 times per minute. Since she dances for 3 minutes with her arms down, she taps a total of 550 * 3 = 1650 times.

When her arms are up, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute for each foot. This means she taps a total of 400 times per minute. Since she dances for 2 minutes with her arms up, she taps a total of 400 * 2 = 800 times.

To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we add the total taps from both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"Let's break down the situation. Ron is worried about a pothole in front of his house that's going to cause $450 worth of damage to his car if it's not fixed. However, if he decides to fix it himself, the city council will fine him $120 for unauthorized road maintenance. On top of that, he'll need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of the asphalt. Since he needs 3 buckets, that's 3 * $25 = $75.

Now, we add the fine to the cost of the asphalt: $75 + $120 = $195.

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $195. To find out how much money Ron saves, we subtract this from the total damage the pothole will cause: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is: $255"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a total of 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs in the restaurant. 

First, we need to find the total number of chairs sent for repair. We know that 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs were sent. So, the total number of chairs sent for repair is 20 + 13 = 33.

Now, let's find the total number of chairs left. We can do this by subtracting the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs. 

Total chairs left = Total normal chairs - 20 + Total baby chairs - 13
Total chairs left = 170 - 20 + 23 - 13
Total chairs left = 150 + 10
Total chairs left = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people in total, including Bryce and his 4 friends.

Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. To find the total number of slices they ate, we can multiply the number of people by the fraction of the pizza they ate, and then multiply by the number of slices per pizza:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

40 slices - 24 slices = 16 slices

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

Total number of slices = 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices
Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 16 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. Now, we need to find out how long it takes for a dog to eat the same number of sausages.

Since the dog eats the sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time by multiplying the cat's time by 2/3.

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. We can do this by adding their times and dividing by 2.

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. To make calculations easier, we'll convert this to just inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply 8 by 12 to get 96 inches. Adding 4 inches to that gives us a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows and 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

First, we need to find the total number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. To find the total number of windows, we multiply the number of cars by the number of windows per car: 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we multiply the total number of windows by 1/4: (1/4) * 256 = 64.

Next, we need to find the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. To find the total number of windows, we multiply the number of cars by the number of windows per car: 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we multiply the total number of windows by 3/4: (3/4) * 64 = 48.

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars: 64 + 48 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to first calculate the total number of blue spools. We have 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools, so the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60.

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. We have 15 light blue, 45 dark blue, 40 light green, and 50 dark green spools, so the total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

At 8:00, 5000 people lined up at a polling station. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. To find out how many people voted by midday, we multiply 2/5 by 5000.

2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, we need to find out how many people were left after midday. That would be the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by midday.

5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were left after midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. To find out how many people voted by 16:00, we multiply 2/3 by the number of people left after midday.

2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

Now, we need to find out how many people had not voted by 16:00. That would be the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.

5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000

First, we need to figure out how many pieces of gum he'll chew in 30 days. That's 4 pieces a day multiplied by 30 days, which is 4 * 30 = 120 pieces.

Now, we know a pack of gum has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we divide the total number of pieces he'll chew by the number of pieces in a pack: 120 / 15 = 8.

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, we're trying to figure out how many boxes of graham crackers we need for a s'mores party. We know that 9 kids want 2 smores each and 6 adults will eat 1 s'more each.

First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed. For the kids, that's 9 * 2 = 18 smores. And for the adults, it's 6 * 1 = 6 smores. So, in total, we need 18 + 6 = 24 smores.

Now, each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores. To find out how many sleeves we need, we divide the total number of smores by 8. That's 24 / 8 = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves by 3 to find out how many boxes we need. That's 3 / 3 = 1 box.

So, we need 1 box of graham crackers for the party.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Dora's age is 15 years. To find her father's age, we need to calculate eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Dora's father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8 
= 2 * 15 + 8 
= 30 + 8 
= 38 years.

Now, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4 
= 38 - 4 
= 34 years.

To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their individual ages together.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age 
= 15 + 38 + 34 
= 87 years.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Cecelia went to the milk store and found out that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. If a gallon jar costs $5, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

First, we need to find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 
Cost of a gallon jar = $5
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, we can find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.
Total cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5 = $50
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48

To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.
Total amount of money Cecelia spent = $50 + $48 = $98

Now, let's find the total number of students who like to either play video games or play music. 
Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball) 
= 50 - (10 + 5)
= 50 - 15
= 35

Since we know that students who like to play music = 10, students who like to play video games = students who like to play video games or music - students who like to play music

1/3 of 12 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, 4 birds were scared away. Now, we subtract 4 from the initial number of birds: 
12 - 4 = 8

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 
8 + 20 = 28

The final number of birds in the backyard is 28.

For the first amusement park, the cost for adults is 2 * $26 = $52, and the cost for children is 2 * $12 = $24. Adding these together, the total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

For the second amusement park, the cost for adults is 2 * $14 = $28, and the cost for children is 2 * $10 = $20. Adding these together, the total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

To find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks, we subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park: $76 - $48 = $28.

The final answer is: $28"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The tomato vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day and used to buy them for $0.5 each. Now, he gets a new vendor who sells them for $0.4 each. 

First, we need to find the daily savings. To do this, we'll calculate the cost of buying 500 tomatoes at the old price and the new price, then subtract the new cost from the old cost.

Old cost = 500 * 0.5
Old cost = 250

New cost = 500 * 0.4
New cost = 200

Daily savings = Old cost - New cost
Daily savings = 250 - 200
Daily savings = 50

Now, we need to find the weekly savings. Since there are 7 days in a week, we'll multiply the daily savings by 7.

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = 50 * 7
Weekly savings = 350

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Sean has 56 marbles.
- Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find Cal's marbles by doubling Sean's: 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.
- Now, we know Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so we multiply Sean's marbles by 4: 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: 224 (Carl) + 112 (Cal) = 336.

The final answer is: 336"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, we have 54 students who need to be divided into groups of equal size. But here's the twist - the activity actually requires 12 groups. To figure out how many more groups we need, let's first find out how many students each group should have.

We divide the total number of students by the number of groups we want to have. 

54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group

Now, we know that we need 12 groups in total. To find out how many students we need in total, we multiply the number of groups by the number of students per group.

12 groups * 9 students per group = 108 students

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find out how many more students we need to reach 108.

108 students - 54 students = 54 students

Now, we know we need 54 more students. Since each group has 9 students, we need to find out how many more groups we need.

54 students / 9 students per group = 6 groups

So, we need 6 more groups to reach the required 12 groups.

The final answer is: 6"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Candy has a chair rental business, and I'm here to help figure out how many chairs she'll rent out in two 4-week months.

Let's break it down. During the weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day, and on weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. We need to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months.

In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. 

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekend days: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, let's calculate the total chairs rented in two 4-week months. There are 8 weeks in total (2 months * 4 weeks/month), so we multiply the total chairs rented in a week by 8:
500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"Let's break down the sequence of events to find out how many bananas Gunther had at the end.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas, so the number of bananas left is 48 / 2 = 24.

Gunther added 25 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 24 + 25 = 49.

Arnold stole 12 bananas, so the number of bananas left is 49 - 12 = 37.

Gunther added 6 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 37 + 6 = 43.

The final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Jenna has 4 roommates and the electricity bill comes out to be $100 every month. To figure out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to divide the monthly bill by the number of roommates and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's divide the monthly bill by the number of roommates:

$100 / 4 = $25 per roommate per month.

Now, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 to get the yearly amount:

$25 * 12 = $300 per roommate per year.

The final answer is: $300"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Jeff owns a catering company and he sent out 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for a party. When they were returned, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. Let's figure out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now.

First, we need to calculate the total number of glasses and plates he sent out. Since a dozen is 12, we multiply the number of dozens by 12.

- Glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- Plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items:
- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

Glasses left: 96 - 10 = 86
Plates left: 48 - 6 = 42

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

The final answer is: $\boxed{86}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30 small stickers, we multiply 0.9 by 30, which equals 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. To find 50% of 40 large stickers, we multiply 0.5 by 40, which equals 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

Next, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers, 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons. To find the total number of buttons she has, we add these together: 3 + 20 + 27 + 20 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the council has 33 members and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. 

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. Let's break down the sizes they need.

First, 11 students need extra-small shirts. Then, twice as many students need small shirts as extra small, which is 2 * 11 = 22 students. Next, four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so that's 22 - 4 = 18 students. After that, half as many students need size large as size medium, which is 18 / 2 = 9 students. Finally, six more students need size extra-large than large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 students.

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

The final answer is: 75"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, you've got a bag that's marked at $140, and it's got a 5% discount. To find out how much you'll pay after the discount, I'll calculate the discount amount first.

The discount is 5% of the original price, which is $140. To find 5% of $140, I multiply $140 by 0.05.

Discount = $140 * 0.05 = $7

Now, I'll subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price.

Final price = Original price - Discount
Final price = $140 - $7
Final price = $133

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win the big race. To find this number, we multiply 0.2 by 50, which equals 10 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, the remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40.

60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. To find this number, we multiply 0.6 by 40, which equals 24 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. Since 24 people think horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 40 - 24 = 16 people.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
2. One third of the Pomeranians are girls.
3. There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and we are given that this number is 6. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we found that there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for the three houses is 250. The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, and the third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles, and the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"

First, we need to find out how many pears George has. To do that, we'll calculate 45% of the number of bananas. 

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90 pears

Now, we add the number of bananas and pears to get the total number of fruits.

Total number of fruits = number of bananas + number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 90
Total number of fruits = 290

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to determine how many books he read in that hour.

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can find Ahmed's total by dividing Ezra's total by 2. 

Ahmed's books = 300 / 2 = 150

Now, we know Ezra will read 300 + 150 = 450 books in total.

To find the total number of books both Ezra and Ahmed read, we add their individual totals together.

Total books read by Ahmed = 150
Total books read by Ezra = 450
Total books read by both = 150 + 450 = 600

First, let's figure out how much money he makes from selling the eggplants. Since he sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, we need to find out how much he should make from selling the corn. To do that, we subtract the amount he makes from eggplants ($60) from his total goal ($135). This gives us $135 - $60 = $75.

Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, we need to divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25) to find out how much he should sell each ear for.

$75 / 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot. 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to understand how the scores are calculated. Ava and Emma receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on, 5 points for each berry they collect, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level.

We're given that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, but finishes the level 4 seconds slower. 

Let's assume Emma's score is x. 

Emma's score is x. 

Ava's enemy score is 10 times the number of enemies she jumps on, which is 10(x + 8). 
Ava's berry score is 5 times the number of berries she collects, which is 5(x + 3). 
Ava's timer score is 30 times the number of seconds left on the timer, which is 30(60 - (x + 4)).

Now, let's calculate Ava's total score: 10(x + 8) + 5(x + 3) + 30(60 - (x + 4)).

Simplifying the expression, we get: 10x + 80 + 5x + 15 + 30(56 - x).

Combine like terms: 10x + 5x + 30(56 - x) + 80 + 15.

Distribute the 30: 10x + 5x + 1680 - 30x + 80 + 15.

Combine like terms: -15x + 1775.

Emma's score is x. 

The difference in their scores is (-15x + 1775) - x.

Combine like terms: -16x + 1775.

However, we don't know the value of x. We need to find the value of x to calculate the difference.

Since we don't have any information about the value of x, we can assume that the difference in their scores is the difference in their enemy and berry scores, and the difference in their timer scores.

The difference in their enemy scores is 8.
The difference in their berry scores is 3.
The difference in their timer scores is (60 - (x + 4)) - 60 = -4.

The difference in their scores is 8 + 3 - 4 = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. 

First, we need to find the total cost of these two pizzas. Since they cost 30 dollars each, the total cost is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. He bought some more fish from the pet store, and after adding them to his pond, he found that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O. The total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so we can write the equation: W + O = 17.

We also know that after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be represented by the equation: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

Now, let's solve the second equation for O: O = 2(4 + W) - 3 = 8 + 2W - 3 = 5 + 2W.

Substitute this expression for O into the first equation: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combine like terms: 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week.

First, we need to calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the total daily distance is 5 miles * 2 (to and from work) = 10 miles/day.

Now, we multiply the daily distance by the number of working days: 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we need to find out how much fuel Andy's car consumes per week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon (MPG), so we divide the total weekly distance by the fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost per week by multiplying the amount of fuel consumed by the price of gas: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"Hey, let's break down the problem. Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt. We need to find out how much she spent on lunch.

First, let's calculate the value of the quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 140 quarters by $0.25 to get the total value of the quarters: 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, we need to find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie had ten twenties, which is a total of $200. Since she spent 3/5 of the twenties, we multiply $200 by 3/5 to get the amount she spent: 3/5 * $200 = $120.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent to find the total amount of money she paid for lunch: $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Ricardo has 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, and each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants: 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants together to find the total number of fruits: 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

The final answer is: 142"
"Let's break down the sales of TVs at Samwell's appliances store. We know that one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, John is trying to raise money for a school trip, and the school has agreed to cover half of the cost. The trip costs $300. To figure out how much John is missing, I'll first calculate how much the school will cover. 

Half of the trip cost is $300 / 2 = $150. The school will cover $150, and John has $50. To find out how much John is missing, I'll subtract the amount he has from the amount the school will cover:

Amount John is missing = Amount school will cover - Amount John has
= $150 - $50
= $100

The final answer is: $100"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help. So, Carson lives in an old house where the pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees. Every log of wood he burns heats the house up by 5 degrees. If it was 45 degrees during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, we need to figure out how many logs he needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing.

First, let's find out the temperature during the night. Since it's 33 degrees colder during the night, we subtract 33 from 45: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Now, we need to find the temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature. That's 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, we have a scavenger hunt competition with 90 people, and they need to be divided into groups for it to start. Each group has 9 people, and 3/5 of the groups bring back 2 seashells each. Let's figure out how many seashells they brought back in total.

First, we need to find out how many groups there are. We can do this by dividing the total number of people by the number of people per group.

Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Now, we need to find out how many groups brought back seashells. We know that 3/5 of the groups did this.

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Next, we need to find the total number of seashells. We know that each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells.

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a train with 172 people on it. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:

Next, 13 people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

Finally, at the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

So, there are 100 people on the train.

The final answer is: 100"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Damien's got a pretty cool thing going on with his bottle cap currency. He finds 10 bottle caps a day on his way home, and each one is worth 25 cents. To figure out how much money he makes in a 30-day month, we need to do some simple math.

First, let's calculate how much he makes in a day. If he finds 10 bottle caps and each one is worth 25 cents, that's:

10 * 0.25 = 2.50

So, Damien makes $2.50 per day. Now, let's multiply that by the number of days in the month:

2.50 * 30 = 75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. 150% of $20 is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. For 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

Let's see... we have 12 female lions, which is a pretty standard number for our pride. However, we have half as many male lions as female lions, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. And then there are the lion cubs – we have 14 of them, which is always a joy to see.

To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, I just need to add up the numbers: 12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32.

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Mike's looking for a new pair of jeans, and he's found his favorite brand on sale for 25% off. The original price is $40. Let's calculate the discount and see how much he'll have left over after paying with a $50 bill.

First, we need to find the discount amount. To do that, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (25% or 0.25). 

Discount = 0.25 * $40
Discount = $10

Now, let's find the price after the discount:
Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

Now, let's find out how much money Mike will have left over:
Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. To find the total salary for each month, we multiply the number of employees by the salary per employee:
260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Carrie is planning the caroling schedule for the choir. They plan to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and ""Jingle Bells"" once. 

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, and ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long. To find the total time they'll be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

Time for ""Deck the Halls"" = 150 seconds
Time for ""Jingle Bells"" = 240 seconds

Total time for ""Deck the Halls"" = 2 * 150 = 300 seconds
Total time for ""Jingle Bells"" = 240 seconds

Total caroling time = Total time for ""Deck the Halls"" + Total time for ""Jingle Bells""
Total caroling time = 300 + 240
Total caroling time = 540 seconds

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Billy's hourly wage after his raises. He was initially paid $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Then, on his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Sally's hourly wage. Her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Next, we need to find their total earnings after working 20 hours. Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230. Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question.

To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30% or more.

"Hey there, let's break down Kris's gaming progress. She's trying to earn a video game achievement that requires a total of 30 hours of playtime.

First, let's calculate how many hours Kris played in 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and she plays for half an hour every day. So, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate how many hours Kris played in 1 week. There are 7 days in a week, and she plays for 2 hours every day. So, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Now, let's add up the total hours Kris has played: 7 hours in 2 weeks and 14 hours in 1 week. That's a total of 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two cars on the highway, with the first car traveling at 60 miles per hour and the second car passing it at 70 miles per hour. We want to find out how many miles will separate them after 2 hours.

First, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. The distance traveled is equal to the speed multiplied by the time. So, for the first car:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

For the second car:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

Now, we need to find the distance between the two cars. This is simply the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours is 20 miles."
"I'm Kai, and I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total cost of the ring, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the 30% premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600, and the cost of the gold is $300. So, the total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we need to calculate the 30% premium. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.3: 0.3 * $900 = $270.

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold: $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have the results of the standardized test for three different grades: third-graders, fourth-graders, and fifth-graders.

First, we know that 340 out of 500 third-graders passed the test. To find the pass rate for third-graders, we can divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(340 / 500) * 100 = 68%

Next, we're given that 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed the test. To find the pass rate for fourth-graders, we can divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(40 / 100) * 100 = 40%

Now, we're told that the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders. Since the pass rate of fourth-graders is 40%, the pass rate of fifth-graders is 2 * 40% = 80%. We also know that there are 400 fifth-graders, so the number of students who passed is 80% of 400:
(80/100) * 400 = 320

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(700 / 1000) * 100 = 70%

The final answer is: 70"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Milo is making a mosaic with glass chips, and it takes 12 chips to make every square inch. He has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. He wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. Let's figure out how long he can make it.

First, we need to find out how many chips Milo has in total. He has 2 bags, and each bag has 72 chips, so:

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we know it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch of the mosaic. So, we can find out how many square inches Milo can make with 144 chips:

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we need to find out how long it can be. We know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), so we can find the length:

Area = length * width
12 = length * 3
length = 12 / 3
length = 4

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 4 students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

Next, 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party. To do this, we add the amount of tea drank to the amount of tea left. 

The amount of tea left is 10 quarts. 

Total tea at the beginning = 38 (tea drank) + 10 (tea left) = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4. 

48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies. Then, he sold 150 of them. To find out how many candies he has left, we need to subtract the number of candies sold from the initial number of candies. 

100 (initial candies) - 150 (candies sold) = -50 (candies left)

However, we can't have a negative number of candies, so this means Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold. 

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. Now, we need to find the total number of candies he has. 

100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 (total candies)

Since he sold 150 candies, we need to subtract this from the total number of candies to find out how many he still needs to sell. 

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 (candies left to sell)

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We start with 10 students at the beginning of the year. Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

Now, we need to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial number of students. To do this, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Felix is making some extra cash by rescuing stuff from trees. He charges 25 cents for every branch he has to climb. He made a total of $105 during the week. Let's figure out how many branches he climbed on average per day.

To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"I'm Kai, and I'm happy to help you with this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Rose starts by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each. That's a total of 3 * 5 = 15 petals.

Next, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. That's a total of 4 * 6 = 24 petals.

Then, she adds 5 flowers with 4 petals each. That's a total of 5 * 4 = 20 petals.

Finally, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. That's a total of 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

However, Rose drops 1 petal from each set of flowers, so we need to subtract 4 petals from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals.

The final answer is: 97"
"Let's figure out how many S'mores each kid can have. First, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean make their S'mores and drop some on the ground.

John and DeSean each make 9 S'mores, so together they use 18 marshmallows. They also drop 3 marshmallows, so in total, they use 21 marshmallows. 

Now, let's subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since there are 2 kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have.

Marshmallows left = 14
Number of kids = 2
S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total time played by each person. Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. 

The friend who is better than Jack plays for 1.5 times the time, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played is 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

The total amount of money used is 840 * 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, John went to the market and bought some animals. He bought 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. Let's calculate how much he spent in total.

First, we need to find the cost of the goats. Since he bought 3 goats at $500 each, the total cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.

Next, we need to find the cost of the cows. He bought 2 cows at $1500 each, so the total cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we just need to add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount John spent. $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

First, let's add up the cupcakes he already has: 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which gives us 8 cars sold.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

So, Joe gives away a total of 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we know that 20 students worked together to raise this amount, and each student earned the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we need to divide the total amount raised by the number of students.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on a particular day. Then, she walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day to Hollock valley shores. To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

So, let's break it down step by step. Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total number of cars 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 of the cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

To find the number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars. So, 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were present when he got out of class for the lunch break, which is 35.

Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Now, let's calculate his weekly earnings. Since he works a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7.

Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Sasha and Julie are best friends playing on opposing basketball teams. They have two practice games scheduled. In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game.

To find out how many points Julie scored in the first game, we subtract 4 from Sasha's score: 14 - 4 = 10 points.

Now, let's move on to the second game. Sasha struggles during away games, and their second match was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we need to find out how much he produces in the fourth week. To do that, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000.

First, let's calculate the number of additional items Angela needs. For mirrors, she needs 6 - 4 = 2 more. For chandeliers, she needs 2 - 1 = 1 more. For pictures, she needs 20 - 10 = 10 more.

The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost of the additional items is 2 * $15.00 (mirrors) + 1 * $15.00 (chandelier) + 10 * $15.00 (pictures) = $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the initial installation package to the cost of the additional items. The total cost is $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

Pompei, a novice, can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay, a skilled warrior, can lift 12 times higher than Pompei, which means Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami, a formidable foe, can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto, the young ninja, can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Now, let us convert these inches to feet, for the ninja's strength is not measured in inches, but in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide 480 by 12.

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Mason is on a bike journey at a rate of 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours, takes a break, and then goes on for another 6 hours. To find the total distance he's traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to cross the highway. To find out how long it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway, we need to multiply the total time by the number of kangaroos. 

So, one kangaroo would take 18 * 3 = 54 hours to travel across the highway.

Now, we're told that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means they'll take twice as long to cover the same distance. Since there are four turtles, we need to multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2 and then by 4.

So, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is 54 * 2 * 4 = 432 hours.

However, we can simplify this calculation by first multiplying 54 by 2, which equals 108, and then multiplying 108 by 4, which equals 432."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Kora made 20 dishes.
- Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
- Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of dishes they made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"Let's break down Erika's situation. She's saving for a new laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price of the new one will be reduced by $200, making it $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has some savings in her purse and has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80 to help her out. To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's help.

The total amount of money Erika received is $150 (her payment) + $80 (her mom's help) = $230.

Since Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs: $400 (price of the laptop) + $50 (extra money needed) = $450.

Now, we can find out how much money Erika had in her purse initially by subtracting the amount she received from the total amount she has: $450 (total amount she has) - $230 (amount she received) = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Adam wants to eat some sliced apples. He's got a plan to slice 3 large apples and 5 small apples. 

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Let's calculate the total number of slices he'll get from each type of apple.

For the large apples, 3 x 5 = 15 slices.
For the small apples, 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, let's add them together to get the total number of slices: 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam decides to eat 15 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total: 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day with the current milk production rate.

The current milk production rate is 5 liters per cow per day. To find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can divide 25 by 5.

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to have 5 cows in total.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. 
1/6 * 12 = 2 millimeters

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. 
2/3 * 12 = 8 millimeters

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. 
1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions together: 
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. He's got some cash to help him out - $5000 from working on weekends and an extra $200 from his brother. Let's see how much more he needs.

First, we need to add up the cost of the car and the phone. That's $10000 + $800, which equals $10800.

Now, let's add up the money Gabriel already has. He's got $5000 from working and $200 from his brother, so that's a total of $5200.

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the items. That's $10800 - $5200, which equals $5600.

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"So, Thea bought a hat from a craftsman in Bali for $70. She paid with four $20 bills. To find out how much change she got, we need to calculate the total amount she gave the craftsman and then subtract the cost of the hat.

The total amount she gave the craftsman is 4 * $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount: $80 - $70 = $10.

Thea got $10 as change."
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, let's break down Craig's expenses. He has 2 twenty dollar bills, which is a total of $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so that's 6 x $2 = $12 spent on squirt guns.

Then, he buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, which is 3 x $3 = $9 spent on water balloons.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he must have collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"Let's break down the information given: there are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. 5 of them are good at math only, and 8 of them perform well in English only. The rest are good at both math and English.

To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English. The students good at both math and English are counted in both the math only and English only groups, so we need to add them to the students good at math only to get the total number of students good at math.

First, let's find the number of students good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total, and 5 are good at math only and 8 are good at English only, the number of students good at both math and English is 20 - (5 + 8) = 7.

Now, we can find the total number of students good at math by adding the students good at math only and those good at both math and English: 5 + 7 = 12.

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Vicki is planning a pop concert at her high school, and she's got a 2-hour show lined up. Each group gets 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit. That's a total of 10 minutes per group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. But there's a 10-minute intermission, so we need to subtract that from the total time. That leaves us with 110 minutes for performances.

Now, let's divide the total performance time by the time each group takes: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, the answer is 11 groups can perform in the concert.

The final answer is: 11"
"I'd be happy to help you with that problem. 

To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

After 1 year, Brenda will have: $300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525
After 2 years, Brenda will have: $525 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $750
After 3 years, Brenda will have: $750 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $975

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20. 

To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts: 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. This difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, a farmer has 900 eggs and he's placing them on a tray that holds 30 eggs each. If he sells each tray for $2.5, let's calculate how much he'll earn.

First, we need to figure out how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs. To do that, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.

Number of trays = 900 / 30
= 30

Now, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find out the total earnings.

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many goats were sold from Farm Y. Since Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, and he sold 10 goats from Farm X, we can calculate the number of goats sold from Farm Y by multiplying the number of goats sold from Farm X by 2. 
Number of goats sold from Farm Y = 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we know that Mr. Smith sold 20 goats from Farm Y. To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm Y.
Number of goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of goats left in Farm X. We know that Mr. Smith initially had 55 goats in Farm X and he sold 10 goats. To find the number of goats left in Farm X, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm X.
Number of goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45

Finally, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y.
Total number of goats left = 45 + 25 = 70

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and he spends a total of $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

Since James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, let's divide the total amount spent on shoes per year ($2640) by the number of pairs bought per year (24):

$2640 / 24 = $110

The final answer is: $110"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two types of baskets: green food and red food. The green food basket costs $25, and the red food basket costs $18. We're buying 3 baskets of each.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food: 3 * $25 = $75. Next, we calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food: 3 * $18 = $54. Now, we add these two costs together to get the total cost before any discounts: $75 + $54 = $129.

However, we also get a discount for buying the red food baskets. For each red food basket, we get $2 off, and we're buying 3 of them. So, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6. Now, we subtract this discount from the total cost: $129 - $6 = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find out how long it takes to clean half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to determine the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms in total, we'll divide that by 2.

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Now, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. To find the total time, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack.

First, let's find the total number of glue sticks required. There are 27 students in the class, and each student needs 2 glue sticks. So, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Now, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack, which is 8. 54 / 8 = 6.75.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons, so we add that to the amount from the second day: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to add the amounts from all three days: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a plague that infects people, and each infected person infects six others every day. We want to find out how many people are infected after three days, starting with ten people.

Day 1: 
- Initially, there are 10 people infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new people are infected.
- Total people infected after Day 1: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2: 
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total people infected after Day 2: 70 (previous) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 490.

Day 3: 
- The 360 people infected on Day 2 infect 360 * 6 = 2160 new people.
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total people infected after Day 3: 490 (previous) + 2160 (new) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 3070.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Jennifer bought 12 oranges from the market. She gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, and her only boy got 3 oranges. To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children.

She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. 
She gave her only boy 3 oranges. 
So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges initially. 
To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges: 
12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down the problem. Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves in the oven every hour. Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, and she sells each slice for 50 cents.

She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. In that time, she baked 2 loaves per hour, so she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Since each loaf is cut into 8 slices, she baked a total of 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Now, let's convert the price per slice to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can divide the price per slice by 100 to get the price in dollars. So, 50 cents is equal to 0.5 dollars.

Now, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised:

80 slices * 0.5 dollars/slice = 40 dollars

However, I made a mistake in my calculation. Let's redo it.

80 slices * 0.5 dollars/slice = 40 dollars

The final answer is: $40"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Gretchen has some coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, I can help figure out the total number of coins she has.

Let's start by finding out how many silver coins she has. If there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and she has 70 gold coins, then the number of silver coins must be 70 - 30 = 40.

Now that we know she has 40 silver coins and 70 gold coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding them together: 40 + 70 = 110.

The final answer is: 110"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's get to the problem at hand. George, a grade six teacher, ordered 600 burritos for the sixth-grade class picnic. There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given ten burritos. Mr. George also had a few burritos, eating 20 of them.

First, let's figure out how many burritos the students ate. Since there were 50 students and each student got 10 burritos, we multiply 50 by 10 to get the total number of burritos eaten by the students. That's 50 * 10 = 500.

Now, we need to add the burritos Mr. George ate to the total. He had 20 burritos. So, we add 500 (burritos eaten by students) + 20 (burritos eaten by Mr. George) = 520.

To find the number of leftover burritos, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the initial number of burritos. That's 600 (initial burritos) - 520 (burritos eaten) = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink.

Let's start by looking at the information given. The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Next, we know that the rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, let's add up the number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We can express the relationship between Sofie and Anne as S = A + 25. We can also express the relationship between Anne and Fawn as A = F - 12.

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25. This simplifies to S = F + 13.

We also know that S + A + F = 85. Substituting the first equation into this equation, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85.

Combine like terms: 2F + A + 13 = 85.

Substituting the second equation into this equation, we get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85.

Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84.

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28.

Next, we know he ate 10 pieces on the second day.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find this out, we multiply 7/13 by 26. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day:

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. To figure out the total cost, we need to know the cost of each item.

Let's start with the soda. If 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, then 1 bottle of soda costs $21.00 / 7 = $3.00. Now, we can find the cost of 3 bottles of soda: 3 x $3.00 = $9.00.

Next, let's look at the water. If 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, then 1 bottle of water costs $8.00 / 4 = $2.00. Now, we can find the cost of 2 bottles of water: 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

Now that we have the cost of the soda and the water, we can add them together to find the total cost: $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of the bolts is the number of bolts multiplied by the cost per bolt:
16 bolts * $0.03 per bolt = $0.48

Now, let's subtract the cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, David has $12.00 left after buying the bolts.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens is:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000, so the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, the amount he needs to make from selling the chickens to make a profit of $2000 is $9000. 

However, we are asked for the cost price of the chickens. To find the cost price, we need to subtract the profit from the selling price. 

The selling price is $9000 and the profit is $2000. 

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, each packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the chicken: 6 packets of chicken * $4 = $24.

Next, we need to find the cost of the apples. Since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, and each pack of strawberries costs $4, each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the apples: 7 packs of apples * $2 = $14.

The total cost of the bacon is $10, the total cost of the chicken is $24, the total cost of the strawberries is $12, and the total cost of the apples is $14. So, the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it includes a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as x minutes. The final concert's runtime is 2x minutes, and adding the 15-minute encore gives us 2x + 15 minutes.

Since the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

To find the number of microphones that will be arranged in pairs, we can calculate 80% of 50. 

80% of 50 = 0.8 * 50 = 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the total number of microphones arranged in pairs by 2.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down the problem. Joelle has 5 orchids and 4 African daisies on her balcony. The orchids have 5 petals each, and the daisies have 10 petals each.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, let's find the total number of petals on the daisies: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, to find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. 

First, we find the number of indoor plants: 100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining plants: 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Next, we find the number of outdoor plants: 75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants: 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"I'd be happy to help you figure out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day.

Let's break down the information given:

- Ellen eats 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
- The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11.

We know that the total cost is the sum of the cost of 2 carrots, the salad, and the yogurt. Let's represent the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Then, the cost of 2 carrots is 2x.

The total cost equation is: 2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down Mark's situation. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. His hourly wage used to be $10, but it got raised by $2. To find out how much he makes in a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

First, we add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage: $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Next, we calculate the total number of hours he works in a week: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x (for Joe's lawn) + 18x (for Kamala's lawn) + 30x (for Alba's lawn) = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

To find y, we need to find the value of x. Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y. 
54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

The final answer is: $26"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to find Christian's weight first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg.
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down John's car rental business. He rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour. His car payment is $500. To find out how much profit he makes, we need to calculate his total earnings from renting the car.

First, we multiply the number of times he rents it by the number of hours and his hourly rate.

Number of times rented: 10
Number of hours per rental: 3
Hourly rate: $25

Total earnings = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, we subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha.
2. Martha bought 5 more notebooks, and now she has a total of 7 notebooks.

From point 2, we can find out how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since she bought 5 more and now has 7, she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha had 2 notebooks initially, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: 1"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Dijana and Anis went out rowing on the lake, and Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find the total distance they rowed, I need to figure out how far Anis rowed.

To find 1/5 of 50 miles, I multiply 50 by 1/5. That's 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, I just need to add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to get the total. That's 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas and was planning to divide them equally among her 6 nephews. However, her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself before she could package them. 

To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to first determine how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took some. There were 100 cookies initially, and he took 4, so there are 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's break down the information given. Denise read 10 pages yesterday, and Daniel read 13 pages yesterday. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, we only need to consider yesterday's reading.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, and Denise read 10 pages yesterday. To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total. 

Denise's total pages read yesterday = 10
Daniel's total pages read yesterday = 13

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 13 - 10 = 3.

However, we also need to consider the additional 5 pages Denise read today. So, we add those to her total.

Denise's total pages read = 10 (yesterday) + 5 (today) = 15
Daniel's total pages read = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 15 - 13 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"I'm Kai, and I'm happy to help you with this problem. 

Let's break it down step by step. Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since he's an adult, and he's eating with his wife and two children, that makes a total of 4 adults and 2 children, which is 6 people in total.

Each person will eat one bowl at dinner, so 6 bowls will be used. Since the pot can fill 8 child bowls, and 4 adult bowls are equal to 4 child bowls, we can say that 4 adult bowls were used, leaving 4 child bowls used and 4 child bowls left.

Now, we need to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup. There are 2 children, and 4 child bowls left. To find out how many times each child can have a bowl, we divide the number of child bowls left by the number of children: 4 / 2 = 2.

So, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, William bought 5 notebooks at $1.50 each and a ballpen at $0.5. To find out how much he spent in total, I'll calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen at $0.5 is $0.5

Now, let's add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together: $7.50 + $0.5 = $8

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Jo's been making face masks, and she's got a few different rates going on. She can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, or 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. We need to figure out how much material she'll need to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class.

Let's start with the small masks. If she uses 2 yards to make 4 small masks, that's 0.5 yards per small mask. So, for 20 small masks, she'll need 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards of material.

Now, let's look at the large masks. If she uses 2.25 yards to make 3 large masks, that's 0.75 yards per large mask. For 8 large masks, she'll need 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards of material.

To find the total amount of material she needs, we just add the material for the small and large masks together: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem. Deepa saw each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies three times, which means she bought a total of 9 * 3 = 27 tickets.

To find the average price she paid per ticket, we need to divide the total amount she spent by the total number of tickets. The total amount she spent is $216.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

"Let's break down Harold's daily activities. He sleeps for 10 hours a night, which is a pretty standard amount. On top of that, he works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours. And, of course, he also spends an hour walking his dog each day.

To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends on these activities. There are 24 hours in a day.

Harold spends 10 hours sleeping, 8 hours working, and 1 hour walking his dog. So, the total hours spent on these activities is 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.

Now, let's calculate the free time: 24 (total hours in a day) - 19 (total hours spent) = 5 hours.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down the problem. Tim has 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. He decides to use 3 blue shoeboxes and 1/3 of his red shoeboxes to go fishing.

To find out how many red shoeboxes he used, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9. 

1/3 of 9 = 9 / 3 = 3

So, Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes to go fishing.

Now, let's find out how many shoeboxes are left. Initially, Tim had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. After using 3 blue and 3 red shoeboxes, he is left with:

Blue shoeboxes: 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoeboxes: 9 - 3 = 6

Therefore, the total number of shoeboxes left is 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10.

"To find out how many books Joseph has, we first need to determine how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, we multiply 9 by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

So, Joseph initially had 18 books. However, he lost 2 of them. To find out how many books he currently has, we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books.

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, let's figure out how many marbles Dean has left. 

Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives 1/5 of them to Jamie. To find out how many marbles that is, we need to divide 30 by 5. 30 / 5 = 6. 

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. Then, he gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to subtract the marbles he gave away from the marbles he started with. 30 - 16 = 14.

So, (60 - 8) = 2x
52 = 2x
x = 26

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam's age four years ago was 26, his current age is 26 + 4 = 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. To find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm is, we need to calculate twice the acres of Farmer Brown's farm and add 100 to it. 

Twice the acres of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we need to add the acres of both farms together. 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

"Let's break down the problem. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. We know he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna and that 20 of the balloons were red.

First, let's find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons. Since there are 20 red balloons, and Benny threw 2 pieces at each, the total is 20 * 2 = 40 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. Since the total is 58 and 40 were thrown at the red balloons, 58 - 40 = 18 pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total pieces thrown at yellow balloons by 3. 18 / 3 = 6.

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 6"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream. The cake costs $11, and 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out how many pets Larry has. Let's break it down step by step.

Larry has 3 cats. That's a good start.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Now, let's talk about the rabbits. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Moving on to the fish tank, Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits, which means he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Lastly, he has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

Let's break it down: Martha collects shells for 5 years, and there are 12 months in a year. To find the total number of months, we multiply 5 years by 12 months/year.

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with the problem.

Lana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has 27 cups, and she divides these into 3 rows. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. She then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can calculate the number of cups in each row by dividing 27 by 3.

27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 / 2. However, since you can't have half a cup of tea, we need to consider the possible options.

If there are 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. But we know that the total number of mint tea cups is 15, so this option is not correct.

If there are 5 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15. This matches the given information, so this option is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The number of cups of mint tea in each row is 5."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip, which means he can make 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We start with 10000 gallons of water in a pool. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Now, they use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day. We need to find out how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days.

To do this, we need to find the total amount of water used from the tank in 6 days. Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, the total amount of water used in 6 days is 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"Let's break down Colby's expenses for the month. He's already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby's monthly budget is $150, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can spend $10 of his remaining money on a ticket. This leaves him with $20 - $10 = $10.

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

Colby has already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays and 8 movies on other days. He wants to see a movie on a Friday, so he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. He can also see 1 more movie on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two types of pastries: mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins. 

First, we need to find the calories of each type of mini pastry. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, we need to find the calories of the mini blueberry muffins. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories. 

Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Now, we add the total calories from both types of pastries to find the overall total. The total calories from both types of pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 378 / 5 = 75.6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a bus and a car, and we need to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car.

First, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled. The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so we multiply its speed by the time: 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

Next, we do the same for the car, which travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours: 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls.

Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls = Number of blocks + Number of stuffed animals + Number of rings
= 31 + 8 + 9
= 48

Total number of toys after buying bouncy balls = 62

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after buying bouncy balls - Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J.

From the given information, we can form the following equations:

1. P + Pp + J = 100
2. Pp = J + 10
3. P = Pp + J

We can substitute Pp from equation 2 into equation 1:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P from equation 3 into the above equation:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Maria invited 4 of her friends over for a water balloon fight. At the start of the game, she gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. She had one water balloon for herself. Then her mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. Let's count the total number of balloons they have.

First, we need to find out how many balloons Maria's friends have. Since there are 4 friends and each of them has 2 balloons, that's 4 * 2 = 8 balloons. Maria also has 1 balloon, so the total number of balloons initially is 8 + 1 = 9.

Now, Maria's mom gives each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

To find the total number of balloons, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Hey, let's figure out how many tables the charity group needs for their yard sale. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. They get 10 people donating 5 boxes each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Now, we need to find out how many tables they need. Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we divide the total number of boxes by 2. That's 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

The charity group already owns 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"Hey, let's calculate the average total distance spat in the watermelon seed spitting contest between Zoey and Sydney.

Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, her total distance is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, her total distance is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Now, let's add their total distances together: 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

To find the average, we need to divide the total distance by the total number of seeds spat. The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

Average total distance spat = Total distance spat / Total seeds spat = 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet

The final answer is: 10.93"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

First, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour, and it runs 24 hours a day for 30 days. So, the total number of widgets it can produce is:

60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour, and it also runs 24 hours a day for 30 days. So, the total number of widgets it can produce is:

45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue of the Widgeteer 3000:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"Let's break down Cameron's hotel stay. He arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay, and 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. However, Cameron can also choose to pay 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark.

Since Cameron stays for 17 hours, he needs to pay for the initial 12 hours and the additional 5 hours. The cost of the additional hours is 70 * 5 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the 24-hour option, which is 1600 pesos. To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

So, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the 12-hour option with additional hours instead of the 24-hour option.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs.

Twice the amount each goat needs is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"Let's break down John's situation. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked for 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars. After spending 50 dollars on gas, he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

John also wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, which means he'll have 250 - 100 = 150 dollars remaining.

Now, let's consider the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars, and John wants to buy 5 of them. The total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. After buying the pencils, John will have 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

With the remaining 100 dollars, John can buy 25-dollar pens. To find out how many pens he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of each pen: 100 / 25 = 4.

So, John can buy 4 pens with the money he has left."
"Let's break down the problem. Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. To find the total number of letters in the words he spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters Craig spelled to the total number of letters his brother spelled: 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: 650"

They're standing 8 in a row, and there are 7 rows for each of the 5 different schools. To find out how many kids are participating, we need to multiply the number of kids in each row by the number of rows and then by the number of schools.

Number of kids in each row: 8
Number of rows: 7
Number of schools: 5

Total number of kids = 8 * 7 * 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gets. She has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she gets is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, to find out how many bottles she has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she got. 

900 - 58 = 842

The final answer is: 842"
"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the visit fee.

First, let's calculate the labor cost. Since Patty charges $35 per hour, or part thereof, for labor, we multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly rate. In this case, the job took 2.25 hours, so the labor cost is 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75.

Next, we add the cost of parts, which is $60, and the visit fee, which is $40.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much James spent on the CDs. Since each CD costs $15 and he bought 10 of them, the original price is 10 * $15 = $150.

However, James got a 40% discount on the CDs. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 0.4: 0.4 * $150 = $60. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the price after the discount: $150 - $60 = $90.

Next, James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, making a total of 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the price after the discount from the amount he made from selling the CDs: $200 - $90 = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"Let's break down the earnings from Jen's root crops. She has 6 yams that can be sold at $1.5 each, so the total earnings from yams are 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, she has 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each, so the total earnings from sweet potatoes are 10 * $2 = $20.

Lastly, she has 4 carrots that cost $1.25 each, so the total earnings from carrots are 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"Let's break down James' journey across the lake. First, we need to find the time it took him to swim 60% of the 20-mile lake. To do that, we need to calculate 60% of 20 miles.

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, let's figure out how many loaves of bread the bakery has. We know Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had.

To find the number of loaves the bakery has, we need to multiply the number of loaves Sam had by 7. That's 7 * 70 = 490.

Now, we need to subtract 40 from that result. So, 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much commission Cayley will earn from selling newspapers.

First, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times. The number of copies sold is 6, the price per copy is $5, and the commission rate is 10%. To find the commission, we multiply the number of copies sold by the price per copy and then multiply by the commission rate, and finally divide by 100.

Commission from New York Times = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
Commission from New York Times = 300 / 100
Commission from New York Times = $3

Next, we need to calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal. The number of copies sold is 10, the price per copy is $15, and the commission rate is 8%. To find the commission, we multiply the number of copies sold by the price per copy and then multiply by the commission rate, and finally divide by 100.

Commission from Wall Street Journal = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
Commission from Wall Street Journal = 1200 / 100
Commission from Wall Street Journal = $12

Now, we add the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal to find the total commission.

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's figure out Leo's age. We know Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can find his age by subtracting 5 from Deanna's age: 26 - 5 = 21.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. 

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We can start by setting up the equations based on the given information. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, we can write B = A + 20. 

Also, since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, we can write B = D + 10. 

We know that the total points scored by the three of them is 45, so we can write the equation B + A + D = 45. 

Now, we can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (A + 20) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45. 

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45. 

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0. 

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10. 

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation 2A + D + 20 = 45 to get 2(D - 10) + D + 20 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D - 20 + 20 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = 15 - 10. 

This simplifies to A = 5. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, we have 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers to the inch, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

The book is 1.5 inches thick, so the total number of pages in the book is 200 * 1.5 = 300 pages.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked:
11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:
15 * 60 = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 / 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 * 60 = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can find the number of spoons by multiplying the number of cups by 2/3. 

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 spoons.

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of cups and the number of spoons.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

"To find the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to determine the initial number of occupied beds. Since 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we calculate 1/5 of 1000.

1/5 of 1000 = 200

This means 200 beds are occupied initially. Since 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied, we calculate 4/5 of 1000.

4/5 of 1000 = 800

Next, we need to find the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we multiply 50 by 14 (the number of days in 2 weeks).

50 * 14 = 700

Now, we add the number of occupied beds initially to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

200 + 700 = 900

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

1000 - 900 = 100

"Let's break down Robyn's emails. She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work-related. To find out how many non-work emails she sends, we subtract the work emails from the total: 16 - 7 = 9.

Now, we know that two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family. To find out how many emails are to her family, we multiply 9 by 2/3: 9 * (2/3) = 6.

The remaining non-work emails (not to family) are 9 - 6 = 3. Now, we need to find out how many of these emails are to her boyfriend. Since one-third of these emails are to her boyfriend, we multiply 3 by 1/3: 3 * (1/3) = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, we need to find the total number of balls carried by the three boys. We can do this by adding the number of balls each of them carried: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day. On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

"Let's break down the problem. Amora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally, but it turned out that only two people would get an equal amount, while the other person would receive 15 more corn chips than the number the others got. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each.

Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add the number of corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = 70 + 70 + 85
Total = 225

"Hey, let's break down the problem. Jen needs to pay $400 for supplies. The cost of travel is 50% more than the supplies. To find 50% of the supplies, we multiply $400 by 0.5: 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Now, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three friends, Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe, who are trying to catch Pokémon. Together, they have caught 339 Pokémon.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. We know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so we can write an equation: L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less Pokémon than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write another equation: S = 4A - 13.

Now, let's use the fact that together they have caught 339 Pokémon to write an equation: A + S + L = 339.

We can substitute the first equation into the third one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
This simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.
Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, John just started watching a new show, and each episode is 20 minutes long. The show has half as many episodes as there are minutes in each episode. To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to figure out how many episodes there are.

Since there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, and each episode is 20 minutes long, we divide 20 by 2 to get the number of episodes. 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

Now, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode to get the total time John will spend watching the show: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's break down the bird's journey to find the distance between her northern and southern homes.

First, the bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. To find the distance traveled in this direction, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Next, the bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this direction is: 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Finally, the bird flies south again for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this direction is: 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, we need to find the net distance between the two homes. Since the bird traveled 36 miles north, we subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction: 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"Hey there, let's break down Greta's brownie situation. She started with a dozen brownies she made for herself, which is 12 brownies. Then, she got 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. And, her friends surprised her with 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

So, let's add up all the brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Now, we need to subtract the brownies that got eaten during the party. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were devoured, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

To find out how many brownies Greta has left, we subtract the eaten brownies from the total: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

To find Nani's sister's age, we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age. Since 25% is the same as 0.25, we multiply Nani's age by 0.25 to find the age difference. Then, we subtract this age difference from Nani's age to find his sister's age.

25% of 8 is 8 * 0.25 = 2 years. So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes

Next, we'll calculate the time for polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes

Then, we'll calculate the time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we add the times together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

The final answer is: 227"
"Let's break down the cost of the phones. The first two phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining two phones are half price, so each costs $600 / 2 = $300. The total cost for the remaining two phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

To find the total cost for all four phones, we add the cost of the first two phones to the cost of the remaining two phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Zeke's baseball team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. If Carlton's team has 13 players, we can find the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13. 

13 + 7 = 20

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Robert is building a rectangular wooden fence for his garden. The fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. To find out how many wooden slats he'll need, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Plugging in the values, we get: Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she has 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left. The total number of oranges in these 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's figure out the total number of states in the USA and India together.

The USA has 50 states. 

To find the number of states in India, we need to calculate half of 50, which is 25, and then add 4 to it. 25 + 4 = 29. 

So, India has 29 states. 

Now, let's add the number of states in both countries together: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Tyler wants to buy a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a children's cookbook that costs $8. He has saved $14 from his allowance. If Tyler earns $5 per hour, how many hours does he have to work to afford his books?

To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can find the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. To find out how many cherries Richard has, we subtract 10 from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Richard and Robert have 20 + 30 = 50 cherries together, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's total from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which means he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Since he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday, and he sold 15 boxes on Sunday, he must have sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Pamela's going on a vacation and she's planning to reapply sunscreen every hour. She's outside for 4 hours a day, and she's going to be there for 8 days. 

To figure out how many bottles of sunscreen she'll need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she'll use. Since she reapplies sunscreen 4 times a day, and she's outside for 8 days, she'll reapply sunscreen 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce. So, she'll use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total. 

Now, let's see how many bottles she'll need. Each bottle is 8 ounces, so we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she'll use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, you want to know the prices of a red car and a blue car. The blue car costs $100, and the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.

To find the price of the red car, I'll calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car. 

40% of $100 is 0.4 * $100 = $40.

Now, I'll subtract the discount from the price of the blue car: $100 - $40 = $60.

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The total cost of both cars is the sum of their prices: $100 + $60 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil will be 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

From point 2, we know that when Emil turns 24, his dad will be twice as old as Emil. So, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Now, we need to find the current age of Emil's dad and brother. Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old (since Emil is 19 now and will turn 24 in 5 years). Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

"Hey, let's break down the problem. We have a class of 30 students. First, we need to find out how many of them are football players. To do that, we calculate 20% of 30.

20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students.

Now, we subtract the football players from the total number of students to find the remaining students.
30 - 6 = 24 students.

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band. To do that, we calculate 25% of the remaining 24 students.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early.
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the width of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract 18 inches from the total length of the flower bed for each plant. However, we also need to subtract the width of the plant itself (12 inches) from the remaining length. 

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 18n - 12n = 1320 - 30n.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 * 7 = 63

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

"I'd be happy to help Katherine figure out how much she'll spend on her hanging baskets.

To do this, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the petunias. Katherine has 5 baskets and wants to put 3 petunias in each one. So, she'll need 5 * 3 = 15 petunias. Each petunia costs $3.00, so the total cost of the petunias will be 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

Next, let's find the cost of the sweet potato vines. Katherine has 5 baskets and wants to put 2 vines in each one. So, she'll need 5 * 2 = 10 sweet potato vines. Each vine costs $2.50, so the total cost of the sweet potato vines will be 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

Now, we can add the cost of the petunias and sweet potato vines together to find the total cost. $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"I'm Kai, and I'm happy to help you with this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations. We know that each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they're planting 4 sunflowers. So, the total soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, we need to calculate the soil used for the carnations. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they're planting 10 carnations. So, the total soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations together. 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

They have a 30-pound bag of soil, so we need to subtract the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total. 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

"Hey there, let's break down Jessica's situation. She makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. To find out how much she saves each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she saves $500.00 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year to find the total savings in a year: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we need to divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we need to divide 90 by 6. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Now, let's look at the cooking time. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp, we need to divide 90 by 30.

90 / 30 = 3, so it will take her 3 times 10 minutes to cook 90 shrimp, which is 30 minutes.

Since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Next, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the second time, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet and then use that information to determine Bill's age at the time of the second sighting.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 

Three times the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is 3 * 30 = 90 years old. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. 

So, Bill's dad was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when Bill was born. 

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, Bill was 30 - 15 = 15 years old when his dad was born.

Now, let's find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. We know that the time between Bill's dad seeing the comet and Bill seeing it for the second time is 75 years. 

Since Bill was 15 years old when his dad was born, and his dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 15 + 30 = 45 years old when his dad saw the comet. 

The time between Bill's dad seeing the comet and Bill seeing it for the first time is 45 - 30 = 15 years. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between Bill's dad seeing the comet and Bill seeing it for the first time is 75 years. 

So, the time between Bill seeing the comet for the first time and Bill seeing it for the second time is 75 - 15 = 60 years.

Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, Bill was 90 - 60 = 30 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

He also writes a check every month for his gas bill, which is another 12 times a year. Additionally, he writes two checks to the church every month, so that's 24 checks per year. Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service every quarter, which is 4 times a year.

To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to add these numbers together: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

"Let's break down the information given. We know that the first plane makes a total of x flights per day. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the total number of flights made by the first plane by doubling the number of flights made by the second plane. So, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights per day.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. To find the number of flights to Greece, we multiply the total number of flights made by the first plane by three-quarters. This gives us (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights to Greece.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we subtract the number of flights to Greece from the total number of flights made by the first plane and then divide the result by 2. This gives us (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11 flights to France.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Adam's mom gave him $6, and his dad gave him 2 * $6 = $12. So, in total, Adam got $6 + $12 = $18 from his parents.

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to subtract the amount he got from his parents from the cost of the trousers. That's $30 - $18 = $12.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have four children: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old.

First, let's find the total age of Akbar and Alessandro: 3 + 4 = 7. Since the total age of the children is 20, we can find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred by subtracting the age of Akbar and Alessandro from the total age: 20 - 7 = 13.

Now, let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10. We already know that the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, so we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting Helene's age from the combined age: 13 - 10 = 3.

The total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

However, Walter's lawyer will only consider the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, not the $200 donated by his friend. So, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 is still $2000.

To find out how much the lawyer will contribute, we multiply $2000 by 3.

$2000 * 3 = $6000

First, let's find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a family of 6, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids. They want to divide a watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

Let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. If each kid gets x units, then each adult gets 2x units, since they get twice as much as each kid.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each). The total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combine like terms: 6x = 100.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

The final answer is: 33.33"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes
Convert total time from minutes to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Jordan wants to surprise her mom with a homemade birthday cake. She's got a plan to make it all on the same day, and she wants to serve it at 5:00 pm. Let's break down the time it'll take to make the cake.

First, she needs to make the cake batter, which takes 20 minutes. Then, she's got to bake the cake, which takes 30 minutes. After that, the cake needs to cool for 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. Finally, she needs to frost the cake, which takes an additional 10 minutes.

Now, let's add up all those times: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

So, Jordan needs 3 hours to make the cake. To be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm, she should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem. Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars door to door. Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, and Peter sold four and a half boxes. They sold 64 chocolate bars together.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total earnings per month are $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem. We know Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each. We also know that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars.

To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the number of female porcupines in the park. Since the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Now, let's determine the total number of babies born in a year. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, and there are 12 months in a year. So, the total number of babies born in a year is:

Total babies born in a year = 4 * 12 = 48

To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we add the initial population to the number of babies born:

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, the Smith family needs to know how much it'll cost to fill their pool. To find out, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. 

To find the volume, we multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, my friends and I were playing pick-up sticks, and we counted the sticks. We have 9 red sticks. There are 5 more blue sticks than red, which means we have 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks. 

Now, let's figure out how many yellow sticks we have. We know there are 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue sticks, so we have 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how many miles each person traveled, and then compare their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.

First, we'll calculate Matteo's distance by multiplying his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

Next, we'll calculate Shandy's distance by multiplying his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that there are 3000 students in total. Half of these students are over 16 years old, which means there are 1500 students over 16. 

Now, let's find out how many of these students are male. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 are male, we can calculate this by dividing 1500 by 4, which equals 375.

To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Next, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which also equals 1500 students.

Now, let's find out how many of these students are male. Since one-half of the students under 16 are male, we can calculate this by dividing 1500 by 2, which equals 750.

To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Finally, to find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"Let's break down the information given about the people running laps on the track.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps. 

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, which means she can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Maria's power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours, and then it loses 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. We're also given that the final charge remaining is 28%.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

For the next 3 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%. However, we know that the final charge remaining is 28%, so the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

Since the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 6%, we can set up the equation: 34% - 28% = 6%. This equation is true, so we can move on to the next step.

Now, we need to find the initial charge, x. We know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%, and the charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 34% = 21%. So, we can set up the equation: x - 21% = 55%.

Solving for x, we get x = 76%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 76%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{76}$"
"Hey there, let's break down Janet's situation. She's a waitress making $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, which means her total hourly earnings are $25. 

If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings would be $25 * 40 = $1000.

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for the down payment. To find 20% of $10,000, we multiply $10,000 by 0.2, which equals $2000.

Now, to determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruits. He's already bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, 4 pears at $0.5 each, 2 kiwis at $1 each, and 5 apples at $0.75 each.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Now, let's find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining money. Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down the problem. Anne bought a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. She kept 2 packs for herself and gave the rest to her 10 friends equally.

First, we need to find out how many packs she gave away. Since she kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, we need to divide the packs she gave away (13) by the number of friends (10) to find out how many packs each friend received. 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are in 0.3 packs. To do this, we multiply 0.3 by 60. 0.3 * 60 = 18.

So, each friend received 1 pack (60 pieces) and 0.3 packs (18 pieces). To find the total number of pieces each friend received, we add 60 and 18. 60 + 18 = 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"I'd be happy to help you calculate the price of carrots after three years.

To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. 

To find the number of pictures in each album, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Since 3 albums were selfies only, the number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums = 5 albums. 
The number of portraits is 5 albums * 9 pictures per album = 45 portraits.

However, we were also told that 2 of the albums were portraits. This means that the 5 albums of portraits include the 2 portrait albums, and the remaining 3 albums are also portraits. So, the number of portraits is actually 2 albums * 9 pictures per album + 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits + 27 portraits = 45 portraits.

The total number of portraits and selfies is 27 selfies + 45 portraits = 72."
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, James is reading a book and it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages. He decides to stop after reading 18 pages. To figure out how long he spent reading, we need to find out how many sets of 3 pages he read.

We can do this by dividing the total number of pages he read (18) by the number of pages per set (3). That's 18 / 3 = 6 sets.

Now, we know it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages. So, we multiply the number of sets by the time per set: 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are in the quiz. We know that there are 60 questions in total, and 40% of them are easy. To find 40% of 60, we multiply 0.4 by 60.

0.4 * 60 = 24

So, there are 24 easy questions. The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, which means there are 36 questions left. We can divide 36 by 2 to find the number of average and difficult questions.

36 / 2 = 18

There are 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find out how many of each type of question Aries is sure to get. We know that Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions. To find 75% of 24, we multiply 0.75 by 24.

0.75 * 24 = 18

Aries is sure to get 18 easy questions. We also know that Aries is sure to get 50% of the average and difficult questions. To find 50% of 18, we multiply 0.5 by 18.

0.5 * 18 = 9

Aries is sure to get 9 average questions and 9 difficult questions.

Now, let's add up the number of questions Aries is sure to get.

18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Since x = 2y, we can substitute this into the equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem. We have a family with a man, his wife, and their son. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The total number of sandwiches they eat per day is 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches.

In one week, they eat 11 * 7 = 77 sandwiches.

Adding these two amounts together, we get $80 + $240 = $320. 

However, Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of 2 * $10 = $20. 

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. He can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

Now, let's calculate how much more ore he can mine with a steel pickaxe compared to an iron pickaxe. 50% more than 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Next, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month, which has 30 days. We multiply 1440 by 30 to get the total amount of ore mined in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2 and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2. 

Since the ratios are the same, the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches will be proportional to the price of the second package. 

The price of the second package is $6 for 4 sandwiches. To find the price per sandwich, we divide the price by the number of sandwiches: 6/4 = 1.5. 

Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: 1.5 * 8 = 12.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step. Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the bedroom set. This means he still owes $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how much Tom has to pay per month. The interest rate is 10% per month, which is the same as 0.10. To find the monthly payment, we multiply the amount still owed by the interest rate:

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sally initially had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. To find the number of red balloons that burst, we multiply 25 by 0.4: 25 * 0.4 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons Sally has: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. That's a total of 34 balloons.

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

The probability of not having to turn in his homework is 102% - 100% = 2%. However, this is not possible since the probability cannot be greater than 100%. To find the correct probability, we need to subtract the probability of the three scenarios from 100%: 100% - 50% - 40% - 12% = -2%. However, this is not possible since the probability cannot be negative.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Apple High School is having their graduation at the Fine Arts Center, which can hold 6000 people. They've reserved 950 seats for the graduates and 300 seats for the faculty. To figure out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 1250
Available seats = 4750

Now, let's divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

So, each graduate can give 5 tickets to their friends and family."
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat.

Let's start by looking at the information we have. It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, that means he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we can set up a proportion. Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Then, 3x = 150.

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

The final answer is: 50"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Melissa is summoned to jury duty and spends 6 hours a day for 3 days listening to a court case. She's paid $15 per day, but she also has to pay $3 for parking each day. Let's break it down.

First, we need to find out how much she earns in total. Since she's paid $15 per day for 3 days, her total earnings are 3 * $15 = $45.

Now, let's calculate her total expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * $3 = $9.

To find out how much she makes after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings: $45 - $9 = $36.

Next, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total. Since she works 6 hours a day for 3 days, her total hours are 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses: $36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Hey there, let's break down Ted's expenses. He starts with $200. He buys 3 books for $16 each and 3 pencils for $6 each. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the books: 3 * 16 = 48 dollars
Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils: 3 * 6 = 18 dollars

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars

So, Ted spent a total of $66."
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Richard wants to set up a pretty cool science experiment in his driveway. He's got a 24-foot-wide driveway and he wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find out how many bottles he can fit, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Now, it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. To find the total time it will take him to set off all the soda fountains, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

The final answer is: 40"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Uncle Franky ordered two boxes of apples, and each box has 40 apples. To find out how many apples he has in total, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box: 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Now, he wants to pack the apples with 8 apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 80 / 8 = 10.

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound and 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the Parmesan cheese: 2 pounds * $11 per pound = $22.
Next, we calculate the total cost of the mozzarella cheese: 3 pounds * $6 per pound = $18.
Now, we add the costs of both types of cheese to get the total cost: $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount: $50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"Let's break down Jim's situation. He took 4 years to finish college, during which he got $50,000 in loans per year. This adds up to a total of 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000 in loans.

Additionally, he lost $25,000 per year for 4 years due to not working while in college, which is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

So, the total amount of money Jim needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, making it $75,000 per year. To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

To find the dimensions of the fabric pieces, we add 2 feet to the length and width of the bed. So, the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

Now, let's calculate the area of one piece of fabric. The area is length * width, so the area of one piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Johnny's dad went to watch some horse racing and placed some bets. He lost $5 in the first race. Then, in the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. That's 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, that's 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

There were 3 races in total. To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

"To find the total population of South America, we need to calculate the total number of people living in all the cities. 

There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities. So, the total number of cities is 26 * 5 = 130.

Since each city has 1000 people, we multiply the total number of cities by the population of each city: 130 * 1000 = 130,000.

The final answer is: 130000"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, let's figure out the difference in height between Cole and Xavier. Xavier was initially 4 feet tall, which is equivalent to 48 inches. He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole, on the other hand, was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer, making his new height 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, let's find the difference in their heights: 52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three people who divided an amount of $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first, and the third person took twice what the second took.

Let's denote the share of the first person as x. The second person's share would then be x + 80, and the third person's share would be 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combining like terms, we get: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Simplifying further, we get: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtracting 240 from both sides, we get: 4x = 1680.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 420.

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car is $20,000, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * depreciation rate)
= $12,472 - ($12,472 * 0.21)
= $12,472 - $2,620.32
= $9,851.68

The final answer is: $9851.68"
"To find the number of Spanish books in the library, we need to determine how many books are written in English and German first. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, which is 50 / 2 = 25 books.
10% of the books are written in German, which is 50 * 0.1 = 5 books.

Now, we add the number of English and German books together: 25 + 5 = 30 books.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 325 kilometers

Distance left to drive = Total distance - Distance driven

= 1630 kilometers

The final answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. 
There are 16 cups in a gallon. 
So, 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Romeo boards a train with 120 people. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"Let's break down the costs of the athletic gear Alison bought.

The tank top costs $10. 
The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

The final answer is: $55"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, you want to know how much it'll cost to renovate your kitchen floor, right? 

First, let's figure out how many tiles you'll need. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, it covers 1 SqFt. Your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, so you'll need 200 tiles.

Now, let's talk about the cost. Each tile costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, James had an accident and now his insurance costs are 60% more than the normal rate. The normal cost is $120 a month. To find the increased cost, I'll calculate 60% of $120.

60% of $120 is 0.6 * $120 = $72. Now, I'll add this to the normal cost to get the increased cost.

Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, I'll multiply it by 12.

Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many sheets Greg puts on the beds every week. He has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"Hey, let's break down the problem. Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, we need to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks. To do this, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4.

6 * 4 = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's talk about Leo's sticker collection. Two years ago, he had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had a total of 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. So, this year he has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 250 = 500 stickers.

The final answer is: 500"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each time. To figure out how many days the 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate how much each cat eats in a day and then divide the total amount of cat food by that.

Each cat eats 60 grams of cat food twice a day, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 grams per cat per day.

Now, let's multiply the amount each cat eats per day by the number of cats: 120 grams * 3 cats = 360 grams per day.

To find out how many days the cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount each cat eats per day (360 grams): 720 / 360 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas in total. So, the total number of slices is 8 * 4 = 32.

We're also given that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, which means Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes.

Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: 58"
"Let's break down the costs of Hannah's doctor's visit.

First, there's the cost of the cast, which is $200. 

Next, we have the cost of the doctor's visit. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit lasted for 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Then, there are the painkillers. Hannah needs 30 painkillers at $4 each, so the total cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Finally, there's the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"Let's break down James' email situation. He gets 80 emails a day, but 20% of those don't require a response. To find out how many emails he doesn't respond to, we need to calculate 20% of 80.

20% of 80 is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

Now, let's calculate how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

In a 5-day work week, James responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we need to calculate 70% of 20. 

70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and there are 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of coupon. The cost per small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents. The cost per big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. To find out how many he ordered, we need to subtract 3 from 10. 

10 - 3 = 7

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

7 * 4 = 28

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, there were 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left. Sidney ordered 3 more sub sandwiches. 

3 + 3 = 6

Now, there are 6 meatball sub sandwiches left. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

6 * 4 = 24

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

First, we need to find the number of trucks that had mechanical failures. A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, so we calculate this by multiplying the total number of trucks by 1/4.

Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4)
= 20 * 0.25
= 5

Now, we need to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers. This is the total number of trucks minus the number of trucks with mechanical failures.

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5
= 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons per truck.

Total tons of fertiliser = 15 * 20
= 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

Since Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he needs 6 pounds of butter. 

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, so for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays the full price of $4.00 for one pound and half off for the other pound. 

For 6 pounds of butter, he will need to buy 3 sets of 2 pounds. 

The cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter is:
- 3 sets * $4.00 (full price) = $12.00
- 3 sets * $2.00 (half off) = $6.00
- Total cost for 6 pounds of butter = $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Kayla's having her birthday party at a movie theater, and I'm helping her figure out the costs. The initial fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest.

First, let's calculate the total number of guests. Kayla invited her 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. That's a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests. However, 4 people said they couldn't make it, so we subtract those from the total: 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find out how many additional guests there are. That's 41 - 20 = 21 guests.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the additional guests. It's $6 per guest, so 21 * 6 = $126. Adding the initial fee of $125, the total cost is $126 + $125 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending some money, we can assume they both had the same amount initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. To find the initial amount of money Maggie had, we can set up an equation: 3/4 * x = 60, where x is the initial amount of money Maggie had. Solving for x, we get x = 60 / (3/4) = 80.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. To find the initial amount of money Riza had, we can set up an equation: 2/3 * x = 60, where x is the initial amount of money Riza had. Solving for x, we get x = 60 / (2/3) = 90.

However, this is not possible since they both had the same amount initially. Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Maggie had $60 after spending a quarter of her money, then she had 4/3 * 60 = 80 dollars initially. If Riza had $60 after spending one-third of her money, then she had 3/2 * 60 = 90 dollars initially.

Now, let's find the total amount of money they had initially: 80 + 90 = 170.

Since they spent a quarter and one-third of their money respectively, the total amount of money they spent is 1/4 * 170 + 1/3 * 170 = 42.5 + 56.67 = 99.17.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the initial amount: 170 - 99.17 = 70.83.

The final answer is: $70.83"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for his three monkeys, which will last them for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many bananas they eat each day by dividing 315 by 7.

315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, let's figure out how many bananas each monkey eats. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten each day. 

45 (total bananas per day) - 10 (first monkey) - 14 (second monkey) = 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"Hey, let's break down Jenny's flower purchase. She bought 15 roses, and roses cost $2 each or $15 for a dozen. Since 15 roses is 1 dozen and 3 individual roses, she bought 1 dozen roses for $15 and 3 individual roses for 3 * $2 = $6. 

The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21. Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

"I'm Kai, and I'm happy to help you figure out how long Paul will wait for his train.

Let's break down the information we have:

1. The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes and will stay in the station for 20 minutes. So, it will leave the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Melanie's been saving toothpicks for her sculpture, and she's got a plan. She's been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To figure out how many more weeks it'll take her to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to calculate how many she's saved so far.

She saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so the total number of toothpicks she saved is 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, and she already has 120, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs: 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week: 80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

So, it'll take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of the original price, we multiply the original price by 0.75:
2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Next, we need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. He sold it at 120% of the price he bought it, so we multiply the price he bought it for by 1.2:
1500 * 1.2 = $1800

Now, we need to find the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. This is the difference between the original price and the price he paid:
2000 - 1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
(200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with 5 springs, each creating a new jellyfish every second. We need to find out how many jellyfish they'll create in 4 hours.

First, we need to convert 4 hours into seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Now, we know there are 5 springs, and each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second. So, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

To find the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many bananas Jenny bought in total. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, we multiply the number of bunches by the number of bananas per bunch: 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 bananas individually. The price per banana is $0.80, so we multiply the total number of bananas by the price per banana: 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, we need to find the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, we multiply the number of bunches by the price per bunch: 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence between them. They agree to split it, with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam. 

Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, you want to know how much a crocodile will grow in 13 years if it grows 8 inches in 4 years. 

To figure this out, we need to find out how much the crocodile grows per year. We can do this by dividing the total growth by the number of years it took to achieve that growth.

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month.

First, we need to find the number of each type of bike sold. We know that Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, which is 300 / 2 = 150. 

Next, we need to find the number of BMX bikes sold. We know that 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so we multiply 300 by 0.15 to get 45.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105.

Now that we know the number of each type of bike sold, we can calculate the total earnings for each type of bike. The price of a Trekking bike is $450, so 150 * $450 = $67,500. The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500 / 2 = $250. So, 45 * $250 = $11,250. The price of an MTB is $500, so 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The farmer is making 5 bales of hay per hour, and the truck is picking up 3 bales per hour. They both work for 6 hours.

First, we need to find out how many bales the farmer makes in 6 hours. To do this, we multiply the number of bales made per hour by the number of hours worked: 5 * 6 = 30.

Next, we need to find out how many bales the truck picks up in 6 hours. We do this by multiplying the number of bales picked up per hour by the number of hours worked: 3 * 6 = 18.

Now, we need to find out how many bales are left in the field. To do this, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and the extra time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total minutes John spends in class. He has 6 periods a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, we multiply the minutes per period by the number of periods and the number of days: 
6 periods * 40 minutes per period = 240 minutes per day
240 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1200 minutes per week

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends in his extra classes. He has 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, and he attends these classes 5 days a week: 
2 classes * 40 minutes per class = 80 minutes per day
80 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 400 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes: 
1200 minutes per week + 400 minutes per week = 1600 minutes per week

John also spends extra time learning on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his total weekly minutes on these days. To find his total weekly minutes, we multiply the minutes per hour by the hours in a week: 
7 days * 24 hours per day = 168 hours per week
168 hours per week * 60 minutes per hour = 10080 minutes per week
1/16 * 10080 minutes per week = 630 minutes per week
Since he spends this extra time on 2 days, we multiply by 2: 
630 minutes per week * 2 = 1260 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes, and the extra minutes for Saturday and Sunday: 
1600 minutes per week + 1260 minutes per week = 2860 minutes per week

Finally, let's convert the total minutes to hours: 
2860 minutes per week / 60 minutes per hour = 47.67 hours per week

The final answer is: 47.67"
"I'd be happy to help you figure out how high Nathan's bouncy ball goes on its second bounce.

To do this, we need to start with the initial height of the ball. Since Nathan drops it from the third-floor balcony in the mall, and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

Now, we know that the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, after the first bounce, the height of the ball will be 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

Finally, we need to find the height of the ball after the second bounce. This will be 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the heights of Caroline's children step by step.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's get to the problem at hand. An apple orchard sells apples in bags of 10, and they sold a total of 2000 apples one day. To figure out how much they earned, we need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. This 270 kilograms was half of what the velociraptors had. 

To find out how much the velociraptors had, we multiply 270 by 2. That gives us 540 kilograms. 

Now, we know that the velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate. To find out how much the T-Rex ate, we multiply 540 by 2. That gives us 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops must be double what the T-Rex ate. So, we multiply 1080 by 2 to get the original weight of the triceratops.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's break down the situation. Ellen initially had 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas. Then, her brother came along and took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 14.29%."
"Let's break down the problem. We have two trains traveling in opposite directions. One train is going at 60 miles per hour, and the other is going at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the distance each train has traveled after 3 hours, we multiply their speeds by the time. The first train has traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles. The second train has traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they're moving in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them. So, 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find the total number of days Billy helps between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, multiply the number of days Billy helps by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he helps: 
40 * 6 = 240

The final answer is: 240"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Mary and John just got married last weekend, and I'm trying to figure out how many people were inside the church. There were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church. After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people.

Let's start by calculating the total number of people that were transported by the buses. We have 12 buses, and each one carried 35 people, so that's 12 * 35 = 420 people.

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars. We have 20 cars, and each one carried 3 people, so that's 20 * 3 = 60 people.

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars. 420 people + 60 people = 480 people.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, I'm going to assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported, which is 480 people.

The final answer is: 480"
"Let's break down the information given. We know Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than him. To find Martha's age, we subtract 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, we know Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we add 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two waterslides: the biggest one is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet per minute, while the second biggest slide is 240 feet long but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet per minute.

To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed of the slide. For the biggest slide, the time is 300 / 60 = 5 minutes. For the second biggest slide, the time is 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides. This is simply 5 - 3 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Hey there, let's break down Bobby's daily routine. He takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 

First, we need to find the total time spent on breaks. Since he takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, that's 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add the lunch time to the break time. 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so we can calculate Micah's miles by multiplying 8 by 3.5.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down Sheila's credit card transactions step by step.

First, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. Then, she returned one item that cost $15.00. This means we need to subtract the return from the initial charge.

Initial charge: $85.00
Return: -$15.00
New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. We calculate the discount similarly.

Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, we add the prices of the frying pan and the towels to find the total cost of the new purchases.

Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

Finally, we add the total cost of the new purchases to the previous balance to find the new balance on Sheila's credit card.

New balance: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's dive into the problem. We have a jellyfish tank with an unknown number of jellyfish. We know that a fifth of them are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The rest of the jellyfish are small and always stay blue.

When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. This means that these 6 jellyfish are a third of the large jellyfish. So, we can set up an equation to find the total number of jellyfish.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6.

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's figure out how old Caroline is. We know Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris. To find Ben's age, we multiply Chris's age by 2:
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate Lauren's annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, her annual savings will be:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

Next, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary in retirement, her annual retirement income will be:

Annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

Total savings needed = Annual retirement income * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Now, we need to calculate how many years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of $20,000 per year:

Number of years = Total savings needed / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he needs to cut into 4 equal parts, and then each of those parts will be cut into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each final cut, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Now, we take the result and divide it by the number of parts each of those will be cut into: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long."
"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can find the total number of students by dividing the number of boys by the decimal equivalent of 40%.

40% as a decimal is 0.4. 

Now, let's divide the number of boys by this decimal: 240 / 0.4 = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"Hey, I can help you figure out how much your mom spent at the gardening shop. To do that, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the coupon discount.

The cost of the pots is $19, and the cost of the garden soil is $26. So, the total cost before the discount is $19 + $26 = $45.

Now, let's subtract the $7 discount from the total cost. $45 - $7 = $38.

So, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and divide it by the total number of women.

There are 3 women wearing 4 inch heels and 3 women wearing 2 inch heels. 

The total height of the 4 inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2 inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The total number of women is 3 + 3 = 6.

The average height of heels is the total height divided by the total number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"Soledad is planning to hike 9,300 miles in June, but she can only hike 250 miles per day (twice a day, 125 miles each time). To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total number of days in June, which is 30.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

First, we need to find out how much money Anna spent on the books. She had $16 left after spending $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12. After buying the 2 books, she had $2 left, so she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

"Let's break down the information given. Tate initially has 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. He then buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies. The initial number of male guppies is 4, and he buys 2 more, so the total number of male guppies is 4 + 2 = 6. The initial number of female guppies is 7, and he buys 1 more, so the total number of female guppies is 7 + 1 = 8.

Next, let's calculate the total number of male and female goldfishes. The initial number of male goldfishes is 3, and he buys 2 more, so the total number of male goldfishes is 3 + 2 = 5. The initial number of female goldfishes is 5, and he buys 3 more, so the total number of female goldfishes is 5 + 3 = 8.

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes. The total number of male fishes is 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11. The total number of female fishes is 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16.

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes: 16 - 11 = 5.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, John visits his parents twice a month, and it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph. To find out how many miles he drives in a month, we need to calculate the total distance of a round trip.

First, let's find the distance of a one-way trip:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Now, since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 4 workers who produce toys at different rates. 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work for 10 hours.

First, let's find the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers in 10 hours. The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. 

The total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 10 hours is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. The fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys, which is 420 - 200 = 220 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour is 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 22"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we can find its weight by dividing 60 by 4. 

60 / 4 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we can find its weight by dividing 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30 pounds

Now, we need to find the total weight of all the dogs. We have Elijah's two dogs, which weigh 15 pounds and 30 pounds, and Kory's dog, which weighs 60 pounds. 

15 + 30 + 60 = 105 pounds

The final answer is: 105"

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question. So, John buys 3 large bags of M&M's, each weighing 10 ounces. We know that an ounce of M&M's contains 30 M&M's. To find out how many small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's he has.

First, let's find the total number of ounces of M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Now, let's multiply the total number of ounces by the number of M&M's per ounce: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Since each small bag contains 10 M&M's, we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can divide the total distance (20,000 km) by the distance he flies per day (400 km) to find out how many days it will take him to fly that distance.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Rani's into sports cars, right? She's trying to figure out what the fastest car ever made can go. I helped her dig up some info. Apparently, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which can go 120 miles per hour.

To find the speed of the faster car, we need to start with the average car's speed. Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, its speed is 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we know the 2nd fastest car's speed, so we can find the faster car's speed. The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so its speed is 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"Let's figure out how old Vince is. 

First, we need to find out how old Liam was two years ago. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Now, we know that two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so we can denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A and Madeline as M, and we can say A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so C + S = 30.

Additionally, we know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so C = S + 12.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S + 12 + S = 30, which simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them into boxes of 8 crayons each. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

To find the total weight of the boxes, we need to know how many boxes Nik will need. We can find this by dividing the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of their individual weights: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question.

To find out how much John makes from cutting down the tree, we need to break it down step by step.

First, John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree. That's 80% of 80, which is 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet.

Since each log is 4 feet, we divide 64 by 4 to find the number of logs. 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

From each log, John cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5. 16 * 5 = 80 planks.

Now, John sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank. 80 * 1.2 = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.
2. Valerie's brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, so her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.
3. Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so their mother earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.
5. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

"Let's break down Grandma's walk into two parts: the beach and the sidewalk. We know she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach is given as 40 minutes.

Let's assume her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

The time spent on the beach can be calculated as distance/speed = 2/x. This is equal to 40 minutes. So, 2/x = 40.

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Jane has been saving $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks. To figure out how many more weeks it'll take her to save a total of $60, we need to calculate how much she's saved so far and then determine how much more she needs to save.

She's been saving $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she's saved is $4 * 8 = $32.

Now, let's find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it'll take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, Bob will have 60 + 24 = 84 marbles after receiving 2 dozen more marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles. Let's call the number of marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles 'x'. Then, x + 24 = 84. To find 'x', we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 84 - 24 = 60.

Now that we know Bob has 60 marbles before receiving 2 dozen more marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 60: 60 - 10 = 50.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We have two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature, x. Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. After this, he's able to drink the water, which means the temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees.

To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to find the minimum value of x that satisfies this condition. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. Since Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, the total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5.

Since the temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the inequality:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

(33 + x) * 5 >= 80

Next, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

165 + 5x >= 80

Now, we can subtract 165 from both sides of the inequality to isolate the term with x:

5x >= -85

Finally, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 5 to solve for x:

x >= -17

However, since x represents a temperature, it cannot be negative. Therefore, the minimum value of x is 40 degrees.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. We need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately after three weeks.

First, let's find the number of cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 21 days in three weeks, the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows. Adding this to the initial 50 cows, we get 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows.

Next, let's find the number of chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. The total number of chickens added in three weeks is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens. Adding this to the initial 20 chickens, we get 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.

Now, we add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks. Total number of animals = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Russell orders his favorite bagels online, and each pack costs $10.00 with 9 bagels inside. If he orders 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount. I want to find out how much each single bagel will cost him.

First, I'll calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels. Since each pack costs $10.00, I multiply that by 4.
Total cost of 4 packs = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Now, I need to find 10% of $40.00 to apply the discount.
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00

Next, I'll subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted price.
Discounted cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell orders 4 packs, I'll find the total number of bagels.
Total number of bagels = 4 * 9 = 36

Now, I'll divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost of each single bagel.
Cost of each single bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. It's given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. It's given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. Let's first find out how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

Now, we know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops. To find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops, we need to find out how many groups of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops. 18 / 2 = 9. 

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, it takes 3 * 9 = 27 potatoes to make 18 scoops.

First, we need to find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquet per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to get the number of bouquets sold per day.

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 12 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets.

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Next, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold per day from the individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from the sunflowers per day, we can divide $26 by $2 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day.

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can add the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Adam has $100 to invest in his rock stand. He buys rocks for $5 each and sells them for $7 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * $5 = $100

However, Adam only made $84 from selling the rocks. To find out how much money he loses, we need to consider the cost of the rocks he didn't sell. Since he sold 12 rocks, he has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Let's denote the number of seashells Carlos collected as C. Then, Jim collected C + 5 seashells. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, we can write the equation: C + 5 = 27. Solving for C, we get C = 22.

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as R. Then, Carlos collected 2R seashells. We already know that Carlos collected 22 seashells, so we can write the equation: 2R = 22. Solving for R, we get R = 11.

Now we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells.

They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. The total number of seashells is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60. To find out how many seashells each person gets, we divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people):

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is 60% as a decimal). 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes and 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Linus bought a mobile device for $20 and sold it for twice the amount of the original price, which is $40. 

On Monday, he bought 2 devices, so the total cost price is 2 * $20 = $40. The total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. Therefore, the profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, he bought 4 devices, so the total cost price is 4 * $20 = $80. The total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. Therefore, the profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

To find the total profit, we add the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Carla has 8 identical octuplets, and she dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue.

First, we need to find out how many babies are wearing purple and how many are wearing blue. To do this, we multiply the total number of babies by the fraction of each color.

Number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2

Next, we need to find out how many babies wearing purple and blue are also wearing bows. We know that 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows, so we multiply the number of purple babies by 1/3.

Number of babies wearing purple and bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2
Number of babies wearing blue and bows: 2

Now, we add the number of purple and blue babies wearing bows to get the total number of babies wearing bows.

Total number of babies wearing bows: 2 + 2 = 4

Finally, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple by dividing the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiplying by 100.

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

So, the answer is 50%."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: 1125"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Abraham starts with 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of it for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of that is 26 / 2 = 13.

Now, we need to subtract 10 from 13 to find Geb's age. 

13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first determine how many face masks he uses in a day. Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2.

6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. 

First, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's consider the number of eggs found by each person:

- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs found by all the people, we add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of apartments. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life.

First, we know that a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits. 

A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.

A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.

A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.

A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can find the production of a 10-year-old tree: x = 1000. 

So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

The final answer is: 2350"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, let's figure out how much money Jack has now. Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100. To find out how much that is, we need to divide $100 by 5.

$100 / 5 = $20.

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three ropes: red, blue, and yellow. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. We know that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can express the combined length of the ropes as R + B + Y = 37. Substituting R = 4B into this equation, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Now, substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37. This gives us 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37. Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12. Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. If Ronnie was given $5, then Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.
(15 - x) = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question.

So, let's dive into the problem. We have a wall mural with four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. Half the mural is yellow. If the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, how many pints of red paint was used?

Let's break it down. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the area of one bedroom. The dimensions of each bedroom are 20 by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

Next, we need to find the area of the living room. It's mentioned that the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Now, we know the area of the rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question. So, Alice likes to count the puffs of clouds in the sky while she eats her lunch outside at school. On Monday, she counts just 3 puffs of clouds. Each day after that through Friday, though, she sees double the number of clouds in the sky as the day before.

Let's break it down. On Monday, Alice counts 3 clouds. On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds. On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds. On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds. On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"Hey there, let's dive into this problem. We have a regular box of 100 dishwasher pods that costs $12. There's a special size box for the same price that has 20% more pods. 

First, we need to find out how many pods are in the new box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days he can use the chalk after Monday.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the number of girls and boys on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, James has 30 teeth, and his dentist is quite busy. The dentist drills 4 of them, which is a pretty standard procedure, I guess. But then, the dentist goes above and beyond by capping 7 more teeth than he drills. That's some serious dental work right there.

To find out what percentage of James' teeth the dentist fixes, we need to add up the number of teeth he drills and caps. So, the dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 11 teeth (4 + 7). That's a total of 15 teeth fixed.

Now, to find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth fixed (15) by the total number of teeth James has (30), and then multiply by 100. That gives us (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

"Hey, let's break down the problem. Bob has $27,000 to spend on books for 3 schools. He can buy 100 books for $500. 

First, we need to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with the money he has. To do that, we'll divide the total amount of money by the cost of 100 books.

Total books = $27,000 / $500
Total books = 54

Now that we know Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since he's distributing the money to 3 schools, we'll divide the total number of books by 3.

Books per school = 54 / 3
Books per school = 18

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Kate's 6 friends each eat 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. To figure out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's start by calculating the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat.

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out how long it'll take Jay to get 60 snowballs for his snowball fight with his sister.

Let's break it down. Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, which is 60 minutes. That's a rate of 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. That's a rate of 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate of snowballs, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: (1/3) - (2/15). To do this, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So, we convert 1/3 to 5/15. Now we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how long it'll take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Time = Number of snowballs / Rate = 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

So, it'll take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 50 / 2 = 25).
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages (since they ordered 1 pack of 50).
After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages.
After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100 bandages (since they ordered 2 packs of 50).

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours. To find her regular pay, we multiply her total hours by her hourly rate: 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Now, let's consider her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

To find her total earnings, we add her regular pay and attendance bonus: $270 + $240 = $510.

The final answer is: $510"
"Let's break down Jason's earnings for the two-week period.

For doing his laundry, Jason earns $3.00, and he did it once, so that's $3.00.

He also earns $1.50 for cleaning his room, and he did it once, so that's $1.50.

For taking the trash out, Jason earns $0.75, and he did it twice, so that's $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.

Lastly, he earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher, and he did it 6 times, so that's $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up the earnings: $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Brady learned that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. And, she also found out that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. To find out how much blood ten sharks have, we need to figure out how much blood one shark has first.

Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. 

Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 

Finally, 3 times the number of people who entered in the morning came in, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time:
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) = 90
90 + 80 (lunch) = 170
170 + 150 (evening) = 320

The final answer is: 320"
"So, Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. That means she bought 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Now, let's talk about the black pens. Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, she bought 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for a total of $600, so the cost per bottle is $600 / 10 = $60.

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

Now, we need to find the total number of bottles of cognac. The problem states that John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so the number of bottles of cognac is 2 * 10 = 20.

The total cost of the cognac is the cost per bottle multiplied by the number of bottles, which is $90 * 20 = $1800.

Finally, we need to find the total cost of everything. This is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac, which is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees separately and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Lodgepole Pine: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the events and calculate the remaining root beer.

Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

Then, his wife accidentally spilled 7 gallons, reducing the amount to 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

Next, his friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Finally, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people: 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a total of 66 fish in the tank. 

First, we need to find the number of fish with red stripes. One-third of the fish have red stripes, so we'll divide 66 by 3.

66 / 3 = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish that don't have red stripes. We'll subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

66 - 22 = 44

Next, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish, which have blue stripes.

(5/11) * 44 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes. We'll add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

22 + 20 = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, which means she had a total of 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one palette, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Mattison's height is 60 inches. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Next, we're told that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, to find the height of the second floor, we subtract the first floor's height from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the second floor is 240 inches. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house: 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

The final answer is: 180"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 700 shells in total, and team Alphas found 40% of them. To find 40% of 700, we multiply 0.4 by 700.

0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. 

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Bernie has 4 dogs, and they need to walk a total of 12 miles on average per day. The first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second needs to walk 4 miles, and the third needs to walk 3 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all 4 dogs. 

First, let's add up the miles walked by the first three dogs: 
1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles.

Now, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all 4 dogs: 
12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

The last dog needs 4 miles."
"Hey there, let's break down John's situation. He's mortgaging his house, which is worth $250,000. He gets a loan for 40% of that amount. 

First, we need to find 40% of $250,000. To do that, we multiply 0.4 by $250,000. 

0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. We find 60% by multiplying 0.6 by $100,000.

0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To find out how much money John has leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the amount borrowed.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Deandre caught 3 tunas last Monday. The first one weighs 56 kilograms, the second one weighs 46 kilograms, and the last one weighs 26 kilograms. If a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, let's calculate how much he'll earn after selling all the tunas to the market.

To find the total weight of the tunas, we need to add the weights of all three tunas. 

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 
The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the dehumidifier has three settings: low, medium, and high. The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, the medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting, and the high setting removes twice as much as the medium setting.

The medium setting removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day, and the high setting removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.

Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

Next, he ran it for 3 days on the medium setting, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

Finally, he ran it for 5 days on the high setting, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

To find the total amount of water removed, we add the amounts from each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Jolene and her friends are having a water balloon fight to kick off summer. They filled up 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons. 

To find out how many balloons they had in total, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack: 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.

Now, we know that 12 balloons were left by the end of the afternoon. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total: 300 - 12 = 288.

The final answer is: 288"
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

"To find the capacity of John's classes, we need to find 1/8 of Ali's class capacity. 

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. 
1/8 of 120 is 120 / 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 
Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. 

First, we need to calculate the interest he owes. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

Now, we need to find the remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. This is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you solve the problem.

To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume. 

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed. 

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of Pauline's visits to the museum for the first 5 years. Since she visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

Next, we need to find the total cost of Pauline's visits to the museum for the next 3 years. After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

Now, we can find the total cost for all visits by adding the cost of the first 5 years and the cost of the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

The top 10 students in each grade get to try an escape room set up by the teachers. However, only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, and they have 45 minutes to try and escape.

To figure out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from 10 students in each grade. There are 4 grades, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many groups can be formed: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, and there are 5 groups, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you solve the problem.

Let's say the length of the shorter piece is x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Aiden's making his famous steakhouse-seasoned meatballs for a neighborhood cookout. He adds two tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef he uses. He gets sixteen meatballs from each pound of meat. If he wants to make 80 meatballs for the cookout, how much of his secret seasoning will he need?

To figure this out, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, so we can multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total seasoning needed.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"Let's break down the costs for Karen's salon visit. A basic manicure starts at $35, and a pedicure starts at $40. If she chooses to get both, the salon offers a 20% discount on the total cost.

First, calculate the discount on the manicure and pedicure. The discount on the manicure is 20% of $35, which is 0.2 * 35 = $7. The discount on the pedicure is 20% of $40, which is 0.2 * 40 = $8.

The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15.

The cost of the manicure after the discount is $35 - $7 = $28.
The cost of the pedicure after the discount is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie charges $80 per hour. So, the total amount from these lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie charges 75% of his standard rate, which is $80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour. Since he has 2 of these lessons, the total amount from the reduced rate lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we add the amounts from the standard and reduced rate lessons: $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. I'd be happy to help you find Sally's mean score.

To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores. Let's start by adding up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630. There are 9 scores in total. Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we need to determine what 1/4 of 20 is.

To find 1/4 of 20, we multiply 20 by 1/4: 20 * (1/4) = 5. This means Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

Since Eve originally had 20 pomelos and is left with 5, the number of pomelos she gave away is the difference between the original amount and the remaining amount: 20 - 5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Walter bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them. To find out how many apples he ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining.

60 - 24 = 36

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25.

25% of 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple.

The amount of money he received = 27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: $81"
"Let's break down the problem. Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year. To find the total number of novels she wrote this year, we need to determine what 1 quarter of the novels is and then multiply it by 4.

Since 9 novels is 3 quarters, we can find 1 quarter by dividing 9 by 3.

9 / 3 = 3

Now, we multiply 3 by 4 to find the total number of novels she wrote this year.

3 * 4 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, let's break down the problem. Michael is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, and he's been on the road for 3 days. We need to find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas he's covered.

First, we need to calculate the total hours he's been driving. Since there are 24 hours in a day, he's been driving for 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, let's find the distance he's covered. We can do this by multiplying his speed by the time he's been driving.

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance covered = 3600 km

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is 36 / 12 = 3 pies.

Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) + 36 (by their mother) = 102 grapes.

Since the total number of grapes used is 102, the initial number of grapes is 102.

The final answer is: $\boxed{102}$"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were not sick to the number of substitute teachers.

First, let's find the number of teachers who were not sick. There were 82 teachers in total, and 13 of them were sick. So, the number of teachers not sick is 82 - 13 = 69.

Now, we add the number of substitute teachers, which is 9, to the number of teachers not sick. 69 + 9 = 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. 
The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.
The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of the macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00 per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find out what percentage of their day the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we first need to determine the total time they have to clean and the total time it takes to clean all the classrooms.

The custodian has 5 days to clean the school. Since they work 8 hours a day, the total time they have is 5 * 8 = 40 hours.

The total time it takes to clean all 80 classrooms is 80 * 15 minutes = 1200 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1200 / 60 = 20 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 / 40) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help Elly figure out how many bookcases she needs to hold all her books. 

Let's start by determining the capacity of each shelf. The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase: 
Middle shelf 1 + Middle shelf 2 + Bottom shelf + Top shelf = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are needed to hold all of them. To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 
110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the eggs. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen, we multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen.

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's find out how much she can sell the eggs for. She will sell it for $1 for 3 eggs. To find the total revenue, we need to determine how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell.

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since she sells each set for $1, the total revenue will be:

20 sets * $1/set = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Skyler has 100 hats in total. Half of them are red, which is 100 * 0.5 = 50 red hats.

Now, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red ones. That would be 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 50 by 3/5, which is 50 * (3/5) = 30 blue hats.

Now, we know that the remaining hats are white. So, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is: 20"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Archie buys beef jerky that comes in bags of 30 sticks and costs $18.00 per bag. If he buys one bag while they're offering a $3.00 discount, how much will each stick of jerky cost in cents?

First, we need to find the total cost of the bag after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Now, let's convert the discounted price to cents: $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents.

Next, we need to find the cost of each stick of jerky. There are 30 sticks per bag, and the cost per bag in cents is 1500. To find the cost per stick, we divide the cost per bag by the number of sticks: 1500 / 30 = 50 cents.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Audrey has to take two math tests to pass 6th grade. She needs to get 70% of the total questions right to move on to 7th grade. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. The second test has 40 questions.

First, let's find out how many questions she got right on the first test. 60% of 70 questions is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. The total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110. She needs to get 70% of 110 questions right. 70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since she got 42 questions right on the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Mary makes some strawberry cubes and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. We also know that she makes a total of 116 ice cubes.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We can express the relationship between the number of blueberry cubes and strawberry cubes as B = 5S - 4.

Since the total number of ice cubes is 116, we can write the equation S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B into the equation, we get S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

The final answer is: 96"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Ara joined the school basketball team four years ago and has been playing 40 games every year. If her score for every game is 21 points, let's calculate the total number of points she has scored in the four years.

First, we need to find out how many points she scores in a year. To do that, we multiply the number of games she plays each year by her score per game.

Number of games per year: 40
Score per game: 21 points

Total points per year = 40 games/year * 21 points/game = 840 points/year

Now, we need to find the total points she scored in four years. We can do this by multiplying the total points per year by the number of years.

Number of years: 4

Total points in 4 years = 840 points/year * 4 years = 3360 points

The final answer is: 3360"
"Let's break down the situation with Brendan and his marbles. He started with 10 marbles. Then, he dropped half of them, which means he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left. After that, he found 3 more marbles, so now he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. However, one of the marbles he picked up was actually a bead, not a marble, so he got rid of it. This leaves him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

"To figure out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that for every 2 customers that come into the car dealership, 1 will buy a car. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the car dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 person comes into the car dealership. To get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"Let's break down the situation. There are 8 rooms in Brianna's house, and her family has a flashlight for each person. Since there are 4 people, they have a total of 4 flashlights.

Now, let's count the candles. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

To find the total number of light sources, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Dominick went to his team's changing room and saw some robots, helmets, and footballs. He noticed that there were half as many robots as helmets, and half as many helmets as footballs. If there were 20 helmets, let's figure out the total number of items Dominick saw.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Now, we know there are half as many helmets as footballs, so the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together: 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"Hey there, let's break down Tim's phone call situation. He spends 6 hours each day at work, and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. First, we need to convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

To find out how many calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5: 24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Louise is an artist, and she's trying out a new varnish for her paintings. The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, but the new varnish takes 12 minutes. She's working on 6 paintings, and I need to figure out how much longer it'll take for the new varnish to dry compared to the old one.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for the old varnish to dry on all 6 paintings. That's 7 minutes per painting, so 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

Now, let's do the same for the new varnish. It takes 12 minutes per painting, so 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

To find the difference, I'll subtract the old time from the new time: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

So, the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry on all 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have five phones on a phone plan, and the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. The main phone costs $20.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question. So, John's normally speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After some intense training, his speed increased to 2.5 times his original speed. That's a pretty impressive improvement.

To find his new speaking speed, I'll multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, let's calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, I'll divide the total number of words by John's new speaking speed.

Time = Total words / New speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 hours

So, it would take John 12 hours to speak 10 pages at his new speed.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you with your question. Let's break it down step by step.

Conor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun. On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were present at the beach than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Garrett is popping popcorn, and we need to find the total number of pieces he has to eat.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to three times the initial amount, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial popping rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Tim's planning a pool party and he needs to make some lemonade. He's got a recipe that calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon of lemonade. He's found out that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. He's planning to make 4 gallons for the party, but his friend Allen asked him to make an extra gallon that's twice as tart as the other gallons.

First, let's figure out how many gallons of lemonade Tim needs to make in total. He's making 4 gallons for the party and 1 extra gallon for Allen, so that's 5 gallons in total.

Now, since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, we need to find out how many cups of juice are needed for 5 gallons. That's 5 cups.

The extra tart lemonade requires twice the amount of lemon juice, so that's 2 cups. We need to find out how many lemons are needed for this extra tart lemonade. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade as follows: 2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons.

Now, let's find out how many lemons are needed for the regular lemonade. We need 5 cups of juice for 5 gallons, and since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for the regular lemonade as follows: 5 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 5/6 * 6 = 5 lemons.

So, in total, Tim needs 2 lemons for the extra tart lemonade and 5 lemons for the regular lemonade, which is a total of 7 lemons.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption of dog food for the German Shepherds: 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day.

Next, let's calculate the daily consumption of dog food for the Bulldogs: 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day.

Now, we add the daily consumption of both breeds to get the total daily consumption: 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day.

To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 10 animals with 2 legs each and 15 animals with 4 legs each. 

First, we calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs.

Next, we calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of animals: 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs.

Since the question asks for pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs: 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem. We know there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, which means there are 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12 blocks.

Since there are 32 blocks in total, we can find the number of red blocks by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 
32 - 12 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down Elvis's journey. He travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph. To find the distance traveled west, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.

Then, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed. To find the distance traveled east, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far he is from his house now. 

The distance traveled west is 90 miles, and the distance traveled east is 144 miles. The difference is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's break down the depreciation of the boat over the three years.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, it depreciated by 30%, which means it lost 30% of its value. To find the depreciation amount, we multiply the initial value by 0.3: 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. So, the value after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%. We apply the same calculation: 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. Subtracting this from the value after the first year, we get $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciated by 20%. We calculate the depreciation as 0.2 * $4410 = $882. Subtracting this from the value after the second year, we get $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out the number of pink candies in the bag.

Let's break it down step by step. We know the bag has 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies. Out of these, 54 are red. Now, we're told that there are twice as many orange candies as red candies. So, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

Next, we're given that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. That means the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag: 232 - 189 = 43.

The final answer is: 43"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Helen went on a trip to Germany and booked a hotel for 3 nights. She also rode the bus 7 times during that trip. One night at the hotel cost $80, and every bus trip was 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.

To find the total cost of the hotel, we need to multiply the cost of one night by the number of nights. The cost of one night at the hotel is $80, and Helen stayed for 3 nights, so the total cost of the hotel is $80 * 3 = $240.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the bus trips. The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8. Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we add the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips. So, $240 + $56 = $296.

The final answer is: $296"
"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you figure out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla.

Mazie has 52 marbles to give away to her twins, Dallas and Darla. We know that Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them in the playground. To find out how many marbles Dallas initially had, we need to add the marbles he dropped back to the marbles he has now.

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so he must have had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles initially.

Now, we know that Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas received 25. To find out how many marbles Darla received, we can subtract 25 from 52.

52 - 25 = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."
"Let's break down the costs for the family's cinema trip. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets. There are two adult tickets at $12 each, so that's 2 * $12 = $24. Then, there's a child ticket for $8. 

Next, we have the cost of the popcorns. They bought 2 popcorns for $3 each, so that's 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $24 (tickets) + $8 (child ticket) + $6 (popcorns) = $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add their individual weights together. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each. 

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

Force = 1% * 1600
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

The final answer is: 16"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, James wants to hang some crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. To figure out how much crepe paper he needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all four sides.

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Mia and Emma are 16 years apart in age, and Mia is 40 years old. To find Emma's age, I'll just add 16 to Mia's age. That makes Emma 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

Now, to find the average of their ages, I'll add their ages together and divide by 2. So, the average age is (40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48.

"Let's count the good seashells. Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432 seashells, and Benny found 86 seashells. When they cleaned them, they discovered that 67 were cracked.

To find the total number of good seashells, we need to add the number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Total seashells found = 214 (Tom) + 432 (Nancy) + 86 (Benny) = 732
Total cracked seashells = 67

Total good seashells = Total seashells found - Total cracked seashells
Total good seashells = 732 - 67
Total good seashells = 665

The final answer is: 665"
"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then multiply it by the number of people.

Dinner plates cost $6.00 each and Avery needs 12 plates, so the total cost of dinner plates is 6 * 12 = $72.

Bowls cost $5.00 each and Avery needs 12 bowls, so the total cost of bowls is 5 * 12 = $60.

Salad plates cost $4.00 each and Avery needs 12 salad plates, so the total cost of salad plates is 4 * 12 = $48.

The total cost of the place settings is the sum of the cost of dinner plates, bowls, and salad plates: 72 + 60 + 48 = $180.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much feed the pigs eat in a day. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed they eat per day is 5 * 8 = 40 pounds.

In a week, there are 7 days, so the total amount of feed they eat in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the amount eaten from the total amount ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, John invited 20 people to a birthday party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. He already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. To figure out how much he needs to spend on hot dogs, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over, so we subtract those from the total required:
Total hot dogs required: 40 - 4 = 36

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:
36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
6 * 2 = 12

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down Frances' sales and expenses. She sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each, so her total earnings from cupcakes are 20 * $2 = $40. She also sells 40 cookies for $1 each, which gives her 40 * $1 = $40. Adding these together, her total earnings are $40 + $40 = $80.

Frances buys five trays at $4 each, so her total expenses are 5 * $4 = $20.

To find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings: $80 - $20 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Mamou is trying to help out her country by distributing meals to the affected families. She has a total of 1,360 meals to give out. On Friday, she gave out 64 meals, on Saturday she gave out 30 meals, and on Sunday she gave out 48 meals.

To find out how many meals she has left, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has. 

First, let's add up the meals she gave out: 64 + 30 + 48 = 142

Now, let's subtract the total meals given out from the total meals Mamou has: 1,360 - 142 = 1,218

So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute."

"Let's break down the information given. We have 2 brothers and 3 sisters in the family. The sisters are all the same age, which is 16 years old. One of the brothers is 12 years old, and this is half the age of the older brother.

Since one brother is 12 years old, the older brother must be 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

The total age of the 3 sisters is 16 * 3 = 48 years.

The total age of the 2 brothers is 12 + 24 = 36 years.

To find the total age of all the siblings, we add the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters: 48 + 36 = 84 years.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down Charisma's daily routine. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, which adds up to 30 minutes per day. Since she does this every day, the weekly meditation time is 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

Charisma also practices yoga for 1 hour, or 60 minutes, 5 days a week. So, her weekly yoga time is 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week, we add the two together: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks: 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of holes dug by the dog. Since the dog digs 6 holes a day and Nate was on vacation for 14 days, we multiply the number of holes dug per day by the number of days.

Holes dug per day = 6
Days Nate was on vacation = 14
Total holes dug = 6 * 14 = 84

However, the dog digs 6 new holes every night, so we need to add these to the total holes dug during the day. Since Nate fills the holes for the same number of days he was on vacation, we'll assume he fills the holes for 14 days.

Holes dug at night = 6 * 14 = 84
Total holes = 84 + 84 = 168

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 / 3
Days to fill holes = 56

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7.

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 8

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: This statement is incorrect, but we can infer that Igor gathered 2 more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested. So, if he gathered 2 more test tubes than Petri dishes, then he gathered 14 - 2 = 12 Petri dishes.
- Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 12 Petri dishes = 27 items.

Since Igor had 29 items on the lab bench, he must have lost 29 - 27 = 2 beakers.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, James is putting together 4 tables, and each table has 4 legs with 2 screws per leg. To find out how many screws he needs in total, we multiply the number of legs by the number of screws per leg, and then multiply that by the number of tables.

So, 4 legs per table * 2 screws per leg = 8 screws per table. Then, 8 screws per table * 4 tables = 32 screws in total.

Now, James has 40 screws, and he needs 32 screws for the tables. To find out how many screws he'll have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's count the eggs. We have 10 eggs in the first basket. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, we need to multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2 to find the number of eggs in the second basket.

10 eggs * 2 = 20 eggs in the second basket.

Now, let's add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Alexandra raises $430. Since Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, we can calculate Kim's amount by adding $320 to Alexandra's amount: $430 + $320 = $750.

Next, we know that Sarah raises $300. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so we can calculate Maryam's amount by adding $400 to Sarah's amount: $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes, Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x minutes.

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance of Vanessa (since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron), we can set up the equation:

x * 2 = 16 (since Aaron ran half the distance of Vanessa, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile:
Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. 

Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3: 
200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

He already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total amount needed: 
600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

First, we need to find the daily revenue. Since each reservation includes 2 meals and a bottle of wine, the cost per reservation is (2 * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15.

Now, we multiply the cost per reservation by the number of reservations to get the daily revenue: $15 * 6 = $90.

Since Tom's restaurant is open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days they are open to get the weekly revenue: $90 * 2 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, you want to know how much each watermelon was sold for. Let's break it down.

The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold them all at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total selling price of all the watermelons.

The profit percentage is 25%, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit). 

Let's find the cost price of 1 watermelon: 
Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

Now, let's find the selling price of 1 watermelon:
Selling price of 50 watermelons = 125% of $80
Selling price of 50 watermelons = (125/100) * $80 = $100
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John had James when he was 19. This means the time that has passed since then is 18 - 19 = -1 year. However, since age cannot be negative, this means the information given is inconsistent.

But let's continue with the problem and find the current age of John's youngest son. John was 32 when his youngest son was born, so his youngest son's current age is 32. In 3 years, his age will be 32 + 3 = 35 years.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's break down the problem. Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange, and Jane takes 4 minutes to do the same. We want to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 60 by the time it takes Ana to peel an orange, which is 3 minutes. This gives us 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Next, we calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour. We divide 60 by the time it takes Jane to peel an orange, which is 4 minutes. This gives us 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled: 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. So, Mark's car broke down and he needs a new radiator. He finds one at a junk shop, but it's not cheap. The original price is $400, but he gets it for 80% off. That's a pretty sweet deal.

To find the cost of the radiator after the discount, I'll calculate the discount amount first. The discount is 80% of the original price, which is 400 * 0.8 = $320. So, the discount amount is $320.

Now, I'll subtract the discount from the original price to get the cost of the radiator. That's 400 - 320 = $80.

Next, Mark needs to hire a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * 50 = $150.

To find the total cost, I'll add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost. That's 80 + 150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals on his farm, and they are all either chickens or cows. We also know that the total number of legs is 70.

Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. Let's use the variable C to represent the number of chickens and W to represent the number of cows.

We can write two equations based on the given information:

1. C + W = 20 (the total number of animals)
2. 2C + 4W = 70 (the total number of legs)

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Now, substitute this expression for W into the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

So, the number of chickens on the farm is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Hey, I'm Kai. So, Henry and his friends want to share 7 pizzas that are cut into 8 slices each. To figure out how many slices each person can have, we need to find the total number of slices first. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). So, we divide 56 by 4 to get the number of slices each person can have.

56 / 4 = 14

The final answer is: 14"
