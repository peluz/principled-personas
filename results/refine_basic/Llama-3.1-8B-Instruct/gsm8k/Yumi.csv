"Let's break down Janet's daily egg sales. She lays 16 eggs per day. For breakfast, she eats 3 eggs, and she bakes 4 eggs for her friends. 

To find out how many eggs she has left, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 

So, she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber required. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half that much white fiber, we calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Josh decided to flip a house, and he bought it for $80,000. Then, he put in $50,000 in repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. Let's calculate the profit he made.

First, we need to find the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house was $80,000, and the repairs increased its value by 150%. To find the new value, we multiply the original value by 1.5 (which is the same as 150%).
New value = $80,000 * 1.5
New value = $120,000 + $80,000
New value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, James wants to know how many meters he runs in a week. He does 3 sprints 3 times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters. To find the total meters he runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Let's start by finding the total meters he runs in one session. Since he runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Now, we know James runs 3 times a week, so we multiply the total meters he runs in one session by the number of sessions he has in a week:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

So, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon. 

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"I'd be happy to help Kylar figure out how much he needs to pay for the glasses. 

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8, which is 0.6 * $1.8 = $1.08. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time. 

Let's find the pattern: 
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $3.
- The third glass costs $3 * 0.6 = $1.8.
- The fourth glass costs $1.8 * 0.6 = $1.08.
- The fifth glass costs $1.08 * 0.6 = $0.648.
- The sixth glass costs $0.648 * 0.6 = $0.3888.
- The seventh glass costs $0.3888 * 0.6 = $0.23328.
- The eighth glass costs $0.23328 * 0.6 = $0.139968.
- The ninth glass costs $0.139968 * 0.6 = $0.0839856.
- The tenth glass costs $0.0839856 * 0.6 = $0.05039136.
- The eleventh glass costs $0.05039136 * 0.6 = $0.030234816.
- The twelfth glass costs $0.030234816 * 0.6 = $0.0181407896.
- The thirteenth glass costs $0.0181407896 * 0.6 = $0.01088447476.
- The fourteenth glass costs $0.01088447476 * 0.6 = $0.006530684856.
- The fifteenth glass costs $0.006530684856 * 0.6 = $0.0039184109136.
- The sixteenth glass costs $0.0039184109136 * 0.6 = $0.0023610469456.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.648 + $0.3888 + $0.23328 + $0.139968 + $0.0839856 + $0.05039136 + $0.030234816 + $0.0181407896 + $0.01088447476 + $0.006530684856 + $0.0039184109136 + $0.0023610469456 = $23.016

The total cost is $23.016."
"Let's break down the information given:

Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB. The time to download 120 GB is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. The time to install the updates is 20 minutes. So, the total time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down John's trip into segments to find the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't travel any distance during this time.

Next, John drives at a speed of 30 mph for half an hour. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

After that, John drives at a speed of 80 mph for the remaining 2 hours. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Now, let's add up the distances John traveled in the return trip:

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 160 = 175 miles

Since John is now back home, we need to find the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours. To do this, we need to consider the distance he has traveled in the 4 hours. 

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles

Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

However, this is the total distance he traveled, not the distance from home. To find the distance from home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled in the first 3 hours from the total distance traveled in 4 hours. 

Distance from home = Total distance traveled in 4 hours - Distance traveled in the first 3 hours
Distance from home = 355 - 180
Distance from home = 175 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 * $10 = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the program had 60 downloads in the first month.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

Now, let's calculate the downloads for the third month. The number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 0.3 by 180, which is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 

Now, we subtract 54 from 180 to find the downloads in the third month: 180 - 54 = 126.

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"Let's break down the cost of the pastries Toula bought. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the donuts. Since she bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, the total cost of the donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. She bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen, so the total cost of the cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.

Lastly, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. She bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen, so the total cost of the cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the lemon tree costs $90 to plant and will generate revenue from selling lemons each year. The tree will grow 7 lemons per year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. This means the total revenue generated each year is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5.

However, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, the net revenue each year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to consider the initial cost of the tree and the net revenue it generates each year. We can do this by dividing the initial cost by the net revenue:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.5 (net revenue) = 12 years

Since the tree will start generating revenue in the first year, it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself, but it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with ""x"". So, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

After selling at the green house, she had (x - x/3) = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners left.

She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

After selling at the red house, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2x/3 - 2) is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = (x/3 - 1).

So, she had (2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1)) = (x/3 - 1) vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 4 students.

Now, let's find out how many students are left. We subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students: 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 4 students.

Now, let's find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance. We subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

So, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

"To determine which purchase plan will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each option.

For the jewelry, a 2.5% increase in value would be 0.025 * $5,000 = $125.

For the electronic gadgets, a 1.2% increase in value would be 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Since the jewelry has a higher potential increase in value, the merchant should choose the jewelry.

The profit would be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

So, we have two trains that leave San Rafael at the same time and travel in two different directions. On the first day, they both travel 80 miles westward. The next day, they both travel 150 miles northward.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem helps us find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.

Let's break it down:

Day 1: Both trains travel 80 miles westward.

Day 2: Both trains travel 150 miles northward.

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance covered by each train:

Total distance = √(80^2 + 150^2)
Total distance = √(6400 + 22500)
Total distance = √28900
Total distance = 170 miles

Since both trains travel the same distance, the distance covered by each train is 170 miles.

The final answer is: 170"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you calculate Jill's annual salary.

To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. Jill gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked per year to get the total hours worked per year. 

Total hours worked per year as a teacher: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual earnings from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. Jill gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week as a coach. We multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked per year to get the total hours worked per year.

Total hours worked per year as a coach: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual earnings from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary.

Total annual salary: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks.

First, we need to find out how many days are in 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 by 7 to get the total number of days.

4 weeks * 7 days/week = 28 days

Now, we know Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning. To find out how many eggs she eats in 28 days, we multiply the number of days by the number of eggs she eats per day.

28 days * 3 eggs/day = 84 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens

The final answer is: 7"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail and she's already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire hike. To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining distance, we need to find out how much time she has left to complete the hike.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike, we can find the total time she needs to complete the hike by dividing the total distance by her desired average speed:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since she has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 10 liters of orange drink that is two-thirds water. To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Next, we have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling. The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

However, we spill 1 liter of the orange drink. To find the remaining amount of water, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water. The remaining amount of water is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Since we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange and pineapple drinks. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Samantha is 31 years old, and Raymond was born 6 years before her. This means Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we need to find out how many years have passed since then. To do this, we subtract the age at which he had a son from his current age: 25 - 23 = 2.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, let's break it down step by step. Billy has 8 customers on Tuesday. The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so they buy a total of 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.

The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they buy a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 5 customers, which is 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"Let's calculate how much shorter a candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The candle burns for 4 hours, and it melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour. To find the total melting, we multiply the rate by the time.

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"Let's solve this problem together. We know that Kyle bought last year's best-selling book for $19.50, and this is with a 25% discount from the original price. To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price.

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that cost $3 each, and 4 apples that cost $1.50 each. We need to find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, given that each box costs $8.50 and she paid a total of $50.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples. The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 = $15, and the cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Now, we need to find the cost of the pizza boxes. Since Marie paid a total of $50, we subtract the cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount she paid: $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box to find the number of boxes: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Mishka's shopping spree. She bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. 

One pair of shorts costs $16.50, so 3 pairs will be 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.
One pair of pants costs $22.50, so 3 pairs will be 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.
One pair of shoes costs $42, so 3 pairs will be 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream.

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, and she buys cartons with 15 servings of ice cream per carton at a cost of $4.00 per carton. To find out how much she'll spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days. Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide 60 by 15:
60 / 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

"I'm Yumi, and I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Gloria has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much as the first pair.

Since the more expensive pair of heels costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, we can calculate its cost as 2 * 33 = $66.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the situation. The total cost of the two pairs of heels is the sum of their individual costs, which is 33 + 66. We know that this total is $5 less than the cost of the boots. So, we can write the equation as B = 33 + 66 - 5, where B represents the cost of the boots.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

So, the boots cost $94."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out the average guess of Gunter's friends. 

The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 40 + 20 is 60. 

The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend guesses 80 + 20, which is 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. There are 3 friends, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog requires 0.5 hours of his time every day for walking and taking care of their business. To find out how many hours he spends on the dogs in a week, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 7.

First, let's find the total time spent per day. We can do this by multiplying the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog.

Number of dogs: 10
Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Total time per day = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Total time per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Now, we need to find the total time spent in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total time per day by 7.

Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7
Total time per week = 35 hours

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30. We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the information given about the jewels.

Raymond has 40 jewels. To find out how many jewels Aaron has, we need to calculate half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5 to that number. Half of 40 is 20, and 20 + 5 is 25. So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total. 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Mike's ping pong game. He played for 40 minutes, which is divided into two 20-minute segments. 

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. Now, let's calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. To do this, we need to find 25% of 4 points. 25% is the same as 0.25, so we multiply 4 by 0.25 to get 1 point. 

Now, we add 1 point to the initial 4 points to find the points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Since each set costs $5.00, Terry spends 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. John sells his 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = 195 dollars.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is 8 * 20 = 160 dollars.

John also has $5 left, which means he spent 195 - 5 = 190 dollars on the video games.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $35, which is the amount he used from his own money. 
35 / 15 = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 11 sets with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left.

The final answer is: 11"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down John's running schedule. He runs 60 miles a week and 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. For the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

So, his total running time for the week is 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours. Since he runs 3 days a week, we multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time: 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours.

Now, let's calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"Let's break down Dana's speeds. We know she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half of her running speed. So, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4. That gives us 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's consider the time she spends walking and running. We're told she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Over six hours, she spends 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking and 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running.

To find the distance she travels while walking, we multiply her walking speed by the time she spends walking: 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles. To find the distance she travels while running, we multiply her running speed by the time she spends running: 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

"The great dragon, Perg, sits atop mount Farbo, breathing fire that reaches 1000 feet in all directions. Polly has a gold javelin that can slay the dragon, but it can only be thrown 400 feet when she doesn't hold the sapphire gemstone. However, when she does hold the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than usual.

To find out how far outside the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit it with the javelin, we need to calculate the new distance she can throw the javelin. 

Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"Let's solve the problem together. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon. Each pie was cut into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces.

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume for the day. To do that, we subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams you can eat, we multiply the number of servings you can still have by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's calculate Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to make 20 candles. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 per pound * 2, which equals $20.00.

Next, we need to find the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle is sold for $2.00, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00, which equals $40.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Meredith's article writing schedule.

To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Total number of articles written in 3 days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She then purchased a package of Post-it notes and used 220 of them at work. After that, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to determine the total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package. We can do this by adding the initial Post-it notes and the ones she purchased, then subtracting the ones she used.

Let's call the number of Post-it notes in the package 'x'. The total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package is 80 (initial) + x (package) - 220 (used) + 23 (remaining).

Since the total Post-it notes after purchasing the package is equal to the sum of the initial Post-it notes, the Post-it notes used, and the Post-it notes remaining, we can set up the equation:

x + 23 = 80 + 220 - 23

Simplifying the equation:
x + 23 = 277 - 23
x + 23 = 254
x = 254 - 23
x = 231

The final answer is: 231"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie: 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. We know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the red ties cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

To find the total cost of red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie: 10 * 60 = $600.

Finally, we add the cost of blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together. Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces she obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches.

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can multiply 4 feet by 12 to get the total length in inches:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, let's divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
48 inches / 6 inches = 8

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. There are 15 floors and 8 units per floor, so 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: 120 * 1/4 = 30 units.

"Let's calculate how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week.

First, we need to find out how many eggs are produced per week. His chickens produce 252 eggs per day, and there are 7 days in a week. So, the total number of eggs produced per week is:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens are produced per week:
1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"Let's break down Tom's journey. He travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is a 3-hour period. Since his ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, the distance covered during this time is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

Now, let's calculate the time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour. It's simply 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

For the return journey, the distance remains the same, 30 miles. However, his ship's speed is now 6 mph. To find the time taken for the return journey, we divide the distance by the speed: 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, the total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours (one way) + 5 hours (return journey) = 8 hours.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's help Uriah with his heavy book bag. He needs to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove?

To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys to be removed can be calculated by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the revenue earned from repairing truck tires and car tires on Thursday. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire.

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Next, we need to calculate the revenue earned from repairing car tires on Friday. The mechanic repaired 12 car tires on Friday.

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is: $40"

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges. 20% of 25 oranges is calculated as (20/100) * 25 = 5 oranges.

Now, we add the number of bad and unripe oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

Since we know that 2 oranges are sour, we can add these to the number of oranges that are not good to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 
6 (not good) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges are not good.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges are good.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Kelian has two recipes for preparing dishes. One of them has 20 instructions, and the other one has twice as many instructions as the first one. To find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in both recipes.

The first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

Now, let's add the number of instructions in both recipes: 20 + 40 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes.

First, we need to find the total amount from the brownies. Since each brownie costs $3, we multiply the number of brownies sold (43) by the cost per brownie ($3). This gives us 43 * $3 = $129.

Next, we calculate the total amount from the cheesecakes. Each cheesecake costs $4, so we multiply the number of cheesecakes sold (23) by the cost per cheesecake ($4). This gives us 23 * $4 = $92.

Now, we add the two amounts together: $129 + $92 = $221.

The final answer is: $221"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Shiela's cell phone purchase. She bought five cell phones for $150 each, and a 2% interest will be charged for each unit. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the interest charged and add it to the original price.

The original price of 5 cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750.

The interest charged for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest charged for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total cost of the cell phones is $750 + $15 = $765.

Since Shiela is paying in installments for 3 months, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find the monthly payment.

The monthly payment is $765 / 3 = $255.

The final answer is: $255"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Artie's flower stand problem.

To find out how much Artie will make, we need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar and then multiply the rounded price by the number of pots sold.

The prices of the flowers are: marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot, and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Let's round these prices to the nearest dollar.

Rounded price of marigolds: $2.74 ≈ $3
Rounded price of petunias: $1.87 ≈ $2
Rounded price of begonias: $2.12 ≈ $2

Now, let's calculate the total amount Artie will make from each type of flower:

Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the amounts together to find the total:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"I'm Yumi, and I'd be happy to help you with your question.

So, Luke is building a sandcastle with 4 levels, and each level has half the square footage of the one below it. The top level has a square footage of 16. Let's break it down:

The top level has 16 square feet.
The second level has half of that, which is 16 / 2 = 8 square feet.
The third level has half of 8, which is 8 / 2 = 4 square feet.
The fourth level has half of 4, which is 4 / 2 = 2 square feet.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square feet.

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5 square feet.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, let's find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost per flower for each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the grooming is $100. To find 30% of this amount, we multiply it by 0.3.

30% of $100 = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the final cost.

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

So, the cost of the grooming after the discount is $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much water the girls got. Since they each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, we can calculate this by multiplying 24 by 1/6.

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Next, we know that a boy got 6 liters of water. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy. 
Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

Now, let's subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water. 
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. Then, he bought 21 more from a store, so he now has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

Next, he received 23 stickers for his birthday, bringing his total to 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

After that, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, which means he now has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds. To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times what Grace weighs and then subtract 2 pounds from that result.

4 times what Grace weighs is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

To find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"Let's count the thorns on Dan's rose bushes. He has 3 rose bushes, and each one has 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75
Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's break down the problem. We know the football team played a total of 22 games. We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost. 

Let's denote the number of games they lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We can set up two equations based on this information: W = L + 8 and W + L = 22.

We can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7

Now that we know L, we can find W: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

So, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is: 15"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The alarm rings three times a day, but the number of times it rings each time varies.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 10% increase for 5 years, and then calculate the salary for the next 3 years.

The initial salary is $600. An increase of 10% of $600 is $60. So, the salary after 5 years is $600 + ($60 * 5) = $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

The increase for the next year is 10% of $900, which is $90. So, the salary after 6 years is $900 + $90 = $990. 

For the next year, the increase is 10% of $990, which is $99. So, the salary after 7 years is $990 + $99 = $1089.

For the next year, the increase is 10% of $1089, which is $109.1. So, the salary after 8 years is $1089 + $109.1 = $1198.1.

For the next year, the increase is 10% of $1198.1, which is $119.81. So, the salary after 9 years is $1198.1 + $119.81 = $1317.91.

The final answer is: $1317.91"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we denote the number of copies Harald sold as H, then the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Christina is planning a birthday party and she needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. 

To do this, we can find 1/4 of 16 (the total number of guests) by multiplying 16 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 16 by 4. 

16 / 4 = 4

Now, we subtract 4 from the total number of guests to find the number of guests who will attend.

16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 * $2 = $18

"Let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the dinosaur picnic. 

First, we need to find out how much an adult and a child will eat. An adult will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult, which is 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults. There are 20 adults, so they will eat 20 * 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the children. There are 5 children, and each child will eat 5 pounds of potato salad, so they will eat 5 * 5 = 25 pounds of potato salad.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount eaten by adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find Gerald's original time. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we add 2 seconds to Lee's time. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Next, we need to find out how much Gerald's speed improved. His diet improved his speed by 10%. To find 10% of 40, we multiply 0.1 by 40, which is 4 seconds.

Now, we subtract the improvement from Gerald's original time to find his new time. Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 must be girls.

Total students = 200
Boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Freda's sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total cars originally on the motorway = 30
- 5 cars took an exit, so the remaining cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5 = 25
- Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = cars in the first 15 minutes + cars in the remaining 15 minutes
- Cars in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Mary is an avid gardener who received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate how many potted plants she has in total. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

She received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. 

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we need to calculate 1/4 of 20, which is 5. Then, we add this to the first friend's total: 20 + 5 = 25.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, we can find the third friend's total by adding 10 to this: 60 + 10 = 70.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

"To find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to know the rate at which it covers the city and the total distance of the city.

The fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. We can use this information to find out how many 3-mile sections are in the city. The city is 42 miles across, so we divide 42 by 3 to find the number of sections.

42 / 3 = 14

This means there are 14 sections of 3 miles each in the city. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we can multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 * 10 = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the inner volume of the boxes, we need to calculate the inner dimensions first. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions.

The length of the box is 5 inches, so the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches.

The width of the box is 6 inches, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of the box is 4 inches, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"Let's break down Frankie's TV-watching schedule. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes. That's 2 hours in total.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes x. Since each episode is 30 minutes, or 0.5 hours, the total time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Wednesday is 0.5x hours.

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, or 1.5 hours, of TV. This includes both 1-hour and 30-minute episodes.

On Friday, he watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes.

The total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. The time spent watching 30-minute episodes is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

Now, let's find the average number of roll-ups eaten by adding the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and dividing by 2.

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of rowing in feet per second: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

Now, let's divide the total time by the rate to find the total distance rowed: 64 seconds / 1.25 feet/second = 51.2 feet.

Since we are only interested in sets of 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10: 51.2 feet / 10 = 5.12 sets.

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2: 5.12 sets * 2 liters/set = 10.24 liters.

The final answer is: 10.24"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

There are 4 teachers in the classroom, and each teacher has 2 lessons per day. This means there are a total of 4 * 2 = 8 lessons per day.

Now, let's think about how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in each lesson. The problem states that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson. So, 8 lessons * 3 cleanings per lesson = 24 cleanings.

The final answer is: 24"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Ryan plants 2 flowers a day in his garden. After 15 days, we need to figure out how many flowers he has if 5 of them didn't grow.

To find the total number of flowers, we need to multiply the number of flowers he plants per day by the number of days. That's 2 flowers/day * 15 days = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of these flowers didn't grow, so we need to subtract those from the total. That leaves us with 30 - 5 = 25 flowers.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sasha has leftover lumber that she bought at a certain price, and now she wants to sell it after the prices have gone up by 50%. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each, so the total cost of these boards is 10 * $10 = $100. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each, so the total cost of these boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. So, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each, and the new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards, so the total revenue from these boards is 10 * $15 = $150. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards, so the total revenue from these boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20.

Then, we can find the fraction of the total mixture that is sugar by dividing the number of parts of sugar by the total number of parts: 7/20.

Now, we can multiply this fraction by the total amount of the mixture (120) to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar: (7/20) * 120 = 42.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, and each pair costs $60. To find the total amount he paid, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all 3 children.

First, we find the cost of the shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 = $120.

Then, we multiply this by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

The final answer is: $360"
"Hello, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each at the port on the first day. To find the total number of vehicles on the first day, we multiply the number of containers by the number of vehicles in each container: 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we're told that the total number of vehicles at the port on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles imported on the second day by the number of vehicles in each container: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's salary. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago was 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Four years later, both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased by 40%. To find Adrien's new salary, we need to calculate 40% of his old salary and add it to his old salary. 40% of $40000 is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. So, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of her old salary. 40% of $28000 is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. So, Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

The final answer is: $95200"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week for his drawing. Each pad has 30 sheets of paper. To find out how many sheets of paper he uses in a week, we multiply the number of pads by the number of sheets per pad: 2 * 30 = 60 sheets.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of sheets Miguel uses in a week by 4 to find out how many sheets he uses in a month: 60 * 4 = 240.

"Let's break down the problem. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

To find the total number of fruits Morisette brought, we add the number of apples and oranges: 5 + 8 = 13. To find the total number of fruits Kael brought, we add the number of apples and oranges: 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, let's add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought together: 13 + 14 = 27.

"Let's break down Sadie's sleep schedule for the week.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours. For the next two days, she had to complete some assignments, so she slept 2 hours less each day, which is 6 hours. 

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours

"Let's break down Rosie's running distance into two parts. First, she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find the distance she covers in this time, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find out how much time is left for her to run at 5 miles per hour. We subtract the time she already ran from the total time:

Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Next, we calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour:

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. This means she stamps 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters.
2. After stamping 20 letters, the number of letters needing stamps is 60 - 20 = 40.
3. We are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.
4. Since Jennie stamped 20 letters, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile before she started is 30 - 20 = 10.

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"I'm Yumi, and I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From point 2, we know that Julia had 'x' spoons initially. 
From point 3, we know that after using 3 spoons, Julia had 'x - 3' spoons left.
From point 4, we know that after her husband gave her 5 more spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. 

So, we can set up the equation: x - 3 + 5 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Dillon will spend at the store.

First, we need to determine the cost of each item. We know that each pepper costs $15. 

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, we can calculate its price by multiplying the cost of a pepper by 3. So, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we know that an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon. Therefore, the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item. Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180. He buys 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers is 20 * $15 = $300. Finally, he buys 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges together: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total time spent by doctors. Since each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, and there are 500 patients a day, we multiply the number of patients by the average time per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Now, we need to convert the total minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Next, we calculate the total cost for the doctors. The doctors charge $150 an hour, so we multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Now, let's find the total revenue for the hospital. The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, and there are 500 patients a day. We need to convert the average time per patient from minutes to hours.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour = 2000 * $200/hour = $400000

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $400000 - $30000
Profit = $370000

The final answer is: $370000"

To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to determine 3 times the number of video games Brian has, and then subtract 5 from that result. 

3 times Brian's video games is 3 * 15 = 45.

Now, we subtract 5 from 45 to find out how many video games Bobby has: 45 - 5 = 40.

"Let's break down Rory's delivery order. She orders 2 subs for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each, and 2 cookies for $1.00 each. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee to the total cost of the items. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20:
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
- Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total cost with the delivery fee:

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's break down the information given. We know there are 700 bees in total. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens. 

Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We can express the relationship between the number of worker bees and baby bees as W = 2B. 

We can also express the relationship between the number of baby bees and queens as B = 2Q.

Now, let's use the total number of bees to create an equation. We know that W + B + Q = 700. 

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Since B = 2Q, we have B = 2(100) = 200.

Since W = 2B, we have W = 2(200) = 400.

So, there are 400 worker bees.

"Let's break down the items John bought and calculate the total cost.

First, we need to separate the food items from the non-food items. The food items are milk and eggs, which cost 2 dollars and 3 dollars respectively. So, the total cost of food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

Next, we have the non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. These items cost 3 dollars, 3 dollars, and 4 dollars respectively. So, the total cost of non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount. To do this, we multiply the cost of non-food items by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%): 10 * 0.1 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax to get the total cost: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much profit Kim will make each week.

First, we need to determine the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so we can confidently include them in his calculations. This makes a total of 8 clients.

Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate how many pineapples John can harvest within a year.

First, we need to find out how many pineapples John has in total. Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare and John has 10 hectares, we multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of hectares:
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Now, we need to find out how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees. However, 15 of these bees returned, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 45 - 15 = 30 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.
5. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees. However, 30 of these bees had not returned yet, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 30 (from step 3) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 30 bees return.

The final answer is: 30"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Brittany and her mom went to the museum. The cost of admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom bought 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket. If she received $8 in change, I can help figure out how much money she gave the cashier.

To find the total amount, I need to add the cost of the adult ticket and the child ticket. The adult ticket costs $12 and the child ticket costs $10.

Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, I need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up an equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has ""x"". Then, Charlie has 3x friends.

We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out who wins the race and how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. Steve lives 3 miles away, which is 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet. Tim lives 2 miles away, which is 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute. Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed = 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute. Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed = 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve = 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Shawnda is offering a bike inflation service, and she charges 25 cents per tire. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated. 5 people came by on bicycles, and each bicycle has 2 tires, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 bicycle tires. Then, 3 people came by on tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tricycle tires. Finally, 1 person came by on a unicycle, which has 1 tire.

Now, let's add up the total number of tires: 10 bicycle tires + 9 tricycle tires + 1 unicycle tire = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is 20 * 25 cents = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies inside. We need to find out how much change he receives if he pays with a $10 bill.

First, let's calculate the total number of cookies. Since there are 10 packs and each pack has 6 cookies, we multiply 10 by 6.

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Now, we need to find the total cost of the cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie.

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, we need to find the change he receives. To do this, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill.

$10 - $6 = $4

So, Carl receives $4 in change.

The final answer is: $4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Dave initially ate 14 french fries. The seagull then ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries. So, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.

Next, three pigeons came and ate 3 fries each, which is a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries. Now, the total number of fries eaten is 21 + 9 = 30.

Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. After the pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries were left. The raccoon then ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3)(x - 30). The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).

We can simplify this to (1/3)(x - 30). After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.

We can solve for x by first adding 1 to both sides: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6. Then, multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18. Finally, add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down Kimo's class schedule. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. That's a total of 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week for these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. That's a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours per week for these days.

To find the total hours per week, we add the hours from both sets of days: 9 + 4 = 13 hours per week.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply the total hours per week by the number of weeks: 13 * 16 = 208 hours.

The final answer is: 208"
"Let's calculate the total length of the baked goods Bill bakes every day. 

First, we need to find the total length of each type of baked good. Since each roll is 4 inches long, we multiply the number of rolls by the length of each roll: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.

Next, we calculate the total length of the croissants. Each croissant is 6 inches long, so we multiply the number of croissants by the length of each croissant: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

Now, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long. Then, we multiply the number of baguettes by the length of each baguette: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches.

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together: 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12: 3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape per month and then multiply it by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Blake and Kelly are running on a 100-yard football field. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means he covers a distance of 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Now, let's look at Kelly's runs. She runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner. To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's calculate the total amount Raphael spent on school supplies.

First, we need to find the cost of the pens. Since he bought 4 pens at $1.5 each, the total cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks. Raphael bought 2 notebooks at $4 each, so the total cost of the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $8.

Lastly, we know that the bond paper cost $20.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"Let's break down the situation. Finn initially sees 11 tadpoles in the pond. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out of hiding from under a lily pad, so he now sees a total of 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. However, 2 of these tadpoles then hide under a rock, making them invisible to Finn. To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see now, we need to subtract the 2 that hid: 17 - 2 = 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that a tank of water has a depth of 17 feet on Monday. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water. 

So, the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Now, we need to find the depth of the water on Wednesday, which is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To do this, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. To find the total number of fish he caught, we need to add these numbers together.

Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.

Now, let's look at what Locsin caught. He caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
He caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
He caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

To find the total number of fish caught by Locsin, we add these numbers together: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. We add the total number of fish caught by Anakin to the total number of fish caught by Locsin: 19 + 13 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a bag of marbles that initially costs $20, and the price increases by 20% every two months.

To find the cost after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

After 2 months, the price will be:
Price = Initial price + (Initial price * Increase percentage)
= $20 + ($20 * 0.20)
= $20 + $4
= $24

After 4 months, the price will be:
Price = $24 + ($24 * 0.20)
= $24 + $4.80
= $28.80

After 6 months, the price will be:
Price = $28.80 + ($28.80 * 0.20)
= $28.80 + $5.76
= $34.56

We'll continue this process for the remaining 30 months.

After 8 months, the price will be:
Price = $34.56 + ($34.56 * 0.20)
= $34.56 + $6.912
= $41.472

After 10 months, the price will be:
Price = $41.472 + ($41.472 * 0.20)
= $41.472 + $8.2944
= $49.7664

After 12 months, the price will be:
Price = $49.7664 + ($49.7664 * 0.20)
= $49.7664 + $9.95328

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 5 red cars, each costing $4, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

We also have 3 action figures, and each one costs $5. So, the total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which means it costs 3 * $5 = $15.

"Let's break down the situation. If Jackie decides to do her taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, which means she'll lose $35/hour in missed income. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant:
Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

Since the income lost is greater than the cost of hiring the accountant, Jackie will actually be better off hiring the accountant. To find out how much more money she'll have, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:
Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

€1500 - €1323 = €177

Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits their daughter. To make a Spanish flan, she needs 3 eggs. If Sandra has been tasked to make 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser, let's figure out how many times she has to babysit.

To do this, we need to find out how many eggs Sandra needs in total. Since she needs 3 eggs per Spanish flan and she's making 15, she needs 3 * 15 = 45 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job: 45 / 9 = 5.

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for her school fundraiser."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. The sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write another equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you figure out the total cost of each uniform for the marching band.

To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We have three groups of creatures: spiders, insects, and mutant invertebrates. Each group has a different number of legs.

Spiders have 8 legs each, and there are 80 of them. So, the total number of legs from spiders is 80 * 8 = 640.

Insects have 6 legs each, and there are 90 of them. So, the total number of legs from insects is 90 * 6 = 540.

The mutant invertebrates are a bit unusual, with 10 legs each. There are 3 of them. So, the total number of legs from mutant invertebrates is 3 * 10 = 30.

- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut 60 potatoes.

First, we'll calculate the time it takes to peel one potato. It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel a potato.

Next, we'll calculate the time it takes to cut one potato. Since it takes 5 seconds to cut a potato, we need to convert this to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 5 seconds is equal to 5/60 minutes.

Now, we'll multiply the time it takes to peel one potato by the total number of potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes.

Then, we'll multiply the time it takes to cut one potato by the total number of potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes.

Finally, we'll add the time it takes to peel all the potatoes to the time it takes to cut all the potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons.

First, we need to find out how many gallons of lemonade they sold. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, the total revenue per gallon is $10.

Their total revenue is $25, which is their profit plus the cost of lemons and sugar. Since they sell each gallon for $10, the number of gallons they sold is:

Total revenue = Number of gallons * $10
$25 = Number of gallons * $10

To find the number of gallons, we can divide both sides by $10:

Number of gallons = $25 / $10
Number of gallons = 2.5 gallons

Now that we know the number of gallons, we can find the total cost of lemons. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5, and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. So, the cost of lemons per gallon is $3.

The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:

Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 * 2.5
Total cost of lemons = $7.50

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know there are 240 participants in the race, and 80 of them are Japanese. To find out how many Chinese participants there are, we need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants.

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that 60 of the Chinese participants are boys. To find out how many girls are on the Chinese team, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down Zaid's expenses step by step.

First, Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. His monthly salary is 6000 dollars, so the amount spent on rent is 1/4 * 6000 = 600 dollars.

Next, he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. The amount spent on car fuel is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000 dollars.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel: 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400 dollars.

Zaid then donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. Half of 3400 is 1700, so he donates 1700 dollars to charity.

After the donation, the remaining amount is 3400 - 1700 = 1700 dollars.

Next, Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars for their weekly expenses and household goods. The total amount given to his family is 200 + 700 = 900 dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the amount Zaid has left: 1700 - 900 = 800 dollars.

The final answer is: $800"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. 

Now, we need to find out how many crabs Rani has. It's mentioned that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs, we add the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Lloyd's earnings. 

To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for the first and second weeks together:
$50 + $80 = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total number of students who voted in the class is 80, and the winner got 3/4 of the votes. To find the number of votes the winner got, we multiply 3/4 by 80.

3/4 * 80 = 60 votes

Since the total number of votes is 80, we can find the number of votes the loser got by subtracting the winner's votes from the total.

80 - 60 = 20

So, the loser got 20 votes.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations and 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write the equation 5x = 200.

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40. 
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can write an equation to represent the situation two years ago:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * Jan's age two years ago + 5
Since Jan is 30, two years ago Jan was 28. 
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * 28 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19

Now, we know Mark's age two years ago was 19. To find Mark's current age, we add 2 to this:
Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:
Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down the information given. We have two teams competing in a 4 by 400 meter relay. The well-rounded team has four members, each running their 400 meter leg in exactly 55 seconds. The less well-rounded team's first runner runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the total time for the well-rounded team and the less well-rounded team. The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

Now, let's calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team. Their first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a six-sided die, which means there are 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The favorable outcomes for this are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 total outcomes, making the probability 3/6 or 1/2, which is equivalent to 50%.

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the die is rolled again, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Since these events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. 

50% - 25% = 25%

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Jenna and her mom picked some apples from their apple farm. It's mentioned that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. If her mom got 20 apples, we need to find out how many apples Jenna picked.

To do that, we can simply divide the number of apples her mom picked by 2. So, 20 / 2 = 10 apples. That's how many apples Jenna picked.

Now, to find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store.

We're given that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. Let's first calculate the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits. The hamsters are kept in 10 cages, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

The total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

The total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $100 + $2 = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $102 + $2.04 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of buying and transporting the bags. The cost of buying each bag is $20, and the cost of transporting each bag is $2. So, the total cost for 'x' bags is $20x + $2x = $22x.

Next, we know that the trader made a profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each. This means the total revenue from selling the bags is the total cost plus the profit, which is $22x + $400.

Since the total revenue is also equal to the number of bags sold multiplied by the selling price, we can set up the equation:
$22x + $400 = $30x

Now, let's solve for 'x'. Subtracting $22x from both sides of the equation gives us:
$400 = $8x

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the costs of the outing. The three friends spent $20.25 on tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, which means they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

The cost of the rides is $33 per ride, and they went on 2 different rides, so the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3. So, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is $34."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate how many peaches John collects.

To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he collects per minute by the number of minutes he collects.

John collects 2 peaches per minute. 
He collects for 3 hours. 
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he collects for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of peaches per minute by the total minutes: 
2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we need to first calculate the total pounds of insects they need per week and then divide that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

First, let's calculate the total pounds of insects the flock needs per week. Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week and there are 10 ducks, we multiply the number of ducks by the pounds of insects each duck needs per week.

Total pounds of insects per week = 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Now, let's divide the total pounds of insects per week by 7 to get the pounds of insects per day:
35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. To find the net change in the number of trees per year, we subtract the number of trees he chops down from the number he plants: 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Tom starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's figure out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos on Sunday.

First, the neighbors put 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard on Friday. Then, on Saturday, they took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help Violetta with her crayon purchase.

To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon.

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color.

Total number of crayons she can buy = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons she can buy = 10

Now, to find out how much change she will get, we need to subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has.

Total cost of crayons = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 * $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we can find the cost of a pen by adding the cost of a pencil and an eraser.

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. To do this, we multiply the cost of a pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

"Let's calculate how many pounds of carrots will not be used.

We have 200 pounds of carrots to be distributed to 40 restaurants. Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots.

To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed. We can do this by multiplying the number of pounds each restaurant receives by the total number of restaurants.

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, let's subtract the total pounds distributed from the initial amount to find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used:

Initial amount = 200 pounds
Total pounds distributed = 80 pounds
Pounds not used = Initial amount - Total pounds distributed = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds

"Let's break down Carl's cheese usage for the week. He ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used a total of 7 * 2 = 14 slices for his sandwiches.

For breakfast, Carl had cheese and egg omelets for 3 days. He used one more slice of cheese per omelet than per sandwich, which means he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for the 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for his omelets.

In addition to his sandwiches and omelets, Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that used 8 slices of cheese.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Since Brinley needs a total score of 558 for the semester, we need to find the score she needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Joe's bag of Halloween candy has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and we're given that each chocolate bar weighs 40g.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Now, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

To find out how much more money she needs to earn, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Gary likes to walk around the edge of the local park, which is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he walks at 3 miles/hour, how many hours does he spend walking?

To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Day 1: 100 customers
- Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total by Day 3: 500 customers

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's dive into the problem. We have two pools, and both of them are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool four minutes ago is 2x gallons.

Since 4 minutes have passed, the total amount of water leaked from both pools is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 gallons (since 4 gallons leaked out). The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 4 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water four minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Lori's problem. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt.

The total cost of the items Lori wants to buy is $320.00 for the shoes and $32.00 for the belt. 

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she needs to pay a total of $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (10% of $2000) = $2200.

Now, let's calculate how much she will pay in 12 months. She pays $165 per month, so in 12 months, she will pay a total of $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we need to subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount she needs to pay. So, the remaining balance is $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"Let's count the flowers in the vase. There are 4 roses in the vase. We also know that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. To find the number of dahlias, we add 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack. To find Zack's age, we multiply Harriet's age by 2: 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Next, we need to find Adrian's age. We are told that Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. So, we multiply Harriet's age by 3: 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now that we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63), we need to find their ages in three years. We add 3 to each age: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Naomi scored 68 points. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. To find out how many points Yuri scored, we need to calculate half of Naomi's points first. Half of 68 is 34. 

Now, we add 10 to that to find out Yuri's points: 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we add 17 to Naomi's points: 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points scored by the other three students from the total: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

First, we need to find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. To do this, we subtract 90 from the initial 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Now, we know that Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply the remaining water by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

The amount of rainwater collected is 60 liters. To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the remaining water and the collected rainwater.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

To find the total number of flowers, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. First, let's figure out how many petunias Andy planted. Since he planted 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from 90. That's 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

Now, let's add the number of geraniums and petunias together: 90 + 50 = 140.

So, Andy planted a total of 140 flowers."

Now, let's think about the return trip. Since Andrew is returning from Rochester to New Jersey by car, it will also take him 3 days.

To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to add the number of days it takes to travel to Rochester by bus and the number of days it takes to travel back from Rochester by car. So, the total number of days is 6 (by bus) + 3 (by car) = 9 days.

"Let's calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card from James' collection.

First, we need to find the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type. 

Initial fire type cards = 30
Initial grass type cards = 20
Initial water type cards = 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32
- Total cards = 90 - 8 = 82

After buying 14 grass type cards:
- Grass type cards = 20 + 14 = 34
- Total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

Now, we can calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
= (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.333...%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33.

To find out how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces. Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which is 2 pieces per minute.

Their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Now, let's calculate how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle. We can do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate.

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

So, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. To do this, we'll calculate 30% of the total number of watermelons, which is 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 melons.

Now, we know that 36 melons were ready for harvest after two months. To find the number of melons remaining, we subtract the number of melons ready for harvest from the total number of melons.

120 - 36 = 84 melons.

Next, we need to find out how many melons were ready for harvest after two weeks. We're told that 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so we'll calculate 3/4 of 84.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 melons.

Now, we need to find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks. To do this, we subtract the number of melons ready for harvest from the number of melons remaining.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the cars. Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. So, the total cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the cars. Mark pays 10% tax on the total cost of the cars. To find 10% of $240,000, we multiply $240,000 by 0.1, which gives us $24,000.

Now, we need to add the registration fee to the total cost. Mark pays a registration fee of $1000 for each car, so the total registration fee is 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Finally, we add the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fee to find the total amount Mark pays. $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week
His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Initially, there were 1000 students in the school hall. We know that 30% of the students went out through exit A. To find the number of students who left through exit A, we calculate 30% of 1000.

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left in the hall. We subtract the number of students who left through exit A from the initial number of students.

Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

Next, we're told that 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find the number of students who left through exit B, we calculate 3/5 of 700.

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left in the hall after some went out through exit B. We subtract the number of students who left through exit B from the remaining students.

Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280

Finally, we need to find out how many students went out through exit C. Since the rest of the students went out through exit C, we can say that the number of students who went out through exit C is equal to the remaining students.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike has 5 pen pals initially, but he stops being pen pals with 2 of them. This means he's left with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Each of his remaining pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and since there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Then, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, after Billy took his share, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The equation can be written as:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find out how much Jean paid for the makeup, we need to calculate the total cost first. The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and it takes 6 hours to do each day. Since Jean needs it done 4 times a week for 5 weeks, we can break it down as follows:

Cost per day = $250 * 6 hours = $1500
Cost for 4 days a week = $1500 * 4 = $6000
Cost for 5 weeks = $6000 * 5 = $30,000

However, after the movie is done, Jean gets a 10% discount on the total amount. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%).
Discount = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000
Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid.
Total amount Jean paid = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

- Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.
- Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
- Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies
- Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
- Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
- The difference in calories consumed = 9200 - 3600 = 5600

The final answer is: 5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that the school has 3 classes with 20 students in each class. So, the total number of students in the school is 20 * 3 = 60.

We're also given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

Now, we know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33. 

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 33 = -3.

However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of students. This means that the given information is inconsistent.

But, if we assume that the given information is correct, then the number of boys in the third class is -3."
"Let's figure out how many apps Travis has on his tablet now.

First, we need to subtract the apps he deleted. He had 61 apps and deleted 9, so we do 61 - 9.

61 - 9 = 52

Now, we need to add the apps he downloaded. He downloaded 18 more, so we do 52 + 18.

52 + 18 = 70

Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46.
The total number of cougars killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

The final answer is: 73"
"Let's figure out which floor Bill is on now. To do that, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 
21 * 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. To find out how many cows each stall got, we divide the total number of cows by the number of stalls.

Number of cows added to each stall = 40 / 10
= 4

Now, each stall initially had 20 cows. After Mr. Sylas added the new cows, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 * 8
= 192

The final answer is: 192"
"Let's count the money in Brady's piggy bank. 

First, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill. 
- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together:
$1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section.

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight.

30% of 8000 is 0.3 * 8000 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Nancy's library bill.

To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Adding the flat fee of $2.00, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples.
3. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
5. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
6. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how much flour Carla needs to bake her cookies.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5. 

Since 5.5 dozens is the same as 5 dozen and 6 cookies, we need to calculate the flour needed for 6 cookies. 6 cookies is half of a dozen, so we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we need to add the flour needed for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. 5 dozen cookies need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

So, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's calculate the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup. 

To do this, we need to find two thirds of 9,300. 

Two thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. That's a lot of marbles. To find out how many marbles she has in total, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box.

5 boxes * 50 marbles per box = 250 marbles

But that's not all - she also received 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, we need to add these to the marbles she already had.

250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

So, Maddison now has 270 marbles.

The final answer is: 270"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Next, we need to find the number of trees in Harry's yard. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

So, Harry has 11 trees.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. 

The selling price is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

The difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to find the total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

We then subtract the total fees from the selling price to find the net selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. Since it takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Therefore, it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

To find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we add the time it takes to heat up to 300 degrees, the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, and the time it takes to cook. 

20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

Total balls = 16
Golf balls = Total balls / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8

Now, we're also told that half of the golf balls are blue. To find the number of blue golf balls, we divide the number of golf balls by 2.

Blue golf balls = Golf balls / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4

So, the juggler has 4 blue golf balls.

Next, we know that each bedroom has 2 windows. To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we multiply the total number of bedrooms by the number of windows in each bedroom: 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, let's consider the additional windows in each house. There are 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 2 * 4 = 8.

To find the total number of windows, we add the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows: 12 + 8 = 20.

"Let's break down the information given. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete. The collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help Sean with his memorization task.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, let's break it down step by step.

The solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of these lines are Sean's, he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and 10 minutes to dig a large hole. We need to find out how many hours it will take him to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig the small holes. Since it takes 3 minutes per hole and there are 30 holes, the total time for small holes is 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig the large holes. Since it takes 10 minutes per hole and there are 15 holes, the total time for large holes is 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes together: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

Mico and Marco want to get to know each other, and they realized that the sum of their ages is 20. To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to consider their current ages and add 10 to each of them.

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as m. We know that M + m = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: (M + m) + 20. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute this value into the expression to get 20 + 20 = 40.

However, I made a slight mistake in my calculation. Let's correct that. The correct sum of their ages in 10 years is actually 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of spots on the cobras. Since there are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Next, we need to find the total number of spots on the mambas. Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

To find the total number of spots on both the cobras and the mambas, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

To find the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for, we need to calculate the total number of team members, coaches, and guests. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we need to find the total length of the space between the gemstones. 

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

Now, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: 25 - 8 = 17 inches. However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: 1.75 / (1/4) = 1.75 / 0.25 = 7.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. So, Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to find the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so we multiply the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone:

80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks, which is 2000 pounds per truck:

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two cars, one in the fast lane and one in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, while the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

We know that the car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles. To find the time it took for the car in the fast lane to cover this distance, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

Plugging in the values, we get: time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Now, we need to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance. Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles per hour, we can use the same formula: time = distance / speed.

Substituting the values, we get: time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, so the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let x be the total number of medals given out. Then, 10x = 39 (since Ali and Izzy have 39 medals together).

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

The total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. There are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get: 16 / 8 = 2.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Susan's earnings for the online task.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how much she earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her earnings per 10 minutes.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, let's convert the time to minutes. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the points of the three friends after the fourth round.

Mike initially has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 21 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know the oldest son is 8 years old and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest. To find the youngest son's age, we divide the oldest son's age by 2: 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now, we know both sons' ages. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. In total, they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, we need to find out how many are left unwashed. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down Darren's workout routine for the two days.

On the first day, Darren does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

For the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He does ten fewer squats, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats. He doubles the number of dumbbell presses, which is 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Now, let's calculate the total count of activities for each day. 
- Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170
- Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

To find the total count of activities in two days, we add the totals for each day: 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much rice is consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

The final answer is: 3"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Sam's bread sales for the week. He had a target of selling 120 crates of bread. Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, we'll focus on the other days.

Over the weekend, Sam sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and on Thursday 18 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

Now, let's calculate how many crates Sam was off from his target.

Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carmen starts with a bid of $200, and each subsequent bid increases by $50. There are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them. This means there are 3 bids from the other people, and 3 bids from Carmen, making a total of 6 bids.

To find the total cost of the desk, we need to calculate the sum of these 6 bids. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 200, d = 50, and n = 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

The final answer is: $1950"
"Let's break down John's driving expenses. He commutes 30 miles to work and back each day, which is a total of 60 miles per day. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, his weekly commute is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. 

Over the course of 50 weeks in a year, John's total commute is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year. 

John is charged $2 per mile, so his total driving cost is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

In addition to the driving cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, his total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

To find the total cost, we add the driving cost and the bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's figure out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes, and on Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 

To find the combined minutes, we add the minutes from both days: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Now, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. To find this, we multiply the combined minutes by 2: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes.

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're making a 32-page tabloid, and we want to know how many pieces of paper we need.

When we fold a piece of paper, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we can consider the following arrangement:

- The first page (page 1) is on the left back.
- The second page (page 2) is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back.
- The 31st page is on the right front.

This pattern continues until we reach the middle of the paper, where the 16th page is on the left back and the 15th page is on the left front. 

After the middle, the pattern reverses, with the 17th page on the right back and the 16th page on right front.

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, we need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages (left and right sides) and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages (left and right sides).

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 (for the first 16 pages) + 2 (for the last 16 pages) = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's talk about Annika's trip to the town fair. She brought $50 with her. To find out how much she has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at $20, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45.

To find the total amount of money she earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year. We know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We also know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first year and the current year from the total number of books sold: 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = $1300.

The final answer is: $1300"
"Let's break down Watson's earnings for April. He works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. To find his total hours worked in a week, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days worked per week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Additionally, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. So, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20.

20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4

So, John lost to 4 people.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we multiply 60 by 2/3.

60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. We subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves produced.

60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we multiply the remaining loaves by 1/2.

20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds by 4, and then divide the result by 4.

"Let's calculate the savings on the items.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a serum that makes the drinker grow extra limbs at specific intervals. 

First, we need to figure out how many extra arms the person will grow. Since they grow an extra arm every 3 days, we divide the total number of days (15) by 3 to find out how many times this happens. 15 / 3 = 5, so they'll grow 5 extra arms.

Next, we need to calculate the number of extra legs. The person grows an extra leg every 5 days, so we divide the total number of days (15) by 5. 15 / 5 = 3, which means they'll grow 3 extra legs.

Now, we just need to add the number of extra arms and legs together to find the total number of new limbs. 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down Theo's expenses for his business trip to South Africa.

First, he buys 6 business suits at $100 each, which costs 6 * $100 = $600. Then, he buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, which costs 3 * $50 = $150. 

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950. This is the total amount he has spent so far.

To find out how much he has left, we subtract the total cost from his initial budget: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost so far) = $4050.

However, Theo wants to save $2000 for this trip. So, we subtract the amount he wants to save from the remaining budget: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

Since he wants to save $2000, he has $2050 - $2000 = $50 left over, which he can spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many people eat 3 eggs each day and how many people eat 2 eggs each day. Since there are 5 people in the family, 3 people eat 3 eggs each day, and the rest (5 - 3 = 2) eat 2 eggs each day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the people who eat 3 eggs each day: 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the people who eat 2 eggs each day: 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs consumed by both groups: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to multiply the total number of eggs consumed in a day by 7 to find the total number of eggs consumed in a week: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. To find Jane's age, we subtract 3 from Quinn's age: 30 - 3 = 27.

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we add 5 to Jane's age: 27 + 5 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Noah's current age. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old. Since then, Noah has aged 6 years, so his current age is 20 + 6 = 26 years old.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old at that time, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. This means the current population is twice the population six years ago, which is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total number of players on the football team is 105. 

We are given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. Then, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

We are also given that there are half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. So, the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 30

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Martha's Christmas party planning.

Let's break it down step by step. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people. 

First, we need to find the total number of people invited. For the 2 families with 6 people, that's 2 * 6 = 12 people. For the 3 families with 4 people, that's 3 * 4 = 12 people. So, the total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24 people.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. That leaves us with 24 - 8 = 16 people.

But, 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. That's 8 / 4 = 2 people. So, we need to subtract these 2 people from the 16 people who were still planning to come.

Now, let's subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited. That's 16 - 2 = 14 people.

The final answer is: 14"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. To find the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna, we simply add the two numbers together: 20 + 50 = 70.

Next, Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find 2/5 of 20, we multiply 20 by 2 and then divide by 5: (2 * 20) / 5 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. We add the marbles he bought from Johanna to the marbles his father gave him: 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the cost to fill the pool.

To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. We're also told that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

First, let's calculate the number of girls. Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, we multiply the number of boys by 3:
Girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we need to find the number of nongendered children. We're told that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so we multiply the number of boys by 1/10:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children in the classroom:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find out how many people left, we need to calculate 1/4 of 40, which is 40 * 1/4 = 10.

Since 10 people left, the number of people remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were 25 men initially, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 (because 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men).

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the book costs $4. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, we can calculate its cost by dividing the cost of the book by 2. 

The cost of the magazine is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we're told that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. To find the cost of the pen, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine.

The cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider the weakening caused by both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening caused by the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and we want to cool it down by 65 degrees. Since the temperature difference is 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Now, let's find out how much the coffee is weakened by these ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the weakening caused by the cream. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

To find the total weakening, we add the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that 5 people came in with old records and left with 7 new records. Since they trade 2 old records for 1 new record, we need to find out how many old records they brought in.

Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the number of old records traded is twice the number of new records. 

Number of new records = 7
Number of old records traded = 2 * Number of new records
Number of old records traded = 2 * 7
Number of old records traded = 14

Since there are 5 people, and they all brought in the same number of old records, we can divide the total number of old records traded by 5 to find out how many old records each person brought in.

Number of old records per person = Number of old records traded / Number of people
Number of old records per person = 14 / 5
Number of old records per person = 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records.

Total number of old records = Number of old records per person * Number of people
Total number of old records = 2.8 * 5
Total number of old records = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers:
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
= 2/5 * 100
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is:
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers:
Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Now, let's find the salary of senior programmers:
Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:
Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's find the total amount paid to all programmers:
Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. On his way to school, he eats 2, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes 14 out to his friends, which brings his total down to 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

After school, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, Oscar eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, bringing his total down to 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to charge 40%, we multiply 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

"Let's break down the customer's shopping trip. They spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which means they earned $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they earned 4 rewards, which is $4 off their next purchase.

On their current shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, which is $4 off the price. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much the customer paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent: $43 - $12 = $31.

"Let's break down the information given for the two job options.

For Job A, we know the hourly wage is $15 and the total hours worked per year is 2000. To find the total income, we multiply the hourly wage by the total hours worked: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year.

Next, we need to calculate the income tax for Job A. Since the state has a 20% total tax rate, we multiply the total income by the tax rate: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. 

Now, we subtract the income tax from the total income to find the net income for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, we know the total income is $42,000. However, there's a property tax of $6,000 and a 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax. First, we subtract the property tax from the total income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. This is the net income before tax.

Next, we calculate the income tax for Job B by multiplying the net income before tax by the tax rate: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.

Finally, we subtract the income tax from the net income before tax to find the net income for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

"Let's break down the two offers from Furniture United and Cozy Homes to find the cost difference.

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment. The total amount paid in installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment. The total amount paid in installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each. The stock price increases by 50% in the first year, which means the price of each share becomes $8 + (50% of $8) = $8 + $4 = $12.

Now, in the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the decrease, we multiply the current price by 25% or 0.25. So, the decrease is $12 * 0.25 = $3. 

Now, we subtract the decrease from the current price to get the new price: $12 - $3 = $9.

Since Maria has 8 shares, we multiply the new price by the number of shares to find the total value: 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of all Maria's shares is $72."

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a class of 200 students that's split into 3 groups. Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two.

Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Then, the number of students in the smallest group would be x - 10.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x: 
70 - 10 = 60

So, the smallest group has 60 students.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, and they are all either chickens or cows. He also has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's call the number of cows ""C"" and the number of chickens ""H"". Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, we can say that H = 2C.

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write an equation: H + C = 60. We can substitute H with 2C in this equation, resulting in 2C + C = 60. This simplifies to 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Since H = 2C, we can find the value of H by multiplying C by 2, resulting in H = 40.

Now, let's count the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"Josh decides to take up juggling to perform at the school talent show a month in the future. He starts off practicing juggling 3 balls, and slowly gets better adding 1 ball to his juggling act each week. After the end of the fourth week, the talent show begins, but when Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops three of his balls. 2 of them are caught by people in the crowd as they roll off the stage, but one gets lost completely since the auditorium is dark.

To find out how many balls Josh has left, we need to calculate how many balls he had initially and then subtract the ones he lost. Josh had 3 balls initially and added 1 ball each week for 4 weeks, so he had 3 + 4 = 7 balls. When he dropped 3 balls, 2 were caught, so 1 ball was lost.

So, Josh starts juggling with 7 balls and loses 1, leaving him with 7 - 1 = 6 balls.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that a pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, a green toad, and that the yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog. We also know that the red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can determine the weights of the other animals:

- The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of the animals and the container:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds

The final answer is: 260"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits that her child no longer needed. At her baby shower, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits. Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits. Let's calculate the total number of outfits she has for her baby.

First, we need to find out how many outfits she received at the baby shower. Since she got twice the amount of new outfits, we multiply the initial 24 outfits by 2. That's 24 * 2 = 48 outfits.

Now, let's add up all the outfits: 24 (from her friend) + 48 (from the baby shower) + 15 (from her mom) = 87 outfits.

The final answer is: 87"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run. 

The original distance Tyson runs is 5000 meters. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. 

1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters. 

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's talk about the prices of these juice boxes. Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, which means it costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. 

Now, let's look at Juice Box C. It's 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we need to subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C. That's 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have.

First, we need to find the total number of legs for the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

Next, we calculate the total number of legs for the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, let's add the number of legs from both types of tables: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The final answer is: 310"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jenny buys a bag of cookies that contains 36 cookies. Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, which is a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. 

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies used by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to subtract the total number of cookies used by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in the bag. 

36 - 27 = 9

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The discount is 40% of $30.

40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt.

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to get the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase in the amount the factory makes per day, we need to compare the current daily earnings to the previous daily earnings.

The factory used to sell 10 tractors a day at $100 per tractor, so their previous daily earnings were 10 * $100 = $1000.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day at $220 per silo, so their current daily earnings are 5 * $220 = $1100.

To find the difference in earnings, we subtract the previous earnings from the current earnings: $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the previous earnings and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you calculate how much Madeline spends on her dog per year.

To find out the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food, treats, and medicine per month, and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the cost of food per month. Food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so the food cost per month is $25 * 4 = $100.

Next, we add the cost of treats and medicine to the food cost. Treats cost $20 per month, and medicine costs $100 per month. So, the total cost per month is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

Now, let's multiply the total cost per month by 12 to get the total cost per year: $220 * 12 = $2640.

The final answer is: $2640"
"Let's break down Peyton's after-work activities for the week.

On Monday, Peyton has a one-hour yoga class. On Tuesday, she has a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga, which is 3 hours. On Wednesday, she attends a half-hour cheese-tasting event. On Thursday, she goes on a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class, which is 1.5 hours. Finally, on Friday, she has two hours of errands.

To find the total time, we need to add up the time for all activities. 

1 hour (yoga) + 3 hours (cooking) + 0.5 hours (cheese-tasting) + 1.5 hours (museum tour) + 2 hours (errands) = 7.5 hours

The final answer is: 7.5"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, April is donating plant pots to a local school for their new garden. They need 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. To find out how many plant pots April needs in total, we need to calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since they need twice as many for the roses as for the daisies, that's 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots.

Now, let's add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses: 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots.

April already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Andrea started with $36. She spent $11 on a sweater, so she had $36 - $11 = $25 left. Then, she gave her brother $4, leaving her with $25 - $4 = $21.

To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she had after spending and giving her brother money from the initial amount.

Initial amount: $36
Amount after saving: $21

Amount saved = Initial amount - Amount after saving
Amount saved = $36 - $21
Amount saved = $15

"Let's break down John's activities. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. He also watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We know that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. If 30% of the total time is 6 hours, we can find the total time by dividing 6 by 0.30. That gives us 20 hours.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying 0.40 by the total time: 0.40 * 20 = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Annabelle's situation. She's saving for a phone that costs $400 and already has $80 in her savings. She earns $10 per hour at her first job and works for 20 hours, which gives her $200. At her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work, adding up to $75.

To find out how much more she needs, we need to add her earnings from both jobs and subtract that from the cost of the phone. Her total earnings are $200 + $75 = $275. Now, let's subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $275 = $125.

Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We have three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Now, let's find the combined height of the two shorter trees. We add their heights together: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. So, we multiply the combined height by 2: 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much Dean spent on toy cars. Since each toy car costs $2 and he bought 6 of them, the total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, we need to find out how much Dean spent on teddy bears. Since each teddy bear costs $1 and he bought 5 of them, the total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears to find the total amount Dean spent: $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially received $28 from his mother, and then he got an extra $10. So, the total amount of money he has now is $28 + $10 = $38.

Finally, let's subtract the amount Dean spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Morgan's dad has a budget of $90 for her birthday party. She wants to spend it on mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities. A round of mini-golf costs $5, and Morgan and her friends will play one round. The cost of arcade tokens is $5. The cost of go-karts is $10 per ride, and Morgan and her friends will ride twice. 

The total cost of mini-golf is $5. The total cost of arcade tokens is $5. The total cost of go-karts is 2 rides * $10 = $20. 

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. 

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $35 = 1.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.57 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $55 - $5 = $50. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$50 / $35 = 1.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.43 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $50 - $20 = $30. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$30 / $35 = 0.86

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.86 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the mini-golf in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $30 - $5 = $25. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$25 / $35 = 0.71

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.71 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $25 - $5 = $20.

0.57 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $20 - $5 = $15. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$15 / $35 = 0.43

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$10 / $35 = 0.29

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.29 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $10 - $5 = $5. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$5 / $35 = 0.14

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.14 ≈ 0

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day from her parents. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each every day and saves the change in her piggy bank. 

First, we need to convert the cost of lollipops from cents to dollars. 
25 cents = $0.25
So, 4 lollipops cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day.
Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days.
Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Billy starts with $10 and buys candy at $1.5 per pound. If he buys x pounds of candy, the total cost of the candy is 1.5x. 

The amount of money Billy has left after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x. He then takes half of this amount and spends it on gumballs that cost $0.05 each. Since he buys 40 gumballs, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since he takes half of his change, the amount he spends on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2. We know that the amount he spends on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's solve the problem together. We know that Carver is 45 years old, and his age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can represent his son's age as 'x'. 

The relationship between Carver's age and his son's age can be expressed as:
Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:
45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':
50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the distance from the third city to the first city. To do this, we add the distances from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city, then subtract 50 miles.

Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Combined distance: 75 + 100 = 175 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance traveled in one trip. 
Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 125 miles
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is:
Total distance in one trip: 300 miles
Total trips in a day: 3
Total distance in a day: 300 * 3 = 900 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we need to divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day.
Total distance between services: 18,000 miles
Total distance in a day: 900 miles
Number of days between services: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2. 
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 
Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"Let's break down John's trip into two parts: driving to his friend's house and driving back home.

To find the time taken to drive to his friend's house, we need to calculate the distance first. The original distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance to his friend's house is 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles.

Time taken to drive to his friend's house = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the time taken to drive back home. The distance to drive back home is 240 miles, and John drives at a speed of 80 mph. 

Time taken to drive back home = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to friend's house + Time taken to drive back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. 

A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
S = 4 * 3 - 5
S = 12 - 5
S = 7

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
V = 3 * S
V = 3 * 7
V = 21

If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we need to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. 
Let's denote the number of people kicked out for other reasons as O. 
The total number of people kicked out is the sum of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons.

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's start with the picture frames. Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20. Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to consider the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost, which is 20% of $20, or $4 per frame. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching together. $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will also receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Lastly, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 of 44, or 11 seniors. These officers will receive cords that cost $12 each. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

To find the total cost of all the gifts, we add the cost of the picture frames and etching, the cost of the pins, and the cost of the cords together. $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double that number of shoes, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:
50 * 2 = 100

One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

So, the total number of pupils who like blue and green is 20 (blue) + 5 (green) = 25 pupils.

To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils: 40 - 25 = 15.

Jenny has a pizza with 12 slices. She decides to share it with Bill and Mark. She gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. Then, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices. Now, let's calculate how many slices are left. Jenny also ate 2 slices for herself.

To find the total number of slices she gave away and ate, we add 7 (slices given away) and 2 (slices eaten), which equals 9 slices.

Now, let's subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices: 12 - 9 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's calculate how many days Mark needs to save to buy a bike.

Mark has $50 in his bank account and earns $10 per day at his work. The bike he wants costs $300. To find out how many days he needs to save, we need to divide the cost of the bike by the amount he earns per day.

Cost of the bike: $300
Amount earned per day: $10

Number of days = Cost of the bike / Amount earned per day
= $300 / $10
= 30

The final answer is: 30"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Nancy's bug count.

To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders: 90
Number of millipedes: 1/3rd of 90 = 90 / 3 = 30
Number of stink bugs: 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Now, let's add them all up: 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

The final answer is: 168"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Erica is 30 years old.
2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35.
3. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12.

"Let's calculate the total calories John consumed from the milk. 

First, we need to find the total ounces of milk he drank. Since John drank 2 glasses of milk and each glass is 8 ounces, we multiply 2 by 8 to get the total ounces. 

2 * 8 = 16 ounces

Now, we know that milk has 3 calories per ounce. To find the total calories consumed by John, we multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce.

16 * 3 = 48 calories

So, John consumed 48 calories from the milk."
"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate his daily earnings, then multiply it by the number of days he works in a year.

First, let's find out how many days he works in a year. He works 4 weeks every month, and there are 12 months in a year. So, the total number of weeks he works in a year is 4 * 12 = 48 weeks.
Since he works 6 days every week, the total number of days he works in a year is 48 * 6 = 288 days.

Now, let's find out his daily earnings. He gets paid $50 every day.

So, his total earnings in a year would be his daily earnings multiplied by the number of days he works in a year.
Total earnings = $50 * 288
Total earnings = $14400

The final answer is: $14400"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, and he needs to buy flour and milk. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.

To figure out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we divide the total amount of flour required by the amount of flour in each bag. The total flour required is 4 * 3 cups, which equals 12 cups. Since each bag contains 2 cups of flour, Mark needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Next, we calculate the number of bottles of milk Mark needs. The total milk required is 4 * 1 cup, which equals 4 cups. Since each bottle contains 2 cups of milk, Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk. This is simply 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to find the energy used per day. The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since Mel uses it for 8 hours a day, the original energy used per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new energy used per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh.

The energy saved per day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

The final answer is: 135"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the average number of stripes on the zebras.

We have two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There's one zebra with 36 stripes.
And another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
We have a total of 4 zebras.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"Let's calculate how much money Tyson will spend on the meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches.

First, we need to figure out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people in total, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Now, we know that each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So, Tyson needs 5 pounds of each.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese.

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis. So, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, let's add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought: 
Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 20
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200."
"Let's break down Elliott's steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

The final answer is: 2000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and it averages 200 words per page, we can calculate the total number of words in the book.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Now, we can find the time it takes to read the book by dividing the total number of words by Toby's reading rate of 300 words per minute.

Time to read the book = Total words / reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so we need to add this to the time it takes to read the book to find out the total time Toby will be at the airport.

Total time at the airport = Time to read the book + Time to get to the airport = 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we can find out how many minutes early he will be by subtracting the time he arrives from the time he has to be there.

Time early = Time to be at the airport - Total time at the airport = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Sally's shopping trip.

Let's break down the items she bought. The taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound of taffy is half off, so it costs $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Sally also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

The total cost of the items Sally bought is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

He gets a 20% discount on them, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240. 

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

He also bought a finale firework for $150.

So, the total amount spent is $960 (fireworks) + $150 (finale firework) = $1110.

"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply 2 by 30:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make. Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Marcy makes 50000 candles, and 5% of the candles that are more dangerous smell like wet dog. To find the number of candles that are more dangerous, we need to find 1% of 50000, since 99% of the candles are not more dangerous. 

1% of 50000 is 0.01 * 50000 = 500. Now, we need to find 5% of the 500 candles that are more dangerous. This is 0.05 * 500 = 25.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25."

"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's call the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a herd consisting of camels and dromedaries. We know that there are 180 heads and 304 bumps in total.

First, let's consider the number of heads. Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is equal to the sum of the number of camels and the number of dromedaries. We can write this as an equation:

C + D = 180

Now, let's consider the number of bumps. Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each. So, the total number of bumps is equal to twice the number of camels plus the number of dromedaries. We can write this as another equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve this system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

"Let's break down Tom's trip into manageable parts. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

Next, we need to find 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is (30/100) * 800 km = 240 km. This means Tom traveled 240 km in the next 2 days.

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and his comb fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below. To find the elevation where the comb landed, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation.

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats on the rock: 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, we need to find out how many cats ran after the mouse. We know that 3/5 of the remaining cats ran, so we multiply 3/5 by the number of remaining cats: (3/5) * 30 = 18.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran from the number of remaining cats to find the number of cats left on the rock: 30 - 18 = 12.

"Let's break down the cost of the streaming service for Bill. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.

The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of the jogger jeans. We know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Now, substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combine like terms: 3T - 6 = 18.

Add 6 to both sides: 3T = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Lillian's bird feeder problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Lillian made 3 bird feeders, and each of these attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Since the store-bought ones attract 20 birds, the homemade ones attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

She bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these attracts 20 birds. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Kenny is trying to buy a ticket to an amusement park that costs $100. He has a collection of Pokémon cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash. To find out how many cards he started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold.

Since Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he needs to make $50 from selling the cards. We can calculate the number of cards he sold by dividing the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5 = 33.33 (round down to 33 since you can't sell a fraction of a card)

However, Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.33

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to determine how many hotdogs were prepared. The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests were prepared for to have two hotdogs. This means 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests. 

However, the caterer prepared enough for the other half of the guests (also 18) to have one hotdog each. So, 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests. 

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were needed. 

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. This means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Charlotte's shopping problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. Charlotte wants a set of pot and pans for $120.00, a set of mixing bowls for $20.00, and 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each. 

To find the total cost of the utensils, we multiply the cost of one utensil by the number of utensils: 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $120.00 (pot and pans) + $20.00 (mixing bowls) + $25.00 (utensils) = $165.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The store is offering a 20% discount on the total cost. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: $165.00 x 0.20 = $33.00.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte needs to pay: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. One-fifth of 150 is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much gas is in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can find the amount in one container by dividing 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3 gallons

Now, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. To find out how many pints are in 3 gallons, we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 pints

However, Josey only needed 1/4 of a container. To find 1/4 of 3 gallons, we multiply 3 by 0.25 (since 1/4 is the same as 0.25).

3 * 0.25 = 0.75 gallons

Now, we convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 0.75 by 8.

0.75 * 8 = 6 pints

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money George spent on chips. Since he bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, the total cost of the chips is 3 * 40 cents = $1.20.

Next, we need to find out how much money George spent on candy bars. Since he spent a total of $5 and had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money. This means he spent $5 - $0.01 = $4.99.

Now, we can find the amount of money George spent on candy bars by subtracting the cost of the chips from the total amount he spent: $4.99 - $1.20 = $3.79.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find the number of candy bars George bought by dividing the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: $3.79 / 0.75 = 5.0533.

Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's solve this problem together. Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. To find out how many lollipops he shared with his friends, we need to subtract the lollipops he kept from the total.

25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept) = 20 lollipops shared

Now, we need to divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends, which is 4.

20 lollipops / 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rory makes a cake that weighs 20 ounces and cuts it into 8 equal pieces. Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find out how much cake is left.

First, we need to find the weight of each piece. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Now, we know that Rory and her mom each have a piece, so we need to find the total weight of the cake they ate. Since they each had one piece, the total weight eaten is equal to the weight of two pieces.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's figure out how many oranges everyone will get. Sitti and Juris have a total of 34 and 22 oranges, respectively. To find the total number of oranges, we add them together: 34 + 22 = 56.

They want to share these oranges with their 6 other friends, making a total of 8 people. To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 ÷ 8 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Antoine's French onion soup recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount. So, he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00. Therefore, the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

To find the total cost of the ingredients, we add the cost of onions and beef stock: $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we can find the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's. So, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time difference between their arrival times.

If Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, and she needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.

So, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final answer is: 21"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's solve this problem together. We're given that the area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet, and the length of his room is 3 yards. We need to find the perimeter of the room in feet.

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can multiply 3 yards by 3 to get the length in feet:
3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:
width = 360 / 9
width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how many beads each sister has and then compare the difference.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the situation. Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's consider the effect of the open window. The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. For every 10 minutes the window is open, the house cools down by 2 degrees. So, for 30 minutes, it cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

To find the final temperature, we add the initial temperature to the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the open window. 

40 (initial temperature) + 15 (temperature increase) - 6 (temperature decrease) = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"Let's break down the information given. Jon's times for the swim, bike, and run are 40 minutes, 80 minutes, and 50 minutes, respectively. 

To find James' total time, we need to consider the changes in his times compared to Jon's. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so his swim time is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes. He takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find James' total time. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes. 

To find James' run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"Let's break down the information given. Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, we can find its length by adding 5 minutes to Movie C's length: 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Now, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find Movie A's length, we can divide Movie B's length by 4: 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Rozanne's eggnog problem.

To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she has. She uses 4 dozen eggs from cases and 2 loose eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses Rozanne can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the total number of trays Rozanne can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"Let's break down the situation. Joey starts with 214 points and scores 26 points. To find out how many points he has after his turn, we need to add those two numbers together.

Joey's initial points: 214
Points scored by Joey: 26
Joey's total points after his turn: 214 + 26 = 240

Now, let's look at Marcy's situation. She starts with 225 points and scores 10 points. To find out how many points she has after her turn, we need to add those two numbers together.

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10
Marcy's total points after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235

To determine by how many points Joey is winning, we need to find the difference between his total points and Marcy's total points.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the salesman's profit.

First, we need to calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, we need to calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
$340 + $775 = $1115

Now, we need to find the profit. To do this, we subtract the initial cost of the case of sneakers from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Beatrice bought ten packets of crayons for her Art class. Six of the packets had eight pieces of colors each, and the other four packets had sixteen pieces of colors each. Let's calculate the total number of crayons she bought.

First, we need to find the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each. That's 6 multiplied by 8, which equals 48.

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each. That's 4 multiplied by 16, which equals 64.

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given:

You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?

Let's analyze the situation: If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If you buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total cost of filling 20 helium balloons was $900. To find the cost of filling one balloon, we need to divide the total cost by the number of balloons: 900 / 20 = 45.

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. Multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11050.

The final answer is: 11050"

Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. To find the value of the sapphires she has left, we subtract the number of sapphires she traded from the initial number: 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Now, let's find the value of the rubies she received. Since she traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, we can assume the value of the rubies is proportional to the value of the sapphires. The value of the rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

To find the total value of her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the cost of potting soil for Bob's vegetable garden.

To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. The volume of one bed is length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know there are 15 red cards. To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% more than 15. 

60% of 15 is 0.6 * 15 = 9. So, the number of green cards is 15 + 9 = 24.

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards, which is 15 + 24 = 39.

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78.

Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest. Then, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined the group.

Now, we add the new fairies to the initial number of fairies: 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

After that, 30 fairies flew away. To find the number of fairies remaining, we subtract 30 from 75: 75 - 30 = 45.

So, there are 45 fairies remaining.

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon has 4 puppies with spots.

Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed he's buying.

First, let's calculate the weight of each type of feed. 

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."

Aluminum cans are worth two cents each, so three cans are worth 3 * 2 = 6 cents. 
Plastic bottles are worth three cents each, so five bottles are worth 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

To find her weekly earnings, we add the value of the cans and bottles: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

Since there are four weeks in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

First, we need to find out how much Becky paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents. Since there's a $1 discount, we subtract 100 cents from the total cost: 900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 800 cents / 100 = $8.

Next, we need to find out how much Kelly paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents. Since there's a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of 1000 cents. To do this, we multiply 1000 cents by 0.1: 0.1 * 1000 cents = 100 cents. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: 1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 900 cents / 100 = $9.

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. We do this by subtracting Becky's total cost from Kelly's total cost: $9 - $8 = $1.

To figure out how many pans of cupcakes she should bake, let's first calculate how many cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has.

Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, she can decorate 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide 48 by 12 to get the number of pans.

48 / 12 = 4

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes."

Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. 
Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's solve the problem together. Matt's dad has a deal with him: for every carrot stick Matt eats, he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, how many carrot sticks does he have to eat?

Let's call the number of carrot sticks Matt eats 'x'. According to the deal, the number of cookies he gets is (1/2)x + 2. Since Matt wants to eat five cookies, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a 10-foot shark with 2 remoras attached to it, and each remora is 6 inches long. To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their length from inches to feet.

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing it by 12. 

6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

Now, we have 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we'll divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

So, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's solve this problem together. We're given that three-fourths of the students at a certain grade level have a desktop computer at home, and 20 students do not have a desktop computer. Since one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer, we can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to isolate x:
x = 20 * 4
x = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many days Jason has to walk in total, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Sarah went to buy books from the store and spent $300 on them. Each book costs $15, and she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought in total.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 9 kids in Gina's class are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to consider the total number of kids in the class and subtract the number of kids with allergies.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts, then subtract the number allergic to both to avoid double-counting:
9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, the company decided to take its employees on a tour to explore an ancient site. They divided the employees into 3 groups of 200 each. Each group was assigned 7 tour guides. To find the total number of people going on this tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and add the number of tour guides.

First, let's find the total number of employees. Since there are 3 groups of 200 employees, we multiply 3 by 200 to get the total number of employees: 3 * 200 = 600.

Next, we need to find the total number of tour guides. Each group has 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups, so we multiply 3 by 7 to get the total number of tour guides: 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, we add the total number of employees and tour guides to get the total number of people going on the tour: 600 (employees) + 21 (tour guides) = 621.

"Let's break down the cost of Tom's anniversary getaway.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since there are two tickets, each costing $5000, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Next, we need to find the cost of the hotel. The normal price is $1500 per day, but it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend. To find the new price, we multiply the normal price by 1.2, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they're staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, let's add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip. $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

"Let's break down the information given. Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, which means Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper also has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes together: 2 + 9 = 11.

Three-quarters of 48 grains is (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains.

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains. To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we simply add the weights of the two pennies together.

The combined weight of the two pennies is 36 + 48 = 84 grains.

60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Now, we need to find out how much money he gave up. He gave up $10 for each orange he ate, so we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down James' running schedule. He runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. To find out how many miles he runs in a week, we multiply the miles he runs per day by the number of days he runs per week.

Miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
= 60 miles/week

Now, we know James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the total hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles run in a week by his speed.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Uncle Ben has four horses, and each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal. Since he feeds his horses twice a day, each horse eats 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

To find the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day, we multiply the amount each horse eats by the number of horses: 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed for five days. We multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed by the weight of one bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs: 200 / 50 = 4.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 saved up. To find out how many days it will take for him to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first.

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount.

Daily savings = $2
Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount.

First, let's find out how many eggs can fit on the 2 trays. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs, we multiply the number of eggs per tray by the number of trays:
24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Now, we subtract the number of eggs that can fit on the trays from the total number of eggs Jaime has:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Sally bought one small pizza that costs $8 and one family-size pizza that costs 3 times as much as the small pizza. To find the total amount she spent, I'll calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first.

The cost of the family-size pizza is 3 times the cost of the small pizza, which is $8. So, the family-size pizza costs $8 * 3 = $24.

Now, I'll add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Heather buys razors that come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. They are on sale for buy one get one free, and she also has a $2.00 coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors, which is $4.00. She also gets a $2.00 discount with her coupon.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, let's find the cost of each individual razor. There are 4 razors in a pack, and Heather buys 2 packs, so she has a total of 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 9 cheerleaders who are 64"" tall and 1 who is 60"" tall. 

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Charisma's walking schedule. She works 8 hours a day and takes a 5-minute break every hour. To find out how many minutes she walks in a day, we multiply the number of hours she works by the number of minutes she walks per hour.

8 hours * 5 minutes per hour = 40 minutes per day

Since Charisma works for 5 days, we multiply the daily minutes by the number of days.

40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how old Brett will be in four years. Since he's 14 now, we add 4 to his current age: 14 + 4 = 18.

Next, we know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, we multiply Brett's current age by 3: 14 * 3 = 42.

Now, we need to find out how old Angela will be in four years. We already know that's 42. To find her current age, we subtract 4 from 42: 42 - 4 = 38.

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is 14 days * $6 per day = $84.

The cost of the afternoon rides is 14 days * $2 per day = $28.

The total cost is $84 + $28 = $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"Let's calculate how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has a total of 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so to find out how many pies they can make, we need to divide the total number of oranges by 3.

120 / 3 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two venues to choose from, and we want to find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of the number of guests. However, it doesn't include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends. So, the total cost for the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost).

The second venue charges $25 per person who attends, and food for each guest is already included in the price. Therefore, the total cost for the second venue is $25x (per person charge).

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. We can do this by setting the cost of the first venue equal to the cost of the second venue:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x. Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Next, divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects. So, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. 

We can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we need to calculate the yards used by each of them separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the yards used by Mariah. She used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we can multiply 364 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 364 by 4.

364 ÷ 4 = 91 yards

Now, let's find the yards used by Mariah's grandma. She used 1/2 of a skein of yarn, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/2 of 364, we can multiply 364 by 1/2, which is the same as dividing 364 by 2.

364 ÷ 2 = 182 yards

Now that we have the yards used by Mariah and her grandma, we can add them together to find the total yards used.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Cherrie's gift-giving situation. She has 5 friends in total. 2 of them want 5 gifts each, and the other 3 want 2 gifts each.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts for the friends who want 5 gifts each: 2 friends * 5 gifts = 10 gifts.
Next, let's calculate the total number of gifts for the friends who want 2 gifts each: 3 friends * 2 gifts = 6 gifts.
Now, we add the gifts for both groups: 10 gifts + 6 gifts = 16 gifts.
Cherrie also decided to surprise her friends with 10 more random gifts. To find the total number of gifts she bought, we add these to the previous total: 16 gifts + 10 gifts = 26 gifts.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so we can find the rug's width by adding 5 to the chair's width. 
Rug's width = chair's width + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Now, we need to find the length of the couch. It's 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. 
Twice the width of the rug = 2 * 8 = 16 feet.
The couch is 2 feet longer than this, so the couch's length = 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given: Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She got 2 packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, we need to find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost.

Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

Since the total cost is $7, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"Let's figure out how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make with his budget. He wants to buy the cheapest lumber to save money.

First, we need to find out how many sticks he can get from each type of wood per dollar. A 2 x 4 piece of wood gives 200 sticks and costs $4, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50. On the other hand, a 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks and costs $6, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67 (round down to 66.67 since we can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood).

Since 66.67 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Mario needs to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs. Each dog has 4 legs, and he needs a pair of snowshoes for each dog. To find the total number of snowshoes needed, we multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs per dog: 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of snowshoes: 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we need to find the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair: 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Janet takes two bus trips five days a week. If each bus trip costs her $2.20, let's calculate how much she spends on bus trips in a week.

First, we need to find out the total number of bus trips Janet takes in a week. Since she takes two bus trips a day and there are five days in a week, we multiply the number of trips per day by the number of days in a week.

Number of trips per day: 2
Number of days in a week: 5
Total weekly trips: 2 * 5 = 10

Now, we multiply the total number of trips by the cost of one bus trip to find out the total weekly cost.

Cost of one bus trip: $2.20
Total weekly trips: 10
Total weekly cost: $2.20 * 10 = $22.00

Since Janet can buy a weekly bus pass for $20, let's calculate how much she would save by buying the pass instead of paying the total weekly cost.

Weekly bus pass cost: $20
Total weekly cost: $22.00
Amount saved: $22.00 - $20 = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the information given:

The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, which means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals: 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

However, this equation is not necessary. We can simply use the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. This means that the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 1/4 of the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.

The total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. To find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can divide this total by 4:
16 / 4 = 4

So, Sophia bought 4 onions and potatoes in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find out how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day to reach his goal, we first need to determine the number of days he has to lose the weight. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5 calories per day.

The final answer is: 614"

"Let's break down Julie's expenses step by step.

First, Julie spent 20% of her initial $500 on clothes. To find 20% of $500, we multiply 0.2 by $500, which equals $100. So, she spent $100 on clothes.

Now, we subtract $100 from the initial $500 to find the remaining money: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find 25% of $400, we multiply 0.25 by $400, which equals $100. So, she spent $100 on CDs.

Finally, we subtract $100 from the remaining $400 to find out how much money Julie has left: $400 - $100 = $300.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know that the house cost three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the canvas bags. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. To find the total number of bags, we multiply the number of packs by the number of bags in each pack: 8 * 5 = 40 bags. 

Now, we multiply the total number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost: 40 bags * $4 = $160.

Next, we need to find the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so we multiply the number of bags by the selling price: 40 bags * $8 = $320.

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 
Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

Next, Ali gives his sister half of the total money. 
Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. 
3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) * $80 = $48
Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Martha's wool shopping list.

To determine how many skeins of wool Martha needs, let's calculate the total for each item she wants to make for her triplets.

For hats, it takes 2 skeins of wool per hat, and she has 3 children, so she'll need 3 * 2 = 6 skeins of wool for the hats.

For scarves, it takes 4 skeins of wool per scarf, and she has 3 children, so she'll need 3 * 4 = 12 skeins of wool for the scarves.

For sweaters, it takes 12 skeins of wool per sweater, and she has 3 children, so she'll need 3 * 12 = 36 skeins of wool for the sweaters.

For mittens, it takes 1 skein of wool per pair, and she has 3 children, so she'll need 3 * 1 = 3 skeins of wool for the mittens.

For socks, it takes 2 skeins of wool per pair, and she has 3 children, so she'll need 3 * 2 = 6 skeins of wool for the socks.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Jackson's tulip problem.

To find out how many rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to calculate the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips separately.

For the red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6

For the blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Heather has a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins in it. She wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with the raisins. A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins.

To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. So, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we need to figure out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, 5 people can paint half a house in 5 / 5 = 1 day. 

Now, if 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days (because 2 * 0.5 = 1).

To convert the time from days to hours, we multiply the number of days by 24. So, 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set, spending a total of $48. To find out how many more CDs he could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to first determine how much money he spent on the headphone set.

The money spent on the headphone set is the total money spent minus the money spent on the CD. So, money spent on the headphone set = $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. The number of CDs that could have been bought is the money spent on the headphone set divided by the cost of one CD. Therefore, the number of CDs that could have been bought = $44 / $4 = 11.

Next, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CD. This is simply the total money divided by the cost of one CD, which is $48 / $4 = 12.

To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we subtract the number of CDs he could have bought from the total number of CDs he could have bought. Therefore, the number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 12 - 1 = 11.

However, the question asks for how many more CDs Tom could have bought, not the total number of CDs he could have bought without the headphone set. Since he could have bought 12 CDs with the money, and he actually bought 1 CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is 12 - 1 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down Josh's workout routine. He spent 4 hours working out every week except for a few occasions. There was a time when he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, and another time when he spent 6 hours in one week.

To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours, the weeks where he spent 5 hours, and the week where he spent 6 hours.

For the weeks where he spent 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (since 8 - 2 = 6). 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week where he spent 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add up the total hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Now, let's find out how many passengers get on at the second stop. It's mentioned that 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times the number of passengers who got off (21) fewer passengers get on. 3 times 21 is 63, so 63 fewer passengers get on. Since we are looking for the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This means that 63 more passengers got on.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122.

The final answer is: 122"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age:
   Difference = Jame's current age - cousin's current age
             = 22 - 47
             = -25

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference:
   Difference = | -25 |
             = 25

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer = $2,400
2. Cost of the computer = $1,100
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, we need to find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's dive into the problem. We have 20 kids on a school trip, and they're divided into two equal groups of girls and boys for a scavenger hunt. The boys go out and bring back 60 seashells each. Now, the girls bring back an amount equal to the number of shells the boys brought, plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

First, let's find out how many seashells the boys brought in total. Since there are 10 boys and each brought 60 seashells, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

Now, let's calculate how many seashells the girls brought. They brought an amount equal to the number of shells the boys brought (600) plus four times as many seashells as the boys (4 * 60 = 240). So, the girls brought 600 + 240 = 840 seashells.

Since there are 10 girls, we need to divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought. 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

Let's say George had x candies initially. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies initially.

Now, George ate 5 candies, so he has x - 5 candies left. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation x - 5 = 3.

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation, which gives us x = 8.

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find out how many candies Nick had. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you figure out Anne's age.

To find Anne's age, we need to find Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we subtract 4 from Chenny's age to get Alyana's age.

Chenny is 10 years old, so Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6.

Now, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we add 2 to Alyana's age to get Anne's age.

Alyana's age is 6, so Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's calculate the total thickness of the four books.

The first book is 31 mm thick.

The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 = 81
81 + 45 = 126
126 + 62 = 188

Total vlogs made in the first week: 18
Total vlogs made in the second week: 21
Total vlogs made in the third week: 15
Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, let's subtract the total vlogs made from the total vlogs Emma aims to make:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to get his initial share. $18 / 3 = $6.

Next, he added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

Then, he added another $10, so he had $11 + $10 = $21.

After that, he spent $8 from his total, so he had $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he had $13 * 3 = $39.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we need to determine the amount he saves each day in the first half and then double it.

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's denote the amount saved in the first half as y. Then, the amount saved in the second half will be 2y.

The total amount saved in the first half is xy, and the total amount saved in the second half is 2xy.

The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation: 3xy = 1125.

Since x is the number of days in the first half, and the total number of days in April is 30, we can write x + (30 - x) = 30, which simplifies to 30 = 30, and x = 15.

Now we can substitute x = 15 into the equation 3xy = 1125 to find y: 3(15)y = 1125, which simplifies to 45y = 1125.

To find y, we divide both sides by 45: y = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Verna's shopping problem.

To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the apples. Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each, so the total cost of the apples is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the oranges. Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each, so the total cost of the oranges is 5 x $0.80 = $4.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the peaches. Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each, so the total cost of the peaches is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

"Let's break down the problem. Jeff and Brad are trying to divide 100 dollars between them, and Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of what Jeff and Brad get is 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total miles he walks in a week. Jeff works 5 times a week, so the total miles he walks in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 miles.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters from the first two times, and the 13 letters from the third time. So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. So, the total number of letters she has written is 65 + 65 = 130.

Now, let's figure out how many pages she read in the first week. Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. To do this, we'll calculate a third of 12. 
A third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.

Next, we need to find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate. To do this, we'll calculate a quarter of 12.
A quarter of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

Now, we need to find out how many sandwiches are left. 
Cody and Trevor ate a total of 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

So, the number of sandwiches left is 12 - 7 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's solve the problem together. 

Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x. 

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7. 

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.
This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.
This simplifies to x = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00, so the total for these teeth is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

We know that Richie scored 80 goals. We also know that he scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna.

To find out how many goals Mark scored, we need to subtract 20 from Richie's total goals: 80 - 20 = 60.

To find out how many goals Anna scored, we need to subtract 45 from Richie's total goals: 80 - 45 = 35.

Now, let's add up the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"Let's break down the problem. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so we need to multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade to find out how much he made. 

21 * 4 = 84

Now, we need to find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam. To do that, we'll subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made.

84 - 63 = 21

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam."
"Let's break down Peter's action figure purchases. He has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures, which cost $5 each. 

In 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures. Since he spent $20, he bought 20 / 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures, which cost $2 each. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left. He has 5 days left, so the total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 50 / 2 = 25.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of Leah's new kitten.

To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200. 
The cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is: 
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

The final answer is: 100"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount removed from the account and subtract it from the initial amount.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

The amount removed each month is $100, so the total amount removed in 24 months is 24 x $100 = $2400.

The initial amount in the account is $3000.

The remaining amount in the account after 2 years is $3000 - $2400 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break down the costs and revenue for the food truck.

To find the total cost, we need to consider the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. The bread costs $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. The cheese and condiments cost $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. Since they're selling 10 sandwiches, they need to buy 1 set of cheese and condiments.

Total cost = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. 

Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, which means she has a total of 3 * 64 = 192 crayons. 

To make a muffin crayon, she melts 8 crayons together. To find out how many muffin crayons she can make, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8. 

192 / 8 = 24

Since each muffin crayon sells for $1.50, Kate can make 24 * $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and the cost of the materials and labor.

First, let's find the area of the bedroom. The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new carpet. The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

Now, let's add up the cost of the materials: $2592 (carpet) + $432 (padding) = $3024. Then, add the cost of removing the old carpet, which is $864. So, the total cost of the materials is $3024 + $864 = $3888.

Next, let's add up the cost of the labor: $864 (removing the old carpet) + $7344 (installing the new carpet) = $8208.

Finally, let's add the cost of the materials and the labor to get the total cost: $3888 (materials) + $8208 (labor) = $12196.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final value of the number train.

First, we start with a value of 20. 

Next, we need to find half of this value, which is 20 / 2 = 10.

Now, we add the starting value to half of the value, so 20 + 10 = 30.

Then, we divide the resulting value by 5, which gives us 30 / 5 = 6.

Finally, we multiply the resulting value by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."

"Let's figure out the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. 

First, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off. To do this, we'll find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18.
The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to find the actual temperature for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. We'll add 4% of 520 to 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The actual temperature for the recipe is 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

However, Maggie can't set the oven to a fraction of a degree. To find the temperature she should set the oven to, we need to subtract the percentage by which the oven is off from the actual temperature.

The temperature she should set the oven to is 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature she should set the oven to is 499.

The final answer is: 499"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total time Max will spend watching the two movies.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply the hours by 60 and then add the remaining minutes. So, 1 hour is 1 * 60 = 60 minutes, and adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives us 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the value of Juan's house. To do this, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

Herb's house price is $76,000. To find 30% of this, we multiply $76,000 by 0.3. 
0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800

Now, we subtract $22,800 from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price.
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now that we have the value of both houses, we can find the combined value by adding Herb's house price and Juan's house price together.
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Judy bought a dozen cups for the charity event, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so that's 24 dishes. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, which means her friend brought 44 dishes.

Let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Total Judy brought: 12 + 24 = 36

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought:

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will use in total. Since 90 single-use contacts last him 45 days, we can find the number of pairs he uses per day:
90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

Now, let's find the total number of days the contacts will last:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, he will use a total of 180 contacts.

Next, we need to find the cost of the contacts. The original price of 2 boxes is $200, but there's a 10% discount:
$200 * 0.10 = $20
$200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Tabitha agreed to pay John and Jill $10 an hour to help clean out her attic and basement.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"Let's break down Hannah's activities. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour. 

First, we need to find the total calories burned. For aerobics, that's 2 hours * 500 calories/hour, which equals 1000 calories. For running, it's 1 hour * 600 calories/hour, which equals 600 calories. 

Now, let's add those together: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units there are. That's 1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 to find out how many ml of water she needs to drink: 8 * 100 = 800.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. The note on the jar tells us that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (since it's 1% fewer than blue jelly beans) and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B (since it's 1% more than blue jelly beans).

We can write an equation based on the total number of jelly beans: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500. Combining like terms, we get 3.01B = 4500.

To find the value of B, we divide both sides of the equation by 3.01: B = 4500 / 3.01 = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is 0.99 * 1500 = 1485, and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given two different breakfast options for Martin: eating Cheerios every day or eating donuts every day. We need to find the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two options.

First, let's calculate the weight change for each option. If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds per week. If he eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds per week.

To find the total weight change after 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly weight change by 5.

Weight lost per week: -1.25 pounds
Weight gained per week: 1.75 pounds

Weight change after 5 weeks:
-1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds (lost)
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds (gained)

Now, let's find the difference in weight between the two options. To do this, we subtract the weight gained from the weight lost.

Difference in weight: 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we need to first determine how much protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve the problem together.

Let's say Jerry's current age is 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be written as an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

"Let's break down George's dental work costs. Each implant has a base price of $2000, and he needs 2 implants, so the total base price is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600. To find the remaining amount he needs to pay, we subtract the deposit from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, let's calculate how many hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount. He makes $15 per hour at work. To find the number of hours, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a triangle, and we know that the sum of its three angles is 180 degrees. One angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle.

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Then, the other two angles are 2x and 3x.

The sum of the three angles is x + 2x + 3x = 180. Combining like terms, we get 6x = 180.

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 6. This gives us x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees, and the other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

Since we're looking for the largest angle, we compare the three angles: 30, 60, and 90 degrees. The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's calculate how many gumballs Colby can buy. 

First, we need to convert all the coins into cents. 8 quarters equal 8 x 25 cents, which is 200 cents. 6 dimes equal 6 x 10 cents, which is 60 cents. 14 nickels equal 14 x 5 cents, which is 70 cents. And 15 pennies equal 15 x 1 cent, which is 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents

Now, I add 4 pounds to 8 pounds to get the new weight. 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, Jamaal finds this weight too heavy, so he uses a weight that's two pounds lighter than this. To find the final weight, I subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down Steve's game collection over the years. 

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 24 = 29 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 48 = 53 games in the third year.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve gets in 3 years: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

The additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. Since he makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, we can divide 120 by 2 to get the hourly rate. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates per hour for Ruiz.

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. It's given that she makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 

To find Marissa's hourly rate, we multiply Ruiz's hourly rate by 3/4. 
60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds of chocolates per hour for Marissa.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"Let's break down Howard's spending at the arcade. On Monday, he spent $8. On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16. On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

To find the total amount he spent, we add these amounts together: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Since Howard originally had $100, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount to find out how much he has left: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down Patrick's lemonade sales. For the first four hours, he sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. To find the total amount earned, we need to multiply the number of cups sold by the price per cup.

Total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total amount earned in 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total amount earned in 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, let's add the total amount earned from both periods to find the overall earnings.
Total amount earned in 6 hours = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To find out how many years the tires can last before they need to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires can handle and divide it by the number of rotations per month.

First, let's find out how many times the tires rotate in a month. Since the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile.

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. To find out how many months the tires can last, we'll divide the total rotations allowed by the rotations per month.

Months before replacement = 10,440,000 rotations / 290,000 rotations/month
Months before replacement = 36 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = 36 months / 12 months/year
Years before replacement = 3 years

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the cost per pump of the shampoo, we need to first determine the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equal to 2400 cents. 

To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price, which is $25. To find 30% of $25, we multiply 0.3 by $25, which equals $7.5.

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt by subtracting the discount from the original price: $25 - $7.5 = $17.5.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the items. We add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.5 + $35 = $52.5.

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately. Now, let's find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase. We subtract the total cost from the amount Joe has: $50 - $52.5 = -$2.5.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.5"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need to make croissants, we need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make and then multiply it by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of croissants is:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, the total number of croissants is:
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street: 194 * 490 = $95,060

To find how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to first find the cost to repave Monica's street and then subtract that from the cost to repave Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street: 194 * 150 = $29,100

Now, subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street: 
$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

John initially receives $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. After that, his research takes 10 times longer, which means it lasts for 5 * 10 = 50 months.

For the first 5 months, the cost is a straightforward $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months, the funding increases by 50% of the initial amount. 50% of $100,000 is $50,000, so the new funding is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

To find the total cost for the remaining 45 months, we multiply the increased funding by the number of months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Now, we add the cost for the first 5 months to the cost for the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The final answer is: $6,850,000"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Gary does laundry twice a week, which means he does laundry 52 times in a year (since there are 52 weeks in a year). 

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. To find the total amount of water used in a year, we multiply the number of times Gary does laundry by the amount of water used per load: 52 * 20 = 1040 gallons.

Now, we need to find out how much this water costs. A gallon of water costs $0.15. To find the total cost, we multiply the total amount of water used by the cost per gallon: 1040 * $0.15 = $156.

The final answer is: $156"
"Let's break down the costs of all the items Scarlett bought.

First, she found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale. Then, she bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each, which is a total of 2 x $2.50 = $5.00. Next, she purchased 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each, which is 3 x $2.00 = $6.00. 

After that, she bought 20 fish at $0.50 each, which is 20 x $0.50 = $10.00. Finally, she needed fish food that cost $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together:
$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row.

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Now, let's find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the total seats were occupied by the administrators.

Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Next, we need to find out how many seats were left after the administrators occupied their seats. We subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Now, let's find out how many seats were occupied by the parents. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.

Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Finally, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the students. We subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.

"Hi there, let's break down Jim's gum-chewing habits. He has a 20-pack of gum and spends 8 hours at school. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, we can calculate the gum he chews at school by dividing the total school hours by 2.

8 hours / 2 = 4 pieces of gum

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, adding 2 more pieces to the total. So, he's chewed 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum so far.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he's already chewed from the initial 20 pieces: 
20 - 6 = 14

However, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister before bed. To find out how many pieces he gives her, we need to divide the remaining gum by 2:

"Let's break down James' earnings from selling the used cars.

First, we need to find the total cost of the cars. Since James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, the total cost is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we need to calculate the company's cost to acquire the cars. They paid 30% of the total cost, which is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

Now, let's find the profit from selling the cars. The profit is the total cost minus the company's cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, we need to calculate James' commission on the profit. He earns a 10% commission, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that when a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. This means 25% of 100 riders can stay on the wave.

To find 25% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.25:
100 * 0.25 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is:
25 - 15 = 10

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. If the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold Jewell as follows:

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * Price of diamond Jewell
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Next, we're told that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we can calculate the price of the silver Jewell as follows:

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, to find the total price for all three jewels, we simply add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Tom is driving at a speed of 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving 55 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, we need to find out how long it will take for Tom to catch up.

To do this, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. This is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.

Now, we can use the formula Time = Distance / Relative Speed to find the time it will take for Tom to catch up. The distance between them is 75 miles, and the relative speed is 15 mph.

Time = Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Total cost of classes = $60
Number of classes = 10

Cost per class = Total cost of classes / Number of classes
Cost per class = $60 / 10
Cost per class = $6

Since Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's say Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and y classes at $10 per class. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

6x + 10y = 60

Since Manny can't attend a fraction of a class, we need to find the maximum whole number of classes he can attend at $6 per class.

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 1, 6(1) + 10y = 60
6 + 10y = 60
10y = 54
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 6(2) + 10y = 60
12 + 10y = 60
10y = 48
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 6(3) + 10y = 60
18 + 10y = 60
10y = 42
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 4, 6(4) + 10y = 60
24 + 10y = 60
10y = 36
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Hello there. I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total weekly production, we need to determine how many customers each person processes in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie's daily production is 50 * 2 = 100 customers.

Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges for Clyde.

First, we need to find the cost of 5 apples. Since 4 apples cost $5.20, we can multiply this by 5/4 to find the cost of 5 apples.
Cost of 5 apples = $5.20 * (5/4) = $6.50

Next, we need to find the cost of 5 oranges. Since 3 oranges cost $3.30, we can multiply this by 5/3 to find the cost of 5 oranges.
Cost of 5 oranges = $3.30 * (5/3) = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the hole) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can find the total time it will take him to dig the hole by multiplying the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

The final answer is: 216"
"Let's break down the costs of Bill's new truck. The base price of the truck is $30,000. 

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500. 

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary. To do this, we multiply $20,000 by 0.05, which is the decimal form of 5%. This gives us $1,000. Now, we add this to his original salary to get his new monthly salary: $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary. We do this by dividing $20,000 by 2, which gives us $10,000.

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income by adding the new monthly salary and the bonus: $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

Finally, we multiply the total monthly income by 12 to get the total annual income: $31,000 * 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"Let's break down the costs of James' new wardrobe.

First, we need to find the cost of the suits. James bought 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, which is $750 * 1/5 = $150 per pair. Since James bought 10 pairs of dress pants, the total cost of the pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James bought 3 dress shirts for each of the 10 suits, so he bought a total of 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we add up the costs of the suits, pants, and shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total number of articles published by the news website and its sister company in February.

To find the total number of articles published by both websites, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles (news website) + 280 articles (sister company) = 840 articles

The final answer is: 840"
"Let's break down the information given. Steve is 60 years old, and his wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 64 years old.

Since their son is half as old as his mom, he is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Now, we need to find the age of Steve's son's wife. We know she is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to first find the total amount of flour in one bag and then multiply it by 3.

Each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, so the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3 to find the total amount of flour in three bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's calculate the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley.

Alisa biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time: 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles.

Stanley biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time: 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles.

Now, let's add their individual distances to find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley: 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Bill needs to dig through 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay. He can dig 4 feet of soil per hour, but only half that speed through clay, which is 2 feet per hour.

To find the time it takes to dig through the soil, we divide the total feet of soil by the speed: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

For the clay, we do the same: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to get the total time: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Fishio posted her selfie on Instagram. She received 2000 likes on the photo after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. If she received 20000 more new likes recently, how many Instagram likes are there?

To find the total number of likes, we need to calculate the number of likes after 3 weeks. Since the number of likes after 3 weeks is 70 times the initial number of likes, we can multiply the initial number of likes by 70.

Initial likes = 2000
Likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000

However, we are not given the number of likes received in 3 weeks, but we are given that she received 20000 more new likes recently. Since the number of likes after 3 weeks is 140000, the number of likes received in 3 weeks is 140000 - 2000 = 138000.

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the total number of likes after 3 weeks.

Total likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000

The final answer is: 160000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. However, she got a $2 discount because she had a voucher. To find the total cost, we need to subtract the discount from the total price:
20 * $20 = $400
$400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of pomegranates increased to $30 each, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. First, let's find the total cost without the discount:
20 * $30 = $600
Now, we need to calculate the discount, which is 10% of $600:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
To find the total cost with the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$540 - $398 = $142

"Let's break down Ariadne's sales. In a particular month, her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total sales from green hats in that month ""x"". Then, the sales from red hats in that month is $400, which is half of x, so x/2 = $400.

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = $400 * 2 = $800.

So, in that month, Ariadne's total sales from green hats were $800 and from red hats were $400.

The total sales in that month are $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

So, the total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how much was withheld from Sally's wage. 

To do this, we need to find out how much she should have had in her account if she received her full wage. 

Her expected wage is $300, and her account initially had $200. So, the expected total amount in her account should be $300 + $200 = $500.

Since she actually has $420 in her account, we can find the difference between the expected total and the actual amount to determine how much was withheld.

Actual amount: $420
Expected total: $500
Withheld amount: $500 - $420 = $80

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine how many eggs Lori needs for her party, we first need to find out how many deviled egg halves her guests will eat. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she's inviting 16 guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves per guest.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves she needs to make. We already know she needs 48 deviled egg halves.

Number of deviled egg halves needed: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12.

Number of eggs needed: 24
Number of eggs in a dozen: 12
Number of dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Mike's teacher assigned him a 200-page book to read within 30 days. Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. To find out how many days it will take him to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish the book
= 30 - 20
= 10

"Let's break down the costs associated with James' plane. The initial cost of the plane is $150,000. 

In addition to the plane's purchase price, James also has to pay for a hanger rental. The monthly hanger rental is $5000. To find the total hanger rental cost for a year, we multiply this by 12: $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, so it is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. To find the total fuel cost for a year, we multiply this by 12: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, let's add up the costs: the plane's purchase price, the hanger rental, and the fuel cost. $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two mixtures of nuts: one with 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, and the other with 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

First, we need to find the cost of each mixture. A pound of almonds costs $10, and a pound of walnuts costs $15.

For the first mixture, the cost of almonds is 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5, and the cost of walnuts is 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5. So, the total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture, the cost of almonds is 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2, and the cost of walnuts is 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5. So, the total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures. The difference is $10 - $7 = $3.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4S + 2G = 70.

Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, the total number of heads can be represented as S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut. 

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42. 
The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money by multiplying 120 by 3/4. 
Kassidy's money = (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Now, we know Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we add 60 to Kassidy's money to find out how much Rayna has.
Rayna's money = 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

To find out how much each person would have if they decided to add their money together and share it equally, we need to add up the money of all three and divide it by 3.
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.
Money per person = 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

"Let's solve the problem. We're given that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Sally has.

Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. We can express Janey's books as 2x + 3, since it's 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. Since Janey has 21 books, we can write the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in the backyard grows up to 30 inches a day. Today, its height is 20 feet. We need to figure out how many days it will take for its height to reach 600 inches.

First, let's convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 4 + 8 = 12.

When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. This means there are a total of 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12 + 28 = 40.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means the total number of toys needed is 40 - 3 = 37.

The final answer is: 37"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we can calculate this by multiplying 2/5 by $1200.

2/5 * 1200 = (2 * 1200) / 5 = 2400 / 5 = 480

Now, we need to find out how much money is left after Dylan's investment. We can do this by subtracting Dylan's investment from the total amount.

1200 - 480 = 720

Next, we need to find out how much Frances invested. Since Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, we can calculate this by multiplying 2/3 by 720.

2/3 * 720 = (2 * 720) / 3 = 1440 / 3 = 480

Now, we need to find out how much money is left after Frances' investment. We can do this by subtracting Frances' investment from the remaining amount.

720 - 480 = 240

This means that Skyler's investment is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Carol and Jennifer have been collecting signatures from celebrities, and they want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. Currently, Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures.

To find out how many signatures they have in total, we add the number of signatures each sister has.

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

Now, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal.

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

So, the sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of 100 signatures.

The final answer is: 36"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's figure out how many hash browns we can make from 96 potatoes. 

To do this, we need to find the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows: 

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

Now, let's use this ratio to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes. We can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

We can then cross-multiply to solve for x:

6x = 96 * 36
6x = 3456
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: 576"
"Let's calculate the total weight of the 9 adults riding the elevator. 

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the difference between the total weight of the 9 adults and the maximum load.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Max has 5 less cookies than Katarina, we can find Max's total by subtracting 5 from Katarina's cookies: 68 - 5 = 63 cookies for Max.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we subtract 12 from Max's total: 63 - 12 = 51 cookies for the Cookie Monster.

Now, we know Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. To find Summer's total, we add 23 to Max's total: 63 + 23 = 86 cookies for Summer.

To find the total number of cookies, we add up the number of cookies each person has: 68 (Katarina) + 63 (Max) + 51 (Cookie Monster) + 86 (Summer) = 268

The final answer is: 268"
"I'm Yumi, and I'd be happy to help Shania with her dress design. 

Let's break down the problem. The final design of the dress is 140cm long, and it was extended by 50% of its original length, plus an additional 20cm. 

Let's call the original length of the dress 'x'. The extension is 50% of x, which is 0.5x. Adding 20cm to this extension gives us 0.5x + 20.

The final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: x + (0.5x + 20) = 140.

Combine like terms: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120.

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Chris's lawn-mowing adventure. He has a two-speed lawn mower that can mow his entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes) in ""turtle"" mode or 40 minutes in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to calculate the time for each mode and then add them together. 

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, let's add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem together. John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school. They need to get to the corner where the library is first, which takes 6 minutes. Then, it takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have. 

Time to get to the fire station = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Time left to get to school = Total time they have - Time to get to the fire station
Time left to get to school = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left to get to school = 11 minutes

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Greta and Celinda are baking cookies, and I'd be happy to help you figure out how many are left in the box.

Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta. To find out how many cookies Celinda bakes, we multiply Greta's number by 2. So, Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies they baked. Greta has 30 cookies, and Celinda has 60 cookies, so together they have 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

After baking, they eat 10 cookies while they're cooling. To find out how many cookies are left, we subtract 10 from the total number of cookies. So, 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, we need to find the age of one of the twins.

Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

We have two equations based on the given information:

1. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, the problem asks for the age of one of the twins, and since we have two twins, we need to find the age of the older twin.

The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how much time John has to nap.

To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John spends on homework:
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Now, let's subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner:
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies that cost a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. To find the cost of one candy, we need to subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost.

The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. Now, let's subtract this from the total cost: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. This is the cost of 4 candies.

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Rong saves 20 coins every month, and Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we need to calculate 2/5 of 20, which is 8. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, which cost $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"Let's break down the cost of the fruits in the crate. 

First, we need to find the cost of one banana. Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs twice as much, which is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we find the cost of one orange, which is three times as much as a banana. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

Let's start with the number of red squares: 14. 
Next, we know there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.
Then, there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.
Lastly, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, let's add the number of squares of each color together: 
14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

The total number of squares is 68. Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Mia's restaurant is expecting 42 adults and 15 babies tomorrow. To figure out how many chairs she needs, we first need to know how many regular chairs she has. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and she has 8 high chairs, we can multiply 8 by 5 to find the number of regular chairs.

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Now, let's add up the total number of chairs needed. We have 42 adults and 15 babies, so that's a total of 57 chairs needed.

Total number of chairs needed = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57

Mia already has 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs, which gives her a total of 48 chairs.

Total number of chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs needed.

Number of chairs needed to be added = Total number of chairs needed - Total number of chairs available
= 57 - 48
= 9

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many points the class is missing to go on a trip.

Let's start by looking at the points collected by each student. Adam has 50 points. Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find out how many points that is, we need to calculate 30% of 50. 

30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. 
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Now, let's look at Tom. We know he has 30 points less than Betty. 
So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
So, Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

The total points collected by the class is 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. 
The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4:
0.4 * 300 = 120

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard display. She will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard display is 3 * 5 = 15.

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

To find the capacity of Gary's truck, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds
Capacity of Gary's truck = Total capacity - Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know there are 8 males and 6 females in the group. To find the total number of people, we add the number of males and females: 8 + 6 = 14.

Next, we're told that each female ate 3 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. To find the total number of dumplings eaten by males, we multiply the number of males by the number of dumplings each male ate: 8 * 4 = 32.

Now, we add the total number of dumplings eaten by females and males to find the total number of dumplings eaten: 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, and the cat can run 15 feet per second. To find out how many feet her turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we need to figure out the turtle's speed first.

Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can divide the cat's speed by 5 to get the turtle's speed. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can use the turtle's speed to find the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = Speed of the turtle * 40
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, the local firefighters are doing a ""fill the boot"" fundraiser to raise $6300. After the first 3 hours, they've raised $2100. To find out how many hours they need to fundraise in total to reach their goal, assuming an equal amount raised in every hour, we need to calculate the amount they need to raise per hour.

Let's start by finding the amount raised per hour. We divide the total amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they've already raised $2100. The remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they've already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Now, we need to find out what percentage of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

First, we need to find out how much of the 40% is used for industrial purposes. Since 80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes, we can calculate this by multiplying 40% by 0.8. 

0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%. This means 32% of the river's total water is used by the city for industrial purposes.

Now, to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 
40% - 32% = 8%.

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two types of ice cream being produced: chocolate and vanilla.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate of chocolate ice cream, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

Now, let's look at the production rate of vanilla ice cream. The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate of vanilla ice cream, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now that we have the production rates for both types of ice cream, we can calculate the total quarts produced in 48 hours. For chocolate ice cream, it would be 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts. For vanilla ice cream, it would be 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts.

To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream together: 2400 + 600 = 3000.

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Erin wants to buy ice cream from a parlor that's offering a deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 free. Each scoop costs $1.50. Erin has $6.00 to spend. 

To figure out how many scoops Erin can get, let's first see how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00. We can do this by dividing $6.00 by $1.50.

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so Erin can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. To take advantage of the deal, Erin should buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops. 

The remaining $1.50 can be used to buy 1 more scoop, making it a total of 4 scoops.

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy have after two weeks.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. To find out how much candy they eat in two weeks, we need to multiply the number of pieces they eat per day by 14 (the number of days in two weeks).

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Now, let's find out how much candy each of them has left. Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Mr. Boarden is remodeling his bathroom, and he needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot. To find out how many tiles he needs to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we need to calculate two thirds of the total area.

Two thirds of 36 is calculated as (2/3) * 36 = (2 * 36) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24.

So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 sq ft. For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 sq ft, he would need 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"Let's calculate how much James saved by picking blueberries himself.

First, we need to find the total cost of picking the blueberries. The initial cost is $20, and then there's an additional $1.5 per pound. Since James picked 30 pounds, the total cost of picking the blueberries is $20 + $1.5 * 30 = $20 + $45 = $65.

Now, let's find the cost of buying the blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries for $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds, so the total cost at the store would be $2.5 * 30 = $75.

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store: $75 - $65 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total amount of money the company paid, we need to first find the new price of each computer. The original price of each computer was $700, but it's 10% higher than that.

10% of $700 is 0.1 x 700 = $70. 

The new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers. 

The total amount is 500 x $770 = $385,000.

The final answer is: $385,000"
"Let's break down the ingredients in John's omelet. He's using 6 eggs, 2 oz of cheese, and an equal amount of ham. 

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. Since each egg is 75 calories, 6 eggs would be 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

Next, we have the cheese. With 2 oz of cheese at 120 calories per oz, that's 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

Lastly, we have the ham. Since there's an equal amount of ham as cheese, that's also 2 oz. With 40 calories per oz, that's 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Now, let's add up the calories from all the ingredients: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The final answer is: 770"
"Let's calculate the total cost of the items you bought. 

First, we need to find the cost of the pencils. Since each pencil costs $0.50 and you bought 6 pencils, the total cost of the pencils is 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Next, we need to find the cost of the erasers. Each eraser costs $0.25, and you bought 8 erasers, so the total cost of the erasers is 8 * $0.25 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and the erasers together to get the total cost: $3 + $2 = $5.

Since you paid $10, the change you would get is $10 - $5 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people receive interviews. Since 30% of the applicants receive interviews, we can calculate this by multiplying 100 (the total number of applicants) by 0.3 (30% as a decimal).

100 * 0.3 = 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we need to find out how many of those who receive interviews receive a job offer. Since 20% of those who receive interviews receive a job offer, we can calculate this by multiplying 30 (the number of people who received interviews) by 0.2 (20% as a decimal).

30 * 0.2 = 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, we need to find out how many of those who receive a job offer accept the position. Since a third of those who receive a job offer accept the position, we can calculate this by dividing 6 (the number of people who received a job offer) by 3.

6 / 3 = 2 people accept the position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice and gave some to her cousin and brother. We know she gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. To find the total number of sacks she gave away, we simply add the sacks she gave to her cousin and brother.

Total sacks given away = 3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks

Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we multiply the total sacks given away by the weight of each sack.

Total kilograms given away = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

The final answer is: 175"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week.

To do that, we need to find the total number of boxes Castle bought this week. She bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, so the total number of boxes she bought this week is 3 + 5 = 8.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of boxes she bought this week and last week. To do that, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week: 8 - 4 = 4.

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"Let's break down Helga's clog dancing into two scenarios: when her arms are down and when her arms are up.

When her arms are down, Helga taps her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute and her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute. This means she taps a total of 550 times per minute. Since she dances for 3 minutes with her arms down, she taps a total of 550 * 3 = 1650 times.

When her arms are up, Helga taps her right and left feet at a rate of 200 taps per minute each. This means she taps a total of 400 times per minute. Since she dances for 2 minutes with her arms up, she taps a total of 400 * 2 = 800 times.

To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we add the total taps from both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"Let's break down the situation. Ron is worried about a pothole in front of his house that could cause $450 worth of damage to his car if it's not fixed. However, if he decides to fix it himself, the city council will fine him $120 for unauthorized road maintenance. Additionally, he'll need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of the asphalt. Since he needs 3 buckets, the total cost is 3 * $25 = $75.

Now, we need to add the fine to the cost of the asphalt to get the total cost of fixing the pothole: $75 + $120 = $195.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing it from the potential damage to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is: $255"
"Let's calculate the number of chairs left in the restaurant.

First, we need to find the total number of chairs sent for repair. There were 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs sent, so the total number of chairs sent for repair is 20 + 13 = 33.

Now, let's find the total number of chairs left. We have 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. If we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs, we get:

Total chairs left = 170 (normal chairs) + 23 (baby chairs) - 33 (chairs sent for repair)
Total chairs left = 193 - 33
Total chairs left = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people in total, including Bryce and his 4 friends.

First, let's find out how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

40 slices - 24 slices = 16 slices

Now, we know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

Total number of slices = 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices
Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 16 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. To find out how long it takes for a dog to eat the same number of sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat.

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog. To do this, we add the time taken by the cat and the dog, and then divide by 2.

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. To make calculations easier, we'll convert this to just inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply 8 by 12 to get 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches to that gives us a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each, and Hannah smashed a quarter of the windows. To find the total number of windows smashed from students' cars, we multiply the number of students' cars by the number of windows per car and then multiply by the fraction of windows smashed: (64 * 4) * (1/4) = 256 * (1/4) = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each, and Hannah smashed three-fourths of the windows. To find the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars, we multiply the number of teachers' cars by the number of windows per car and then multiply by the fraction of windows smashed: (32 * 2) * (3/4) = 64 * (3/4) = 48.

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars: 64 + 48 = 112.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 15 light blue spools, 45 dark blue spools, 40 light green spools, and 50 dark green spools. To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools.

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

At 8:00, 5000 people lined up at a polling station. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. To find out how many people voted by midday, we multiply 2/5 by 5000.

2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, we need to find out how many people were left after midday. That would be the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by midday.

5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were left after midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. To find out how many people voted by 16:00, we multiply 2/3 by the number of people left after midday.

2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

Now, we need to find out how many people had not voted by 16:00. That would be the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.

5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to figure out how many boxes of graham crackers are required for 9 kids and 6 adults.

First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed. The 9 kids want 2 smores each, so that's 9 * 2 = 18 smores. The 6 adults will each have 1 s'more, which is 6 * 1 = 6 smores. In total, they need 18 + 6 = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we need to divide the total number of smores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are required. That's 24 / 8 = 3 sleeves.

Now, we know that there are 3 sleeves in a box, so we need to divide the total number of sleeves required by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed. That's 3 / 3 = 1 box.

So, to make sure everyone gets their s'mores, we need 1 box of graham crackers.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Dora's age is given as 15 years. We need to find the ages of her father and mother to calculate the total combined age.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8 
= 2 * 15 + 8 
= 30 + 8 
= 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4 
= 38 - 4 
= 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age 
= 15 + 38 + 34 
= 87 years.

Now, we need to find out how much he saves in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = 50 * 7
Weekly savings = 350

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's break down the information given: Sean has 56 marbles. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find Cal's marbles by doubling Sean's amount: 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

Now, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. To find Carl's marbles, we multiply Sean's amount by 4: 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: 224 (Carl) + 112 (Cal) = 336.

The final answer is: 336"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, we have 54 students who need to be divided into groups. The activity actually requires 12 groups, but we're only given 6 groups. To find out how many more groups are needed, let's first figure out how many students should be in each group.

We divide the total number of students by the number of groups we have, which is 6. 

Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we know that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students needed, we multiply the number of groups by the students per group.

Total students required = 12 * 9
Total students required = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find out how many more students are required to form 12 groups.

Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

Since each group requires 9 students, we need to find the number of additional groups required.

Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month).

In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. 

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekend days: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, multiply the total chairs rented in a week by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month):
500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"Let's break down the sequence of events to find out how many bananas Gunther had at the end.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas, so the number of bananas left is 48 / 2 = 24.

Gunther added 25 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 24 + 25 = 49.

Arnold stole 12 bananas, so the number of bananas left is 49 - 12 = 37.

Gunther added 6 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 37 + 6 = 43.

The final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's break down the problem. Jenna has 4 roommates and the electricity bill is $100 per month. To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to divide the monthly bill by the number of roommates and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's divide the monthly bill by the number of roommates:

$100 / 4 = $25 per roommate per month.

Now, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 to get the yearly amount:

$25 * 12 = $300 per roommate per year.

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party. To find out how many glasses and plates he sent, we need to multiply the number of dozen by 12.

- Glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- Plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

When they were returned, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to subtract the number of broken items from the total number of items sent.

- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

Glasses left: 96 - 10 = 86
Plates left: 48 - 6 = 42

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

The final answer is: 86"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30 small stickers, we multiply 0.9 by 30, which equals 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. To find 50% of 40 large stickers, we multiply 0.5 by 40, which equals 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

Next, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers, 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons. To find the total number of buttons she has, we add these together: 3 + 20 + 27 + 20 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's talk about Joey's football matches. He played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and on Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday. To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add the matches played on Monday, Friday, and Saturday.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday. 
He played 1 match on Friday. 
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches played on each day: 
2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the council has 33 members and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. 

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many shirts Krissa needs to order for her preschool students.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that 11 students need size extra-small. Since twice as many students need size small as extra small, that's 2 * 11 = 22 students.

Next, we're told that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.

Now, half as many students need size large as size medium, which means 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.

Finally, six more students need size extra-large than large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 students.

To find the total number of shirts ordered, we add the number of students for each size together: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the final price after the discount, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The bag is marked at $140 and has a 5% discount. 

To find the discount, multiply the original price by the discount percentage (5% or 0.05).

Discount = $140 * 0.05 = $7

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price.

Final price = Original price - Discount
Final price = $140 - $7
Final price = $133

6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours

The total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is 60000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win the big race. To find this number, we multiply 0.2 by 50, which equals 10 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, the remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40.

60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. To find this number, we multiply 0.6 by 40, which equals 24 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. Since 24 people think horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 40 - 24 = 16 people.

The final answer is: 16"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's dive into the problem. We know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one third of those Pomeranians are girls. We're given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls.

Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can find the total number of Pomeranians by multiplying the number of girls by 3. So, 6 * 3 = 18. This means there are 18 Pomeranians in total.

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we found that there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply the number of Pomeranians by 3/2. So, 18 * (3/2) = 27.

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

The final answer is: 27"

Jayden initially had $70 from selling his pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. Now, let's add the amount he received from his sister to the amount he already had: $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for the three houses is 250. 

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles.

The third house needs double the first, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together. George has 45% more pears than bananas. If George has 200 bananas, we need to find out how many fruits he has in total.

First, let's calculate 45% of the number of bananas. To do this, we multiply 200 by 0.45. 

0.45 * 200 = 90

This means George has 90 more pears than bananas. Since he has 200 bananas, he must have 200 + 90 = 290 pears.

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears together.

Total number of fruits = 200 (bananas) + 290 (pears)
Total number of fruits = 490

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find out how many Ahmed read. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Next, we know Ezra decided to read 150 more books. So, the total number of books Ezra will read is 300 + 150 = 450.

Now, we need to find the total number of books both Ezra and Ahmed read. 

Total books read by Ahmed = 150
Total books read by Ezra = 450
Total books read by both = 150 + 450 = 600

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Tanya's earnings.

To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches less than 3 classes, she does not earn an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, the perfume company has 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available. They sold 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents. To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

For the vanilla scents, they sold 5 of each of the 4 available scents, so that's a total of 5 * 4 = 20 vanilla scents sold.

For the fruity scents, they sold 2 of each of the 8 available scents, so that's a total of 2 * 8 = 16 fruity scents sold.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold.

Difference = Number of vanilla scents sold - Number of fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"Let's break down Bennet's situation. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, which means he earns a total of 20 * 3 = $60 from the eggplants.

To reach his goal of $135, Bennet needs to make an additional $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

Since he has 25 ears of corn, we need to find out how much he should sell each ear for. To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"Let's break down Tatiana's weekend schedule. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which gives her a total of 12 hours for the weekend.

Tatiana spends 3 hours reading, so we need to find out how much time is left for other activities. That's 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends playing video games. She spends 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

To find the time she spends playing soccer, we subtract the time spent reading and playing video games from the total time. That's 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the weekend she spends playing soccer. We do this by dividing the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiplying by 100. That's (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"

First, let's calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. 

Time to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed = 150 / 75 = 2 hours
Time to drive back home = Distance / Speed = 150 / 75 = 2 hours

So, the total time Jack spends driving is 2 + 2 = 4 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mike wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions. He has a total of 600 movies. 

First, we need to find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of movies by 3:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:
200 * $6 = $1200

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

Now, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply the remaining movies by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot. 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma. Ava gets 10 points for every enemy she jumps on, 5 points for every berry she collects, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when she finishes the level. Emma gets the same points for the same actions.

We know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. However, Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. 

Let's assume Emma finishes the level in 60 seconds. Then, Ava finishes the level in 60 + 4 = 64 seconds.

The score for the enemies is 10 times the number of enemies jumped on. Let's call the number of enemies Emma jumps on 'x'. Then, the number of enemies Ava jumps on is x + 8. The score for the enemies is 10x for Emma and 10(x + 8) for Ava.

The score for the berries is 5 times the number of berries collected. Let's call the number of berries Emma collects 'y'. Then, the number of berries Ava collects is y + 3. The score for the berries is 5y for Emma and 5(y + 3) for Ava.

The score for the timer is 30 times the number of seconds left on the timer. Emma finishes the level in 60 seconds, so her timer score is 30 * 60 = 1800. Ava finishes the level in 64 seconds, so her timer score is 30 * 64 = 1920.

Now, we can calculate the total score for Emma and Ava. The total score for Emma is 10x + 5y + 1800. The total score for Ava is 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 1920.

We can simplify the total score for Ava: 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 1920 = 10x + 5y + 2015.

Now, we can find the difference in their scores by subtracting Emma's score from Ava's score: (10x + 5y + 2015) - (10x + 5y + 1800) = 215.

The final answer is: $\boxed{215}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known.

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas.

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. That's a total of 3 * 5 = 15 times. 

On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we add the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days: 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. He bought some more fish from the pet store, and after adding them to his pond, he found that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O. The total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so we can write the equation: W + O = 17.

We also know that after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be represented by the equation: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

Now, let's solve the second equation for O: O = 2(4 + W) - 3 = 8 + 2W - 3 = 5 + 2W.

Substitute this expression for O into the first equation: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combine like terms: 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Andy drives in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the total daily distance is 5 miles * 2 (to and from work) = 10 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total weekly distance: 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we need to find out how much fuel Andy's car consumes in a week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon (MPG), so we can calculate the fuel consumption: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we need to find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week. The current price for regular gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt to use for lunch. If she spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties, let's calculate the total amount of money she paid for the lunch.

First, we need to find the value of the quarters. Since there are 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, we need to find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie had 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3 and then divide by 5. This gives us (10 * 3) / 5 = 30/5 = 6. So, she spent 6 twenties. The value of 6 twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent to find the total amount of money she paid for lunch. $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants.

First, we need to find out how many tomatoes and eggplants he can harvest. 

For tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes
For eggplants: 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants

Now, let's add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants together: 110 + 32 = 142

The final answer is: 142"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that one-fourth of the TVs sold are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, John is trying to raise money for a school trip, and the school has kindly agreed to cover half of the cost. The trip costs $300. To figure out how much John is missing, I'll first calculate the amount the school will cover. 

Half of the trip cost is $300 / 2 = $150. Since the school is covering this amount, John will need to cover the remaining cost. To find out how much he's missing, I'll subtract the amount he has from the amount the school will cover.

Amount John is missing = Amount school will cover - Amount John has
= $150 - $50
= $100

The final answer is: $100"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point. 

The current temperature during the night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. 

The temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. 

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total number of seashells, we need to break it down into smaller steps. First, let's find the number of groups. We know that 90 people need to be split into groups, and each group has 9 people.

Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we need to find the number of groups that brought back seashells. We know that 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells.

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, let's find the total number of seashells. We know that each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells.

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's calculate the number of people on the train.

Initially, there were 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

The number of people on the train is 100.

"Let's calculate how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month. 

Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day on his way home, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. To find the total amount of money he makes, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the value of each bottle cap and then multiply the result by the number of days in the month.

First, let's calculate the daily amount:
10 bottle caps * $0.25 = $2.50 per day

Now, let's multiply the daily amount by the number of days in the month:
$2.50 * 30 = $75

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. 

First, let's start with the number of female lions, which is 12. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can find the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2: 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.
We also know there are 14 lion cubs.

Now, we can add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions: 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

So, Mike is looking for a new pair of jeans that originally cost $40. He finds out that they're 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage. 

Discount = 25% of $40
Discount = 0.25 * $40
Discount = $10

Now, let's find the price after the discount:
Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

Since Mike is paying with a $50 bill, we need to find out how much money he'll have left over:
Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. To find the total salary for each month, we multiply the number of employees by the salary per employee:
260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Billy's hourly wage after his raises. He was initially paid $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Then, on his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Sally's hourly wage. Her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Next, we need to find their total earnings after working 20 hours. Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230. Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the reforestation campaign at Ashley's school.

To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

First, let's find the total number of students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class, so we multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class.

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is equal to the total number of students.

Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Next, let's find the total number of teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class, so we multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class.

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is twice the total number of teachers.

Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the total number of trees planted.

Total trees planted = Total trees planted by students + Total trees planted by teachers
Total trees planted = 1000 + 240
Total trees planted = 1240

"Let's break down Kris's gaming schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks, which is 14 days. So, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

Then, she plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week, which is 7 days. So, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

To find the total hours Kris has played, we add the hours from both periods: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Now, to find out how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two cars on the highway, with the first car traveling at 60 miles per hour and the second car passing it at 70 miles per hour. We want to find out how many miles will separate them after 2 hours.

First, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. The distance traveled is equal to the speed multiplied by the time. So, for the first car:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

For the second car:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

Now, we need to find the distance between the two cars. This is the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours is 20 miles."
"Let's calculate the total cost of the ring. 

First, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. 

$600 + $300 = $900

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.3.

0.3 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold.

$900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid a total of $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340
- Fourth-graders: 40
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders, and the pass rate of fourth-graders is 40/100, the pass rate of fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to figure out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many chips he has in total.

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with 144 chips.

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it can be. We know that the area of a rectangle (such as the mosaic) is length * width. Since we know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), we can find the length.

Area = length * width
12 = length * 3
length = 12 / 3
length = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 4 students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

Next, 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party. To do this, we add the amount of tea drank to the amount of tea left. 

The amount of tea left is 10 quarts. 

Total tea at the beginning = 38 (tea drank) + 10 (tea left) = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4. 

48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies. Then, he sold 150 of them. To find out how many candies he has left, we need to subtract the number of candies he sold from the initial number of candies.

100 (initial candies) - 150 (candies sold) = -50

However, we can't have a negative number of candies, so this means Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold. Let's continue with the problem.

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. To find the total number of candies he has now, we add the initial number of candies to the additional number of candies he ordered.

100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200

Now, we need to find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell to sell all of his candy. We subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he has.

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We start with 10 students at the beginning of the year. Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

Now, let's find the number of additional students by subtracting the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Felix is an expert tree climber who charges kids to retrieve their stuff from trees. He charges $0.25 for every branch he has to climb. During the week, he made a total of $105. Let's calculate how many branches he climbed on average per day.

To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch.

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's calculate the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase.

First, we need to find the total number of petals from each set of flowers. Rose picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 petals. Then, she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each, which gives us 4 * 6 = 24 petals. Next, she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each, resulting in 5 * 4 = 20 petals. Finally, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each, which equals 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

However, Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, so we need to subtract 4 petals from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals.

The final answer is: 97"
"Let's figure out how many S'mores each kid can have. 

First, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean make their S'mores and drop some on the ground. 

John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use 18 marshmallows. They also drop 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21
Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Now, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have.

S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total time played by each person. Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. 

The friend who is better than Jack plays for 1.5 times the time, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played is 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

The total amount of money used is 840 * 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Tanya makes a salt scrub that fills a 10-ounce jar each time.
- She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Then, he gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

So, Joe gives away a total of 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's get to the problem at hand. We have 20 students working together to raise money for a charity. Each student earns the same amount, and the charity raises a total of $175,000. Out of this amount, $50,000 comes from organizations, so the students must have raised the remaining amount.

To find out how much the students raised, we subtract the amount from organizations ($50,000) from the total amount raised ($175,000). This gives us $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"

To find the time she walked on the second day, we need to divide the time she walked on the first day by 2. So, 8 hours / 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we add the time from both days together: 480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes.

To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate his daily earnings first. Since John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks that pay $1.20 each, we can multiply these numbers together.

Daily earnings = 30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle * $1.20/task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Now, to find out how much John makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

Erika has already received $150 from her part-time job and an additional $80 from her mom. So, the total amount of money she has received is $150 + $80 = $230.

Since Erika only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs: $400 + $50 = $450.

To find out how much money Erika had in her purse initially, we subtract the amount she received from the total amount she has: $450 - $230 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

To find out how many apple slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam has. 

First, let's see how many slices come from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, 3 large apples will give us 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

Next, we'll calculate the number of slices from the small apples. Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples will give us 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, let's add the slices from the large and small apples together. 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices in total.

Adam eats 15 slices, so to find out how many are left, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices. 30 - 15 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's talk about the farmer's milk production. He extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each of his cows, and he currently has 3 cows. To find out how many more cows he needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to determine how many cows are required to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

To do this, we can divide the total amount of milk needed (25 liters) by the amount of milk each cow produces (5 liters). 

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to have 5 cows in total.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three glue sticks, and we know the fraction of each that is still usable. 

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 1/6 by 12. 
1/6 * 12 = 2 millimeters

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 2/3 by 12. 
2/3 * 12 = 8 millimeters

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 1/2 by 12. 
1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions together: 
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"Let's break down Gabriel's situation. He wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. To find out how much money he still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080. Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help him, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items:
$10080 - $5200 = $4880

So, Gabriel still needs $4880."
"I'm Yumi, and I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how much change Thea got, we need to subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount she gave the craftsman. 

First, let's calculate the total amount Thea gave the craftsman: 4 * $20 = $80

Now, let's subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount: $80 - $70 = $10

Thea got $10 as change."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate how much money Craig has left after his purchases.

Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is a total of 2 x $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

To find the total amount he spent, we add the cost of squirt guns and water balloons: $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

So, Craig has $19 left."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he must have collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the information given: there are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. Out of these, 5 students are good at math only, and 8 students are good at English only. The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English. Since the students good at both subjects are counted in both groups, we need to add them to the students good at math only.

Let's find the number of students good at both math and English. We can do this by subtracting the students good at math only and English only from the total number of students.
Students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, let's find the total number of students good at math. We add the students good at math only to those good at both math and English.
Total students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Vicki's pop concert planning.

To figure out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time for each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes to perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

After 1 year, Brenda will have: $300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525
After 2 years, Brenda will have: $525 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $750
After 3 years, Brenda will have: $750 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $975

The final answer is: $975"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20. 

To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts: 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. This difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

"Let's calculate how much the farmer will earn from selling the eggs.

First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:

Number of trays = 900 / 30
= 30

Now, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings:

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve the problem together.

Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y.

First, let's find the number of goats left in Farm X. We subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm X. 
Number of goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45

Next, we find the number of goats sold from Farm Y. Since he sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as from Farm X, we multiply the number of goats sold from Farm X by 2. 
Number of goats sold from Farm Y = 10 * 2 = 20

Now, let's find the number of goats left in Farm Y. We subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm Y.
Number of goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y.
Total number of goats left = 45 + 25 = 70

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two types of baskets: green food and red food. The green food basket costs $25, and the red food basket costs $18. We're buying 3 baskets of each.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food: 3 * $25 = $75. Next, we calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food: 3 * $18 = $54. 

Now, we add the costs of both types of baskets together: $75 + $54 = $129. However, we also get a discount of $2 for each basket of red food. Since we bought 3 baskets of red food, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

To find the final cost, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $129 - $6 = $123.

"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to determine the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms in total, we calculate one-half of that.

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Now, we need to find the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Mr. Jackson's fourth-grade class has 27 students, and he wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack.

First, let's find the total number of glue sticks required. We multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks per student: 27 * 2 = 54.

Now, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 / 8 = 6.75.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the initial amount of water passing through a river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons, so we add that to the amount from the second day: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to add the amounts from all three days: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a plague that infects people, and each infected person infects six others every day. We want to find out how many people are infected after three days.

Day 1: 
- Initially, there are 10 people infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new people are infected.
- Total people infected after Day 1: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2: 
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total people infected after Day 2: 70 (previous) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 490.

Day 3: 
- The 360 people infected on Day 2 infect 360 * 6 = 2160 new people.
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total people infected after Day 3: 490 (previous) + 2160 (new) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 3070.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges from the market. She gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. Then, she gave her only boy 3 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges Jennifer gave to her children in total, we add the oranges given to her daughters and her son: 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with. We subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves every hour, and she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. So, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked a total of 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and we need to convert this to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can divide the price per slice by 100 to get the price in dollars: 50 cents / 100 = 0.5 dollars per slice.

Now, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

However, I made a slight mistake in my calculation. Let me redo it. 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can find the number of silver coins by subtracting 30 from the number of gold coins.

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
Number of silver coins = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins.

Total coins = Number of silver coins + Number of gold coins
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the number of leftover burritos from the sixth-grade class picnic.

First, we need to find out how many burritos were eaten in total. There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George, the teacher, also ate 20 burritos. 

To find the total number of burritos eaten, we add the number of burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George: 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos in total, the number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the information given about the bumper car rink. They have 12 red cars. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so the rink has 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. Since they have 10 green cars, they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, let's add up the number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has a total of 75 cars, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We can express the relationship between Sofie and Anne as S = A + 25. We can also express the relationship between Anne and Fawn as A = F - 12.

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25. This simplifies to S = F + 13.

We also know that S + A + F = 85. Substituting the first equation into this equation, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85.

Combine like terms: 2F + A + 13 = 85.

Substituting the second equation into this equation, we get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85.

Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84.

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we need to calculate the total number of Jello cups he needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, the total number of Jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since one box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, the number of boxes needed is 120 / 10 = 12.

The cost of one box of Jello is $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will get $500 in change."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Madeline and her roommate Keenan share the cost of groceries, and they spend about $400 per month together. We're trying to figure out how much Keenan spends per week if Madeline pays 60% of the cost.

First, let's find out how much Keenan pays in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 40% of the cost. To find 40% of $400, we multiply 0.4 by 400.

0.4 x 400 = $160

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so we'll divide the amount Keenan spends in a month by 4.

$160 / 4 = $40

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final answer is: $40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To do this, we multiply 2/5 by 60. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

Next, we know he ate 10 pieces on the second day.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find this out, we multiply 7/13 by 26. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, so to find the cost of 1 bottle of soda, we'll divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle of soda.

Similarly, 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, so to find the cost of 1 bottle of water, we'll divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle of water.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Amy's history test score.

To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 questions, and Amy correctly answers 80% of them. Since each question is worth 1 point, we can multiply the number of questions by the percentage she got right and the point value of each question: 10 questions * 80% * 1 point = 8 points.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. There are 20 questions, and Amy correctly answers 90% of them. Again, we multiply the number of questions by the percentage she got right and the point value of each question: 20 questions * 90% * 1 point = 18 points.

Now, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. There are 5 questions, and Amy correctly answers 60% of them. Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so we multiply the number of questions by the percentage she got right and the point value of each question: 5 questions * 60% * 5 points = 15 points.

Now that we have the points from each type of question, we can add them together to find Amy's total score: 8 points + 18 points + 15 points = 41 points.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens is:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000, so the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, the amount he needs to make from selling the chickens to make a profit of $2000 is $9000. 

However, we are asked for the cost price of the chickens. To find the cost price, we need to subtract the profit from the selling price. 

The selling price is $9000 and the profit is $2000. 

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses of lemonade. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold together by subtracting the number of glasses Julie sold from the total.

Total glasses sold = 32
Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold - Glasses sold by Julie = 32 - 14 = 18

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses each of them sold by dividing the total number of glasses they sold by 2.

Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 18
Number of people selling glasses = 2
Glasses sold by Micah = Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

Now, we can find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 9
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 9 = 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, we can find the cost of one pack of bacon by dividing the total cost by the number of packs: $10 / 5 = $2. Then, the cost of one packet of chicken is 2 * $2 = $4. The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, we need to find the cost of the apples. Since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, and the 3 packs of strawberries cost $12 in total, we can find the cost of one pack of strawberries by dividing the total cost by the number of packs: $12 / 3 = $4. Then, the cost of one pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2. The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we can find the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it includes a 15-minute encore. We know the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as x minutes. The final concert's runtime is 2x minutes, and adding the 15-minute encore gives us 2x + 15 minutes.

Since the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

So, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays. To find the total number of chimichangas made on these two days, we simply add them together.

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) = 250

Now, we're told that they make twice as many chimichangas on Friday as they do on Tuesday and Wednesday combined. Since they make 250 chimichangas on Tuesday and Wednesday, we multiply this number by 2 to find the number of chimichangas made on Friday.

250 (Tuesday and Wednesday) * 2 = 500

Now, to find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday to the number made on Friday.

250 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 500 (Friday) = 750

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the singer has 50 microphones and 20% of them won't find any space to fit in. This means 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs.

To find the number of microphones that will be arranged in pairs, we can calculate 80% of 50. 

80% of 50 = 0.8 * 50 = 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the total number of microphones arranged in pairs by 2.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Ellen is on a diet and she buys the same items every day. She gets two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which means it costs $3. 

Let's figure out how much she pays for one carrot every day. We know that the total cost of her daily goods is $11. We can represent the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Since she buys two carrots, the total cost of the carrots is 2x.

The total cost equation is: 2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x (for Joe's lawn) + 18x (for Kamala's lawn) + 30x (for Alba's lawn) = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

To find y, we need to find the value of x first. Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y. 
54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

The final answer is: $26"

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how much profit John makes on his car, we need to calculate his total earnings from renting it out and then subtract his car payment.

John rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour. 

First, let's calculate his total earnings: 
Number of times rented: 10
Number of hours per rental: 3
Hourly rate: $25

Total earnings = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, let's subtract his car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.
Car payment: $500

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Martha initially had some notebooks, and then she bought 5 more, resulting in a total of 7 notebooks. To find out how many notebooks Martha had initially, we subtract the number of notebooks she bought from the total number of notebooks she now has: 7 - 5 = 2.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha had 2 notebooks initially, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Dijana and Anis went out rowing on a Sunday morning, and Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find the total distance they rowed, we need to calculate Anis's distance first.

1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, let's add Dijana's and Anis's distances together to get the total. 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas and was planning to divide them equally among her 6 nephews. However, her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself before she could package them. 

To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to first determine how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took some. We subtract the number of cookies he took from the total number of cookies. 

100 (total cookies) - 4 (cookies taken by husband) = 96 cookies left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.

"Let's break down the information given. Denise read 10 pages yesterday, and Daniel read 13 pages yesterday. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, we only need to consider his yesterday's reading.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday. Denise read 5 more than that, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

To find out Denise's total pages read, we add her yesterday's and today's reading: 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel: 28 - 13 = 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Calvin's pot can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since there are 4 adults (Calvin, his wife, and 2 children) and 2 children, a total of 6 people will eat dinner.

Each person will eat one bowl, so 6 bowls will be used for dinner. Since the pot can fill 8 child bowls, we can say that 4 adult bowls is equivalent to 4 child bowls. This means that 4 adult bowls were used for dinner, which is equivalent to 4 child bowls.

Now, let's calculate the leftover soup. The pot can fill 8 child bowls, and 4 child bowls were used for dinner. So, there are 8 - 4 = 4 child bowls left.

Since there are 2 children, and each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we can divide the leftover child bowls by the number of children. 4 child bowls / 2 children = 2.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find out how much material Jo needs to make face masks for her class, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, we know that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks. So, the material needed per small mask is 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per mask. To make 20 small masks, Jo will need 20 * 0.5 yards = 10 yards of material.

For large masks, we know that 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks. So, the material needed per large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per mask. To make 8 large masks, Jo will need 8 * 0.75 yards = 6 yards of material.

Now, let's add the material needed for small and large masks together. Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"Let's break down Harold's daily activities. He sleeps for 10 hours a night, which is a good amount of rest. 

Harold also works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

In addition to sleeping and working, Harold walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends on these activities. There are 24 hours in a day.

Total hours spent = 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walk) = 19 hours

Now, let's calculate Harold's free time:
Free time = Total hours in a day - Total hours spent
Free time = 24 - 19

Tim has a box with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. If he uses 3 blue shoeboxes and 1/3 of his red shoeboxes to go fishing, how many red and blue shoe boxes are left in Tim's box?

To find out how many red shoeboxes Tim used, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9.

1/3 of 9 = 9 / 3 = 3

So, Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes to go fishing.

Initially, Tim had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. After using 3 blue and 3 red shoeboxes, he is left with:

Blue shoeboxes: 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoeboxes: 9 - 3 = 6

Therefore, the total number of shoeboxes left is 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: (Duncan's age eight years ago) = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)
So, (60 - 8) = 2x
52 = 2x
x = 26

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam's age four years ago was 26, his current age is 26 + 4 = 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We know that he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna and that there are 20 red balloons.

First, let's calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons: 2 pieces/balloon * 20 balloons = 40 pieces.

Since the total number of bologna pieces is 58, the number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Now, let's find out how many yellow balloons there are. Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can divide the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons by 3: 18 / 3 = 6.

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream for their father's birthday. 

The cake costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since the balloons are sold in sets of 2 for $0.5, we need to find out how many sets of 2 balloons they bought. To do this, we divide 12 by 2, which equals 6. Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set: 6 * $0.5 = $3. 

Next, they bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. The total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items they bought: $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

Since Martha started collecting at 5 years old, and she's now 10, she's been collecting for 5 years. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply 5 years by 12 months to get the total number of months.

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

"I'm Yumi, and I'm happy to help you with Lana's tea problem. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows, and in each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Then, she uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

First, let's find out how many cups of tea are in each row. We can do this by dividing the total number of cups by the number of rows: 27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 / 2 = 4.5. However, since you can't have half a cup of tea, this means that the number of mint tea cups in each row must be 4 or 5.

Let's consider the two possibilities:

If there are 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. But we know that the total number of mint tea cups is 15, so this option is not correct.

If there are 5 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15. This matches the given information, so this option is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We start with 10000 gallons of water in a pool. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Now, let's think about how the water is used. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. We want to find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days.

To do this, we need to find the total amount of water used from the tank in 6 days. Since the tank is emptied at 500 gallons per day, the total amount of water used in 6 days is 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

So, after 6 days, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

The final answer is: 2000"
"Let's break down Colby's expenses for the month. He has a budget of $150. He's already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday.

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

First, we need to find the calories of each type of mini pastry. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, we'll calculate the calories from the blueberry muffins. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Now, let's add the calories from both types of pastries together: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

3. P = Pp + J

We can substitute Pp from equation 2 into equation 1:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P from equation 3 into the equation:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Maria invited 4 of her friends over for a water balloon fight in the backyard. At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. She had one water balloon for herself. Then her mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. Let's count the total number of balloons they have.

First, Maria had 1 balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is 1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15 balloons.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons.

The final answer is: 24"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, a charity group is having a yard sale and they have a lot of stuff to sell. They have 10 people who donated 5 boxes of stuff each, which is a total of 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. They also already had 10 boxes, so they have a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they need 60 / 2 = 30 tables. They already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's calculate the average total distance spat in the watermelon seed spitting contest.

Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, her total distance is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, her total distance is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the total number of seeds: 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

The final answer is: 10.93"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000.

First, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. To do this, we'll multiply the number of widgets each machine can make per hour by the number of hours it runs in a day and then by the number of days in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine. We'll multiply the number of widgets each machine produces by the price of each widget, which is $6.

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

To find the difference in revenue, we'll subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"Let's break down Cameron's hotel stay. He arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay, and 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. However, Cameron can also choose to pay 1000 pesos for the initial 12 hours and an additional 70 pesos for every hour after that.

Since Cameron stays for 17 hours, he needs to pay for 5 additional hours after the initial 12 hours. The cost for these additional hours would be 70 * 5 = 350 pesos.

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the 24-hour option, which is 1600 pesos. To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we need to find out how much hay each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount would be 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. Now, we subtract 3 pounds from 10 pounds to find out how much each sheep needs: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now that we know each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately. For the goats, we have 15 goats, each needing 5 pounds of hay, so the total is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds. For the sheep, we have 12 sheep, each needing 7 pounds of hay, so the total is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"Let's break down John's situation. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked for 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank. This means he has 300 - 50 - 100 = 150 dollars left.

Next, John buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. After buying the pencils, he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

Now, let's see how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money. To do this, we divide the remaining money by the cost of a pen: 100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem. Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. To find the total number of letters in the words he spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters Craig spelled to the total number of letters his brother spelled: 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: 650"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total number of children participating in the drill, we need to calculate the total number of children in one school and then multiply it by the number of schools.

There are 8 children in each row and 7 rows. So, the total number of children in one school is 8 * 7 = 56.

Now, we have 5 different schools, so we multiply the total number of children in one school by the number of schools: 56 * 5 = 280.

The final answer is: 280"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

There are 29 pupils in a class, and the teacher wants to give each student 2 bottles of apple juice for lunch. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.

First, let's find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher needs to give to the students. Since there are 29 pupils and each student gets 2 bottles, the total number of bottles needed is 29 * 2 = 58.

Now, let's calculate how many bottles the teacher gets from her coupons. She has 9 coupons, and each coupon is redeemable for 100 bottles, so she gets 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left, we need to subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she got. 

900 - 58 = 842

The final answer is: 842"
"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the visit fee.

First, let's calculate the labor cost. Since Patty charges $35 per hour, or part thereof, for labor, we multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly rate. In this case, Patty worked 2.25 hours, so the labor cost is 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75.

Next, we add the cost of parts, which is $60, and the visit fee, which is $40.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"Let's break down James' situation. He bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so the original price is 10 * $15 = $150. However, he got them for 40% off, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60. After the discount, he paid $150 - $60 = $90.

James then sold 5 CDs for $40 each, making a total of 5 * $40 = $200. To find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the amount he spent. So, he was out $90 - $200 = -$110. The negative sign indicates a loss.

The final answer is: -$110"
"Let's calculate the total earnings from Jen's root crops. 

First, we need to find out how much she earns from the yams. Since she has 6 yams and each yam can be sold at $1.5, the total earnings from yams are 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we'll calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes. Jen has 10 sweet potatoes, and each sweet potato costs $2. So, the total earnings from sweet potatoes are 10 * $2 = $20.

Lastly, we'll find out how much she earns from the carrots. Jen has 4 carrots, and each carrot costs $1.25. Therefore, the total earnings from carrots are 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

"Let's break down James' journey across the lake. First, we need to find the time it took him to swim 60% of the 20-mile lake. To do this, we'll calculate 60% of 20 miles.

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had.

First, we need to find seven times the number of loaves Sam had. To do this, we multiply 70 by 7: 70 * 7 = 490.

Now, we need to subtract 40 from this result to find the number of loaves the bakery has: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much commission Cayley will earn from selling newspapers.

First, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times. The number of copies sold is 6, the price per copy is $5, and the commission rate is 10%. To find the commission, we multiply the number of copies sold by the price per copy and then multiply by the commission rate, and finally divide by 100.

Commission from New York Times = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
Commission from New York Times = 300 / 100
Commission from New York Times = $3

Next, we need to calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal. The number of copies sold is 10, the price per copy is $15, and the commission rate is 8%. To find the commission, we multiply the number of copies sold by the price per copy and then multiply by the commission rate, and finally divide by 100.

Commission from Wall Street Journal = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
Commission from Wall Street Journal = 1200 / 100
Commission from Wall Street Journal = $12

Now, we add the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal to find the total commission.

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. 

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We can express Bahati's points in terms of Azibo's points as B = A + 20. 

We can also express Bahati's points in terms of Dinar's points as B = D + 10. 

Since both expressions represent Bahati's points, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We can simplify this equation to A = D - 10. 

We also know that the total points scored by the three team members is 45. 

We can express this as B + A + D = 45. 

Substituting B = A + 20 into the equation, we get (A + 20) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45. 

Now, we can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation 2A + D + 20 = 45 to solve for D. 

This gives us 2(D - 10) + D + 20 = 45. 

Simplifying, we get 3D - 20 + 20 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10 to find Azibo's points. 

This gives us A = 15 - 10, which simplifies to A = 5. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, we have 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers to the inch, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

The book is 1.5 inches thick, so the total number of pages in the book is 200 * 1.5 = 300 pages.

"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. Vince stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:
15 * 60 = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 / 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 * 60 = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can find the number of spoons by multiplying the number of cups by 2/3. 

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 spoons.

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of cups and the number of spoons.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

"Hello, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of occupied beds. Since 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we can find this by multiplying 1000 by 1/5.

1/5 of 1000 = 200

This means that 200 beds are occupied. Since 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied, we can find this by multiplying 1000 by 4/5.

4/5 of 1000 = 800

Now, let's calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to multiply 50 by 14 (the number of days in 2 weeks).

50 * 14 = 700

Now, we add the number of occupied beds initially to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

200 + 700 = 900

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

1000 - 900 = 100

"Let's break down Robyn's emails. She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work-related. To find out how many non-work emails she sends, we subtract the work emails from the total: 16 - 7 = 9.

Now, we know that two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family. To find two-thirds of 9, we multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3: (2 * 9) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. So, 6 emails are to her family.

The remaining non-work emails (not to family) are 9 - 6 = 3. Now, we need to find out how many of these emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1 * 3) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, let's find the total number of balls carried by the three boys. We add the number of balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls carried by the boys, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is also 7.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day. On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add the number of corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = 70 + 70 + 85
Total = 225

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three friends, Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe, who are trying to catch Pokémon. Together, they have caught 339 Pokémon.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. We know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so we can write an equation: L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less Pokémon than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write another equation: S = 4A - 13.

Now, let's use the fact that together they have caught 339 Pokémon to write an equation: A + S + L = 339.

Substituting the first equation into the third one, we get: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
This simplifies to: A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Substituting the second equation into the previous one, we get: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
This simplifies to: A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.
Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

"Let's break down the bird's journey to find the distance between her northern and southern homes.

First, the bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. To find the distance traveled in this direction, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Next, the bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this direction is: 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Finally, the bird flies south again for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this direction is: 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, let's consider the bird's overall movement. The bird traveled 300 miles south initially, then 36 miles north, and finally 110 miles south. To find the net distance between the two homes, we need to subtract the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south: 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles.

Net distance = 374 miles

To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we add these amounts together: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Now, let's consider the brownies that were eaten. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were devoured, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total age of Nani's family members.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

To find Nani's sister's age, we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age. Since 25% is the same as 0.25, we multiply Nani's age by 0.25 to find the age difference. Then, we subtract this age difference from Nani's age to find his sister's age.

25% of 8 is 8 * 0.25 = 2 years. So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the time it will take Andy to string all the racquets. 

First, we need to calculate the time for each type of string. For the synthetic gut racquets, it takes 15 minutes per racquet, and there are 3 of them, so the total time is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

Next, for the polyester string racquets, it takes 22 minutes per racquet, and there are 5 of them, so the total time is 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

Lastly, for the hybrid racquets, it takes 18 minutes per racquet, and there are 4 of them, so the total time is 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all the racquets: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"Let's break down the cost of the phones. The first two phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining two phones are half price, so each costs $600 / 2 = $300. The total cost for the remaining two phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

To find the total cost for all four phones, we add the cost of the first two phones to the cost of the remaining two phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Zeke's baseball team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. If Carlton's team has 13 players, we can find the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13. 

13 + 7 = 20

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total number of wooden slats needed for Robert's garden fence, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges at the market. Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, let's find out how many oranges she has left. She had 240 oranges initially and gave away 80, so she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem together.

To find the total number of states in both the USA and India, we need to know the number of states in each country. The USA has 50 states.

Now, let's find the number of states in India. It's mentioned that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25, and 4 more than 25 is 29.

So, India has 29 states.

To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tyler wants to buy a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a children's cookbook that costs $8. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the books. The total cost is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Now, we need to find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn $25. Since he earns $5 per hour, we can find the number of hours by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. To find out how many cherries Richard has, we need to subtract 10 from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Richard and Robert have 20 + 30 = 50 cherries together, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's total from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the information given for Sunny's fundraiser.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. This means he sold 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which is 15 boxes. He also sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: 540"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Pamela is going on a vacation and she needs to pack sunscreen. She reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day. To figure out how many bottles of sunscreen she'll need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she'll use.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she'll reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. She'll be on vacation for 8 days, so she'll reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce. So, she'll use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total. Now, we need to find out how many 8-ounce bottles she'll need.

To do this, we'll divide the total amount of sunscreen she'll use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces). 

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

The price of the blue car is $100. To find 40% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.4. This gives us $40.

Now, we subtract the discount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the prices of the blue and red cars together:
$100 + $60 = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the information given:

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. 

From the information, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil will be 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

From this, we can also deduce that when Emil turns 24, his dad will be twice as old as Emil. So, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Now, we need to find the current age of Emil's dad and brother. Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old (since Emil is 19 now and will turn 24 in 5 years). Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students in Mr. Roper's class are football players. To do this, we'll calculate 20% of 30 students. 
20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students.

Now, we need to find out how many students are not football players. That would be 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band. To do this, we'll calculate 25% of the remaining 24 students. 
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members. 
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to first figure out how many plants she can fit in her flower bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant is 12 inches wide. Pat also needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total space taken up by the plants and the space between them. The total space taken up by the plants is 12 inches (the width of the plant) multiplied by the number of plants. The total space between the plants is 18 inches (the space between each plant) multiplied by the number of plants minus one (since there is one less space between plants than the number of plants).

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 12n - 18(n-1).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 1332 - 12n - 18n + 18 = 1350 - 30n.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1350 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1350. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1350 / 42 = 32.1429. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 32 plants.

However, we need to remember that Pat already owns 17 flowers. So, she needs to buy 32 - 17 = 15 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store, so the total cost will be 15 * 6 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, and his brother eats half as many. To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate half of 18.

Half of 18 is 18 divided by 2, which equals 9.

Now, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7.

9 * 7 = 63

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias. There are 5 baskets, and each basket needs 3 petunias. The cost of each petunia is $3.00. So, the total cost of petunias is 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines. There are 5 baskets, and each basket needs 2 vines. The cost of each vine is $2.50. So, the total cost of sweet potato vines is 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00.

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together to find the total cost. $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Artemis and her father have a 30-pound bag of soil. They plan to plant sunflowers, carnations, and roses. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations. They're planting 4 sunflowers, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. So, the total soil needed for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, they're planting 10 carnations, and each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. So, the total soil needed for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, let's add the soil needed for sunflowers and carnations: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil in total, the amount of soil left for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 roses.

"Hi there, let's break down Jessica's situation. She makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. To find out how much she saves each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she saves $500.00 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year to find the total savings in a year: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we need to divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. To find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both tasks simultaneously.

First, let's calculate how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Next, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the second time, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet and then use that information to determine Bill's age at the time of the second sighting.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 

Three times the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is 3 * 30 = 90 years old. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. 

So, Bill's dad was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when Bill was born. 

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, Bill was 30 - 15 = 15 years old when his dad was born.

Now, let's find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. We know that 75 years passed between the two sightings, and Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet. 

To find Bill's age at the first sighting, we need to subtract 75 years from the age at which Bill saw the comet for the second time. However, we don't know Bill's age at the second sighting yet. We know that Bill was three times his dad's age at the first sighting, which is 30 years old. 

So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when his dad was 30 years old. 

Since 75 years passed between the two sightings, we can subtract 75 from 90 to find Bill's age at the first sighting: 90 - 75 = 15.

He also writes a check every month for his gas bill, adding another 12 checks per year. Additionally, he writes two checks to the church every month, resulting in 24 checks per year. Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service every quarter, which translates to 4 checks per year.

To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to add these numbers together: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

"Let's break down the information given. We know that the first plane makes a total of x flights per day. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the total number of flights made by the first plane by multiplying 44 by 2. This gives us 88 flights.

Now, let's consider the destinations of the first plane. It goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. To find the number of flights to Greece, we multiply 88 by 3/4, which equals 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we subtract the number of flights to Greece from the total number of flights and divide the result by 2.

So, the number of flights to France is (88 - 66) / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's talk about Adam's new trousers. He bought them for $30. His mom gave him $6 to help out, and his dad gave him twice as much as his mom. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mom gave him $6. His dad gave him twice as much as his mom, so his dad gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, let's subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings to buy the trousers.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have four children: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old.

First, let's find the total age of Akbar and Alessandro. 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age = 3 + 4 = 7

Since the total age of the children is 20, we can express the equation as:
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20

We also know that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4)

Now, let's simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
7 + (7 + W) + W = 20
14 + 2W = 20
2W = 6
W = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"

The total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

However, Walter's lawyer will only consider the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, not the $200 donated by his friend. So, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 is still $2000.

To find out how much the lawyer will contribute, we multiply $2000 by 3.

$2000 * 3 = $6000

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

Next, the bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we multiply the total number of cookies by 1/2. 

Cookies given to the church = 1500 * 1/2
= 750

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a family of 6, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids. They want to divide a watermelon in such a way that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

To simplify the problem, let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. If each kid gets x units, then each adult gets 2x units, since they get twice as much as each kid.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each). The total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combine like terms: 6x = 100.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

So, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes
Convert total time from minutes to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the steps to make the cake and calculate the latest time Jordan can start making it.

First, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Jordan needs 3 hours to make the cake. To be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm, she should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem. Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars door to door. Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, and Peter sold four and a half boxes. They sold 64 chocolate bars together.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total earnings per month are $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Peter and Martha have the same number of chocolate bars in each box, but the total number of chocolate bars they have is different.

To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the population of porcupines in the park after a year.

First, we need to find the number of female porcupines. Since the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. With 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

Now, let's add the initial population and the number of babies born to find the total number of porcupines after a year.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, my friends and I were playing pick-up sticks, and we counted the sticks. We have 9 red sticks. We also have 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, which means we have 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks. 

Now, let's find out how many yellow sticks we have. We know the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so we subtract 3 from 14, which gives us 11 yellow sticks.

To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how many miles each person traveled. To do that, we'll multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's speed is 55 miles per hour, and he traveled for 4 hours. So, his distance is 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

Shandy's speed is 45 miles per hour, and she traveled for 10 hours. So, her distance is 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. The difference is 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Brook Hills High School has a total of 3000 students. 

First, we find the number of students over 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16, we divide 3000 by 2, which gives us 1500 students over 16.

Next, we need to find the number of male students over 16. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 are male, we divide 1500 by 4, which gives us 375 male students over 16.

Now, we can find the number of female students over 16 by subtracting the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16. So, 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.

Moving on, we find the number of students under 16. Since the remaining half of the students are under 16, we also have 1500 students under 16.

Next, we need to find the number of male students under 16. Since one-half of the students under 16 are male, we divide 1500 by 2, which gives us 750 male students under 16.

Now, we can find the number of female students under 16 by subtracting the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16. So, 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.

Finally, we can find the total number of female students by adding the number of female students over 16 and the number of female students under 16. So, 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"Let's break down the information given about the people running laps on the track.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps. 

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, which means she can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped into the tank on the first day. Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Since Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Maria's power bank was losing 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours. After that, it started losing 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. We're given that the final charge remaining is 28%.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

For the next 3 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%. However, we know that the final charge remaining is 28%, so the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

Now, let's find the charge remaining after 8 hours. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 6%, so the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34% - 6% = 28%. This means that the charge remaining after 8 hours is indeed 28%.

To find the initial charge, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the first 5 hours. The charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%, so the charge lost in the first 5 hours is 100% - 55% = 45%.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Janet just got a job as a waitress, and she's trying to save up for a down payment on a car. She makes $10 an hour from her wages and $15 an hour from tips, which means her total hourly earnings are $25.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. To find out how much she needs to save, we multiply the cost of the car by 20% (or 0.2). So, 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, let's calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up for the down payment."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruits. He's already bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, 4 pears at $0.5 each, 2 kiwis at $1 each, and 5 apples at $0.75 each.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Now, let's see how many plums he can buy with the remaining money. Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's solve this problem together. 

Anne bought a box of sweets that contains 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. She kept two packs for herself and gave the rest to her 10 friends equally. 

First, we need to find out how many packs she gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, we need to divide the packs she gave away (13) by the number of friends (10) to find out how many packs each friend received. 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are in 0.3 packs. To do this, we multiply 0.3 by 60.

0.3 * 60 = 18 pieces

Now, we add the pieces in 1 pack (60) and the pieces in 0.3 packs (18) to find out how many pieces each friend received.

60 + 18 = 78

So, each friend received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. 

To find the number of pictures in each album, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Since 3 albums were selfies only, the number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums = 5 albums. 
The number of portraits is 5 albums * 9 pictures per album = 45 portraits.

However, we were also told that 2 of the albums were portraits. This means that the 5 albums of portraits include the 2 portrait albums, and the remaining 3 albums are also portraits. So, the correct number of portraits is 2 albums * 9 pictures per album + 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits + 27 portraits = 45 portraits.

The total number of portraits and selfies is 27 selfies + 45 portraits = 72.

However, the question asks for portraits and selfies, not the total. So, the correct answer is 45 portraits and 27 selfies.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

James reads 18 pages in total. Since he reads 3 pages per set, we divide 18 by 3 to find the number of sets: 18 / 3 = 6 sets.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we multiply the number of sets by the time per set: 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the situation at the hotel. Initially, there were 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, so we subtract those from the initial number: 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so we subtract those from the remaining number: 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. We add these new guests to the remaining number: 61 + 30 = 91.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so we add those to the total: 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many bananas John has.

John picked 4 bananas on Wednesday. Then he picked 6 bananas on Thursday. On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, John picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, John picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas he picked on each day: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

The final answer is: 22"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are in the quiz. Since there are 60 questions in total, we can start by finding 40% of 60, which represents the number of easy questions.

40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24

So, there are 24 easy questions. The remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so we can find the number of average and difficult questions by dividing the remaining questions by 2.

Remaining questions = 60 - 24 = 36
Average questions = 36 / 2 = 18
Difficult questions = 36 / 2 = 18

Now, let's find out how many of each type of question Aries is sure to get. She is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18. She is also sure to get 50% of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 for each.

So, Aries is sure to get 18 easy questions, 9 average questions, and 9 difficult questions.

To find the total number of questions Aries is sure to get, we can add these numbers together:

18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Since x = 2y, we can substitute this into the equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's calculate the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. To find the total number of sandwiches they eat per day, we add these amounts together: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total number of sandwiches they eat per day by 7: 11 * 7 = 77 sandwiches.

The final answer is: 77"
"Let's break down Suzanne's earnings. She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80. 

Next, she sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we need to subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since there are two Smith twins, and each found 30 eggs, we multiply 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60

Now, we know that 10 eggs were left unfound. To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we subtract the total eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. He can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

Now, let's calculate how much more ore he can mine with a steel pickaxe compared to an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Next, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month, which has 30 days. We multiply 1440 by 30 to get the total amount of ore mined in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three different package sizes for sandwiches: 2 sandwiches for $3, 4 sandwiches for $6, and 8 sandwiches with an unknown price.

First, we need to find the price per sandwich for the first two packages. For the first package, the price per sandwich is $3 divided by 2 sandwiches, which equals $1.5 per sandwich. 

For the second package, the price per sandwich is $6 divided by 4 sandwiches, which also equals $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. Now, we can find the price for the third package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the bedroom set. This means he still owes $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how much Tom has to pay per month. The interest rate is 10% per month, which is equivalent to 0.10. To calculate the monthly payment, we multiply the amount still owed by the interest rate:

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sally initially had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. To find the number of red balloons that burst, we multiply 25 by 0.4: 25 * 0.4 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons Sally has: 15 red balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 34.

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

To find the probability of having to turn in his homework, we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100%.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Apple High School is having their graduation ceremony at the Fine Arts Center, which can accommodate 6000 people. They've reserved 950 seats for the graduates and 300 seats for the faculty. To find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats = 950 (for graduates) + 300 (for faculty) = 1250
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 1250
Available seats = 4750

Now, let's divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

So, each graduate can give 5 tickets to their friends and family."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's talk about Grandpa's jelly bean eating habits. It's interesting to know that the number of jelly beans he can eat depends on their size. 

We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, let's figure out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can set up a proportion to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans.

Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Then, 3x = 150 (since 3 small beans = 1 medium-sized bean). 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

The final answer is: 50"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Melissa's jury pay calculation. 

To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Total earnings: 3 days * $15 per day = $45
Total expenses: 3 days * $3 per day = $9

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Next, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total: 
Total hours = 6 hours per day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses:
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Richard wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet along his 24-foot-wide driveway. To find the total number of bottles, we need to divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Uncle Franky ordered two boxes of apples, and each box has 40 apples. To find out how many apples he has in total, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box: 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Now, he wants to pack the apples with 8 apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 80 / 8 = 10.

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's calculate the total cost of the cheese Amor bought. The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so that's 2 * $11 = $22. The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so that's 3 * $6 = $18. 

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40. Since Amor starts with $50, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money to find out how much she has left. $50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"Let's break down Jim's situation. He took 4 years to finish college, during which he borrowed $50,000 per year. This adds up to a total of 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000 in loans.

Additionally, he lost income from not working during those 4 years. His pre-college income was $25,000 per year, so the total lost income is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

The total amount Jim needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

After graduating, Jim's income triples to $75,000 per year. To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width, so the area of one piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many letters the post office delivered on each day. On Monday, they delivered 425 letters.

Next, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. To find one-fifth of 425, we divide 425 by 5, which is 85. Then, we add 17 to that result, which gives us 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

Now, let's move on to Wednesday. They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. To find twice as many as Tuesday, we multiply 102 by 2, which is 204. Then, we add 5 to that result, which gives us 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Johnny's dad went to watch some horse racing and placed some bets. Let's break down the losses and wins for each race.

In the first race, he lost $5. 

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

Since there were 3 races, we need to find the average loss. To do this, we divide the total loss by the number of races: -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

Now, let's find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height
Difference = 52 inches - 51 inches
Difference = 1 inch

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three people who divided an amount of $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first, and the third person took twice what the second took.

Let's denote the share of the first person as x. The second person's share would then be x + 80, and the third person's share would be 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combining like terms, we get: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Simplifying further, we get: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtracting 240 from both sides, we get: 4x = 1680.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 420.

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car is $20,000, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * depreciation rate)
= $12,472 - ($12,472 * 0.21)
= $12,472 - $2,620.32

Next, 10% of the books are written in German. To find 10% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.1, which equals 5 books.

Now, we know that 25 books are in English and 5 books are in German. To find the total number of books written in English and German, we add these two numbers together: 25 + 5 = 30.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you calculate the cost of renovating your kitchen floor.

To find the total cost, we need to determine the number of tiles required to cover the floor. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Given that the total area of your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can find the total number of tiles needed by dividing the total area by the area of a single tile: 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile, which is $12. So, the total cost is 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

"Let's break down Greg's laundry needs. He puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 

For the twin beds, he needs 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets. 
For the king size bed, he needs 1 king sheet.

So, in total, he needs 8 + 1 = 9 sheets per week.

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, let's find out how many sets he can wash in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

To find out how many movies they watch in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch on Sunday. Since they watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, they watch 4 / 2 = 2 movies on Sunday.

In one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

Now, if they watch movies every weekend for 4 weeks, we can multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4. So, 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each time. To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food each cat eats per day and then divide the total amount of cat food by that amount.

Each cat eats 60 grams of cat food twice a day, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 grams per cat per day.

Now, let's multiply the amount each cat eats per day by the number of cats: 120 grams * 3 cats = 360 grams per day.

To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount each cat eats per day (360 grams): 720 / 360 = 2.

So, the cat food will last for 2 days.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes.

Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Then, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

First, there's the cost of the cast, which is $200. 

Next, we have the cost of the doctor's visit. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit lasted for 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Then, there are the painkillers. Hannah needs 30 painkillers at $4 each, so the total cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Finally, there's the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and there are 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of coupon. The cost per small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents. The cost per big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

First, we need to find the number of trucks that had mechanical failures. A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, so we calculate this by multiplying the total number of trucks by 1/4.

Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4)
= 20 * 0.25
= 5

Now, we need to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers. This is the total number of trucks minus the number of trucks with mechanical failures.

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5
= 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons per truck.

Total tons of fertiliser = 15 * 20
= 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

Since Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he needs 6 pounds of butter. 

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, so for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays the full price of $4.00 for one pound and half off for the other pound. 

For 6 pounds of butter, he will need to buy 3 sets of 2 pounds. 

The cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter is:
- 3 sets * $4.00 (full price) = $12.00
- 3 sets * $2.00 (half off) = $6.00
- Total cost for 6 pounds of butter = $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total cost of Kayla's party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and multiply it by the cost per guest, then add the initial fee.

First, let's find the total number of guests attending the party. Kayla invited her 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. However, 4 people said they couldn't come. So, the total number of guests attending is 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. The number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

Now, we can calculate the cost for the additional guests. The cost per guest is $6, so the total cost for the additional guests is 21 * 6 = $126.

Finally, we add the initial fee of $125 to the cost for the additional guests to get the total cost of the party. The total cost is $126 + $125 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending some of their money, we can assume that the amount they spent is the same for both of them.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Maggie had as M and the initial amount of money Riza had as R. We know that M = R = $60.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. So, the amount of money Maggie has left is 3/4 * M = 3/4 * $60 = $45.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. So, the amount of money Riza has left is 2/3 * R = 2/3 * $60 = $40.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have: $45 + $40 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for his three monkeys, which will last them for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many bananas they eat each day by dividing 315 by 7.

315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day

Now, let's consider the eating habits of the monkeys. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten each day. 

45 (total bananas per day) - 10 (first monkey) - 14 (second monkey) = 45 - 24 = 21 bananas

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's break down the problem. Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 pieces. To find the total number of pieces he placed, we add these two numbers together: 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Jenny went to the florist to buy some flowers. Roses cost $2 each and $15 for a dozen. She bought 15 roses and had five $5 bills. The florist only has quarters for change.

Let's break it down. Since Jenny bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen. 15 roses is 1 and 3 roses. 1 dozen is 12 roses, so she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses.

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's calculate the total amount of money Terry makes from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas.

First, we need to find the total amount from each item. 
6 milkshakes for $5.50 each will be 6 x $5.50 = $33
9 burger platters for $11 each will be 9 x $11 = $99
20 sodas for $1.50 each will be 20 x $1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the total amount from each item together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how long Paul will wait for his train.

The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes, and it will stay in the station for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Melanie found a blueprint for a toothpick sculpture that requires 200 toothpicks. She's been saving toothpicks from her mom's sandwiches, and she's been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to calculate how many toothpicks she has saved so far.

She saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so the total number of toothpicks she saved is 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, and she already has 120, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs: 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week: 80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of the original price, we multiply the original price by 0.75:
2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Next, we need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. He sold it at 120% of the price he bought it, so we multiply the price he bought it for by 1.2:
1500 * 1.2 = $1800

Now, we need to find the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. This is the difference between the original price and the price he paid:
2000 - 1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
(200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how many jellyfish 5 springs create in 4 hours.

First, we need to convert 4 hours into seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame.

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Now, we know that each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second. Since there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

To find the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

So, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72000."
"Let's figure out Frankie's bowling score. We know Binkie's score is 90. To find Frankie's score, we need to calculate twice Binkie's score first.

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we need to add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score. 

Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"Let's break down James' journey. He walked to the store, which is 4 miles away, and then he walked back home. Since he walked halfway to the store before turning back, he walked a total of 4 miles to the halfway point and 4 miles back home, making it a total of 8 miles.

To find the time it took him to walk 8 miles, we need to divide the total distance by his speed. James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. 

8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many bananas Jenny bought in total. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, we multiply the number of bunches by the number of bananas per bunch: 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 bananas individually. The price per banana is $0.80, so we multiply the total number of bananas by the price per banana: 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, we need to find the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, we multiply the number of bunches by the price per bunch: 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence between them. They decide to split it, with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam. 

Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine its growth rate per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years.

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month.

First, we need to find the number of each type of bike sold. We know that Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, which is 300 / 2 = 150. 

Next, 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15, which gives us 45 BMX bikes.

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since we already know the number of Trekking and BMX bikes, we can subtract these from the total number of bikes to find the number of MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105.

Now that we know the number of each type of bike sold, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike. The price of a Trekking bike is $450, so 150 * $450 = $67,500. The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500 / 2 = $250. So, 45 * $250 = $11,250. The price of an MTB is $500, so 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The farmer is making 5 bales of hay per hour, and the truck is picking up 3 bales per hour. They both work for 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer. Since the farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, the total number of bales made is 5 * 6 = 30.

Next, let's calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck. The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales picked up is 3 * 6 = 18.

Now, to find the number of bales left in the field, we need to subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find out how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and the extra time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total minutes John spends in class. He has 6 periods a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, we multiply the minutes per day by the number of days: 
6 periods * 40 minutes per period = 240 minutes per day
240 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1200 minutes per week

John also has 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, which he attends for 5 days a week. 
2 classes * 40 minutes per class = 80 minutes per day
80 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 400 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes: 
1200 minutes per week + 400 minutes per week = 1600 minutes per week

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 
First, let's find the total minutes in a week: 
7 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 1680 minutes per week
1/16 * 1680 minutes per week = 105 minutes per day
105 minutes per day * 2 days = 210 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes, and the extra minutes for Saturday and Sunday: 
1600 minutes per week + 210 minutes per week = 1810 minutes per week

Finally, let's convert the total minutes to hours: 
1810 minutes per week / 60 minutes per hour = 30.17 hours per week

The final answer is: 30.17"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Nathan has a bouncy ball that bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. If he drops it from the third-floor balcony in the mall, where each story is 24 feet high, let's calculate the height of the ball on its second bounce.

First, we need to find the initial height of the ball. Since it's dropped from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

Now, let's calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce. The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height, so it will be 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

Finally, we need to find the height of the ball after the second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its previous height, so it will be 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

To find the height of the fourth child, we need to convert the height of the first child to inches and then calculate the height of each child step by step.

First, we know the first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's get to the problem at hand. An apple orchard sells apples in bags of 10, and they sold a total of 2000 apples one day. To find out how much they earned, we need to figure out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"Let's solve this puzzle together. We know that a group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. 

Since the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what the velociraptors had, we can calculate the velociraptors' share. To do this, we multiply 270 by 2, which gives us 540 kilograms.

Now, we know that the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. So, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. To find the T-Rex's share, we multiply 540 by 2, which gives us 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 multiplied by 2, which equals 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you calculate the cost of painting the room.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the walls first. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons. Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's break down the situation. Ellen initially had 12 sodas, and she shook 3 of them. Then, she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas. Her brother came by and took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, which means there's 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas left.

Now, Ellen's friend is about to choose a soda. There's 1 shaken can out of a total of 7 cans. To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 14.29%."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two trains traveling in opposite directions. One train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the other is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the distance each train has traveled after 3 hours, we multiply their speeds by the time. The first train has traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles. The second train has traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them. So, 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, multiply the number of days Billy helps by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he helps: 
40 * 6 = 240

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present. However, the question doesn't provide the total number of people present, so we'll assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since we're assuming the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported, the number of people inside the church is also 480.

Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we can add 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.
The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so we can calculate Micah's miles by multiplying 8 by 3.5.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"Let's break down Sheila's credit card transactions step by step.

First, Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. Then, she returned one item that cost $15.00. This means we need to subtract the cost of the returned item from the initial charge.

Initial charge: $85.00
Return: -$15.00
New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. We calculate the discount in the same way.

Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the new balance.

Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

Finally, we add the new purchases to the previous balance to find the new balance on Sheila's credit card.

New balance: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's dive into the problem. We have a jellyfish tank with an unknown number of jellyfish. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris. To find Ben's age, we can multiply Chris's age by 2:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's break down Lauren's retirement savings plan. She's saving 20% of her $100,000 annual salary, which is $20,000 per year. In retirement, she plans to live on 40% of her current salary, which is $40,000 per year. Since she wants to live for 20 years in retirement, she needs to save a total of $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

To find out how many years it will take her to save this amount, we divide the total savings needed by her annual savings: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into, and then divide that result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into.

First, divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, divide the result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can find the total number of students by dividing the number of boys by the decimal equivalent of 40%.

40% as a decimal is 0.4. 

Now, let's divide the number of boys by this decimal: 240 / 0.4 = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you figure out how much your mom spent at the gardening shop.

To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the coupon discount.

The cost of the pots is $19, and the cost of the garden soil is $26. Let's add those together: $19 + $26 = $45.

Now, we need to subtract the discount of $7 from the total. $45 - $7 = $38.

So, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and divide it by the total number of women.

There are 3 women wearing 4 inch heels and 3 women wearing 2 inch heels. 

The total height of the 4 inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2 inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The total number of women is 3 + 3 = 6.

The average height of heels is the total height divided by the total number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"Soledad is planning a hiking trip in June and wants to cover 9,300 miles. She plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June, which is 30.

If Soledad hikes 250 miles per day (125 miles twice a day), we can find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles by dividing the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's calculate the total revenue the store will receive after selling all the balls.

There are 3 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 25 green balls in the store. The prices of these balls are $9, $5, and $3 respectively.

To find the total revenue, we need to multiply the number of each type of ball by its price and then add the results together.

Red balls: 3 balls * $9 per ball = $27
Blue balls: 11 balls * $5 per ball = $55
Green balls: 25 balls * $3 per ball = $75

Now, let's add the revenues together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will receive a total of $157 after selling all the balls."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. We need to find out how many kilograms Jacques will have left after Pierre and Paul take their share.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 
Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Now, to find out how much Jacques will have left, we subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount: 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to consider the changes in temperature. The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight, so we subtract that from the initial temperature. Then, it increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning, so we add that to the result.

Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature - Temperature drop + Temperature increase
= 2 - 8 + 3
= -3

The final answer is: $\boxed{-3}$"
"Let's break down Raymond's money situation. He initially had $21. Then, he saved $11 from his allowance, bringing his total to $21 + $11 = $32.

Next, he spent $5 on a comic book, which leaves him with $32 - $5 = $27.

Finally, he spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Anna is trying to buy books for her local library. She had a budget of $16 and has already spent $4. She bought 2 books today, and both books cost the same amount of money. If Anna has $2 left in her budget, let's figure out how much each book cost.

First, we need to find out how much money Anna spent on the books. She had a budget of $16 and spent $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. After buying the 2 books, she had $2 left, so she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

The final answer is: $5"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

The previous year's enrollment was 50 students. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 0.20 by 50, which equals 10 students.

Now, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60 students.

The number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we need to determine the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

"Let's break down the information given. Tate initially has 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. He then buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies. The initial number of male guppies is 4, and he buys 2 more, so the total number of male guppies is 4 + 2 = 6. The initial number of female guppies is 7, and he buys 1 more, so the total number of female guppies is 7 + 1 = 8.

Next, let's calculate the total number of male and female goldfishes. The initial number of male goldfishes is 3, and he buys 2 more, so the total number of male goldfishes is 3 + 2 = 5. The initial number of female goldfishes is 5, and he buys 3 more, so the total number of female goldfishes is 5 + 3 = 8.

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes. The total number of male fishes is 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11. The total number of female fishes is 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16.

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes: 16 - 11 = 5.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's break down John's monthly driving distance to visit his parents. He makes two trips a month, and each trip takes 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.

To find the total distance for a round trip, we need to calculate the one-way distance first. We can do this by multiplying the speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Now, since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. To find out how far she will walk in 7 days, we multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days: 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we need to find half of the distance Sofie walks. To do this, we divide the total distance Sofie walks by 2: 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour. 

First, let's find the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 10 hours. The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. The other 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. So, the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour. 

Now, let's multiply this by 10 hours to find the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 10 hours: 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. This means the fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys, which is 420 - 200 = 220 toys.

Now, let's find out how many toys the fifth worker produced per hour. Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, we can divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker (220) by the number of hours worked (10) to get the number of toys produced per hour: 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 22"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we can find its weight by dividing 60 by 4. 

60 / 4 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we can find its weight by dividing 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30 pounds

Now, we need to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs by adding the weights of both dogs together.

15 + 30 = 45 pounds

Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, we can find the total weight of all the dogs by adding the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs.

45 + 60 = 105 pounds

The final answer is: 105"

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, John wants to know how many small bags of M&M's he can make. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. If an ounce of M&M's contains 30 M&M's, and he puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, let's calculate the total number of small bags he can make.

First, we need to find the total number of M&M's. We multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

"Let's calculate how many days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. To find half of this distance, we divide the circumference by 2.

40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

The final answer is: 50"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'm excited to help you with your question about the fastest car ever made. 

To find the speed of the faster car, we need to start with the average car's speed, which is 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we multiply 120 by 5 to get the 2nd fastest car's speed: 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the faster car's speed, we multiply the 2nd fastest car's speed by 1.25: 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

So, the faster car can go 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"Let's figure out how old Vince is now.

Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam's age was 14 years old. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice the age of Vince, we can calculate Vince's age two years ago by dividing Liam's age two years ago by 2. 

Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so we can represent the number of eggs they painted as A. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. We can represent the number of eggs Sarah painted as S, so Camden painted S + 12 eggs.

Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation S + (S + 12) = 30.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, we can find the number of eggs Camden painted by adding 12 to S, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them into boxes. Each box can hold 8 crayons, so we need to find out how many boxes he'll need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of it, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, we divide 64 by 4 to find the number of logs, as each log is 4 feet.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"

3. Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so their mother earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.
5. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

"Let's break down Grandma's walking routine. She walks 3 miles every day, with 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.

Let's assume her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The time spent on the beach can be calculated as distance/speed = 2/x. This is equal to 40 minutes. So, 2/x = 40.

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Jane has been saving $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks. To find out how many more weeks it will take for her to have saved a total of $60, we need to calculate how much she has saved so far and then determine how much more she needs to save.

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is $4 * 8 = $32.

Now, let's find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve the problem together.

So, Bob has a certain number of marbles. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, Bob will have 60 + 24 = 84 marbles after receiving 2 dozen more marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles. Let's call the number of marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles 'x'. Then, x + 24 = 84. To find 'x', we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 84 - 24 = 60.

Now that we know Bob has 60 marbles before receiving 2 dozen more marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 60: 60 - 10 = 50.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water, one of which is 33 degrees. 

When he pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other bottle into his water bottle, he's able to drink the water. This means the temperature of the water in the bottle after the transfer must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. The total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle).

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40.

Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 / 2 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 >= 80
165 + 5x >= 80
5x >= 80 - 165
5x >= -85
x >= -85 / 5
x >= -17

However, the temperature of the water cannot be negative, so we need to find the minimum value of x that satisfies the condition. Since x cannot be negative, the minimum value of x is 40 degrees.

"Let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how much each single bagel will cost after Russell orders 4 packs, we need to calculate the total cost of the bagels and then divide that by the total number of bagels.

Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in it. So, the total cost of 4 packs is:
$10.00 * 4 = $40.00

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the total cost.
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00
Discounted cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, let's find the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
Number of bagels in one pack = 9
Total number of bagels in 4 packs = 4 * 9 = 36

To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels.
Cost of each single bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

The final answer is: $1.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. It's given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. It's given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. Let's first find out how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

Now, we know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops. To find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops, we need to find out how many groups of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops. 18 / 2 = 9. 

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, it takes 3 * 9 = 27 potatoes to make 18 scoops.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down Chester's egg consumption. He eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, which is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs. Then, he increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days, which is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. To find the number of red jellybeans, we multiply the number of green jellybeans by 2: 17 * 2 = 34.

Now, we add the number of green jellybeans and red jellybeans to find the total number of green and red jellybeans: 17 + 34 = 51.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade.

To find the total number of lemons, we need to know how many lemons he collects from each tree in a year and how many trees he has. We're told that he collects 6 lemons from each tree and he has 5 trees.

So, let's calculate the total number of lemons he gets in a year:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, let's multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10 to find the total number of lemons in a decade:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how many women remained on the bus, we need to first determine the total number of women on the bus. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. 

The total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. The fraction of women in the ratio is 9/14. 

To find the number of women on the bus, we multiply the fraction of women by the total number of passengers: (9/14) * 84 = 54.

Now, we subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquet per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to get the number of bouquets sold per day.

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 12 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets.

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Next, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold per day from the individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from the sunflowers per day, we can divide $26 by $2 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day.

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can add the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

The final answer is: 291"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam has $100 to invest in his rock stand. He buys rocks for $5 each and sells them for $7 each. To find out how much money he loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * $5 = $100

However, Adam only sells 12 rocks, so he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 + $40 = $140

Since Adam only made $84 from selling the rocks, we subtract the revenue from the total cost to find out how much money he loses:

$140 - $84 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Lauren's cartooning project.

To determine how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum of these values.

For large-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 5 scenes per day. To find the number of days it will take her to complete 45 large-sized scenes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days.

For medium-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 6 scenes per day. To find the number of days it will take her to complete 36 medium-sized scenes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days.

For small-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 7 scenes per day. To find the number of days it will take her to complete 49 small-sized scenes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days.

Now, let's compare the number of days it will take Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. The maximum of these values is 9 days, so it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Chatty prepared three dozen eggs for her four children's Easter activity. To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

A dozen is equal to 12, so Chatty prepared 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

There are 4 children. 

To find the number of eggs each child receives, we divide 36 eggs by 4 children.

36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve the problem together.

Patricia initially had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother. To find out how many roses she has left, we need to subtract the roses she gave away from the initial number of roses.

30 (initial roses) - 24 (roses given away) = 6

Then, Patricia bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we need to add the roses she bought to the remaining roses.

6 (remaining roses) + 15 (roses bought) = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two lottery tickets, and we want to find the probability that both of them are winners.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply their individual probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

We have three friends - Carlos, Jim, and Carrey - who went to the beach and collected seashells. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.

Let's start by figuring out how many seashells Carlos collected. If Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, and Jim collected 27 seashells, then we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27. That's 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Now, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let's call the number of seashells Carrey collected ""R"". Since Carlos collected 22 seashells, we can write the equation 2R = 22. To find out how many seashells Carrey collected, we need to solve for R. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us R = 11.

So, we have the following number of seashells collected by each person: Jim (27), Carlos (22), and Carrey (11).

Now, let's find out how many seashells each person gets when they divide the total number of seashells equally among themselves. The total number of seashells is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60. To find out how many seashells each person gets, we divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people): 60 / 3 = 20.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's talk about John's cassette. He has a cassette with 2 songs. The first song is 5 minutes long, and the second song is 60% longer than the first one.

To find the length of the second song, I need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes. To do that, I'll multiply 5 by 0.6 (since 60% is the same as 0.6 as a decimal).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, I'll add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, I have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes and 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, I'll add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Linus bought a mobile device for $20 and sold it for twice the amount of the original price, which is $40. 

If he bought 2 devices last Monday, the total cost price for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. The total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

If he bought 4 devices last Tuesday, the total cost price for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. The total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

To find the total profit, we add the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of Carl's cane, we can divide his height by 2.

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Carla has 8 identical octuplets. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. 

First, let's find the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6. Then, the number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing purple and bows. Since 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, we have 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies wearing purple and bows.

Next, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. We already know 2 babies wearing blue also wear bows. So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple: (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%.

So, the correct answer is 50%."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Abraham owns 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of the land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many eggs each person found. Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of apartments. The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life.

First, we know that a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits. 

A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.

A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.

A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.

A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can find the production of a 10-year-old tree: x = 1000. 

So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three ropes: red, blue, and yellow. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. We know that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can start by substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, which gives us 4B + B + Y = 37. Simplifying this, we get 5B + Y = 37.

Next, we can substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, which gives us 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37. Expanding this, we get 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combining like terms, we get 6Y - 35 = 37. Adding 35 to both sides, we get 6Y = 72.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find that Y = 12. Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives us B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives us R = 4 * 5 = 20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. If Ronnie was given $5, then Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.
(15 - x) = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

"Let's break down the information given about the wall mural. There are four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. We know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Tom has 4 bedrooms in his house, and each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet. To find the total area of the bedrooms, we multiply the length and width of one bedroom: 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, we multiply this by 4 to get the total area of the bedrooms: 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

Next, we're told that the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. So, we multiply the area of one bedroom by 5 to find the area of the living room: 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

We're also given that the rest of the house has an area of 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add up the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"Let's calculate how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 45% of it on Monday. To find the remaining chalk, we need to calculate 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a class with 12 boys and 12 girls, making a total of 24 students.

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so we need to find one-third of 12. To do this, we can multiply 12 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 12 by 3. 12 divided by 3 is 4, so there are 4 girls on varsity.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so we need to find one-fourth of 12. To do this, we can multiply 12 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 12 by 4. 12 divided by 4 is 3, so there are 3 boys on varsity.

Now, let's add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity. 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students. The total number of students is 24, and the number of students on varsity is 7. So, 24 - 7 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"Let's figure out how many face masks Johnny bought. 

First, we need to know how many face masks Mike bought. It's given that Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Now, we're told that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to calculate three times the amount Mike bought and then add 2.

Three times the amount Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15.
Johnny bought 2 more than that, so Johnny bought 15 + 2 = 17 face masks.

The final answer is: 17"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, let's talk about James and his teeth. He has 30 teeth, and his dentist is quite busy. The dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. 

To find out the total number of teeth the dentist fixes, we need to add the number of teeth he drills and the number of teeth he caps. The dentist drills 4 teeth, and he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

So, the total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

Now, let's find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes. We can do this by dividing the total number of teeth the dentist fixes (15) by the total number of James' teeth (30), and then multiplying by 100.

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

The final answer is: 50"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the amount of milk that was returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons. 

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons of milk were returned.

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.

Refund = 1600 * 3.5 = 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

The final answer is: 20"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Bob wants to buy books for 3 schools with a total budget of $27,000. He can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy in total, I'll divide the total amount of money by the cost of 100 books.

Total books = Total money / Cost per 100 books
Total books = $27,000 / $500
Total books = 54

Now, to find out how many books he can buy per school, I'll divide the total number of books by the number of schools.

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 54 / 3
Books per school = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples. Total apples = 1 (in pocket) + 5 (new) = 6.
3. He put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 5 apples in his pocket. Total apples = 1 (outside) + 5 (in pocket) = 6.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples. Total apples = 6 (from previous step) + 6 (new) = 12.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, so he now has 12 apples in total.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples."
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to calculate the number of bags of coal he ordered and multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, let's find the number of bags: 
Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, we know the cost per bag is $18. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem together. We have two types of pizzas: cheese and pepperoni. The cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. Kate's 6 friends each eat 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices.

To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat, and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Sam's running schedule for the week. He ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's a total of 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, let's add the miles from both sets of days: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. To find out how many snowballs he builds per minute, we divide 20 by 60. 

20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find out how many snowballs melt per minute, we divide 2 by 15.

2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, let's find the net rate of snowballs by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate. 

(1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how long it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Time = Number of snowballs / Rate = 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 300"

Let's see... if John is 28 now, that means he was 28 - 20 = 8 years old when Digimon first came out. Since John was twice as old as Jim back then, Jim must have been 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now, to find Jim's current age, I just need to add 20 to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

So, Jim is 24 years old."

"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 50 / 2 = 25).
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages (since they ordered 1 pack of 50).
After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages.
After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100 bandages (since they ordered 2 packs of 50).

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Jen's earnings for April.

To find Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her regular pay and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April.
Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours.
Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days.
Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. To do that, we need to divide the total number of fish by 3.

66 / 3 = 22

Now, we need to find out how many fish don't have red stripes. We can do that by subtracting the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

66 - 22 = 44

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining fish have blue stripes. To do that, we need to multiply the number of fish without red stripes by 5/11.

(5/11) * 44 = 20

Now, we need to add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to find the total number of fish with both red and blue stripes.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, and the first floor's height is 180 inches, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the first floor's height from the total height of the house:
420 - 180 = 240 inches

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house:

If a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, let's calculate how much he'll earn after selling all the tunas to the market.

To find the total weight of the tunas, we need to add the weights of all three tunas. 

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price

"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the capacity of John's classes, we need to find 1/8 of Ali's class capacity. 

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. 
1/8 of 120 is 120 / 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 
Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

The final answer is: 150"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. 

First, we need to calculate the interest he owes. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

Now, let's find the remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. This is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out the total number of diaper changes per day. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. To find out how many diapers she changes, we divide the total number of diaper changes by 2: 10 / 2 = 5.

Since Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day, Jordan changes the remaining half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's dive into the problem. We're given a jar with a square base, measuring 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall. We need to find out how far off Tim's guess was about the number of red jelly beans in the jar.

First, we calculate the total volume of the jar by multiplying its length, width, and height.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Now, we find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean, which is 0.15 cubic inches.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we're told that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed. Unfortunately, we don't know what Tim's guess was, so we'll assume he guessed the number of red jelly beans to be 864.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

The final answer is: 20"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Pauline's museum visits.

First, we need to find out how much Pauline spent on visits for the first 5 years. Since she visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the next 3 years. The cost of one visit has increased by 150%, so the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

To find the total cost for all visits, we add the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you figure out how long it will take for all the students at Cedar Falls Middle School to try the escape room.

To start, we need to find out how many students in total are trying to go to the escape room. There are 4 grades (4-7), and each grade has 10 students. So, the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many groups can be formed: 40 / 8 = 5.

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, and there are 5 groups. To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we multiply the number of groups by the time each group takes: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

So, John is a carpenter who made some wooden items for his friend Ali. He made 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Ian has a 40-foot board, and he wants to cut it into two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. Let's figure out how long the longer piece is.

Let's say the shorter piece is x feet long. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the longer piece is 4x feet long.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it's divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's figure out how much of Aiden's secret seasoning he needs for the cookout. To do that, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, so we can multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total seasoning needed.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Luke is buying fabric for new curtains, and he has five windows. Each window is 35 inches wide. He needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. To find the total width, we multiply the width of one window by the number of windows.

Width of one window: 35 inches
Number of windows: 5

Total width of windows = 35 * 5 = 175 inches

Now, we need to multiply the total width by 2 to find out how much fabric Luke should buy.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total cost of the call, we need to calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes (36 - 16 = 20), the cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost is $4 + $4 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know it rained 2 inches on Monday. To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate the amount of rain on Tuesday, which is expected to be 1 inch more than twice the amount of Monday's total.

Twice the amount of rain on Monday is 2 x 2 = 4 inches.
Adding 1 inch to that is 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

So, the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches.

The final answer is: 5"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Carly's cupcake and brownie problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we say the number of cupcakes is x, then the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation: 
x + 3x - 2 = 10
4x - 2 = 10
4x = 12
x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost for Karen's manicure and pedicure.

First, let's start with the basic prices. A manicure costs $35, and a pedicure costs $40. If Karen chooses to get both, she'll get a 20% discount on the total price. 

The discount on the manicure is 20% of $35, which is 0.2 * 35 = $7. 
The discount on the pedicure is 20% of $40, which is 0.2 * 40 = $8.

The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15.

The cost of the manicure after the discount is $35 - $7 = $28.
The cost of the pedicure after the discount is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.
3. Samantha has 27 paintings.

From point 1, we know that Shelley has 12 more paintings than Samantha. Since Samantha has 27 paintings, Shelley must have 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

From point 2, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. Since Shelley has 39 paintings, Kim must have 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's calculate the price of the toy after the discounts.

First, we need to find the price in December after an 80% increase from the initial price of $40. 
Price increase = 80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we need to find the price in January after a 50% decrease from the price in December.
Price decrease = 50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"Let's break down Charlie's income for the day. He has 4 standard rate lessons and 2 reduced rate lessons. 

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie charges $80 per hour. 
Total amount from standard rate lessons = 4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie charges 75% of his standard rate, which is $80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour. 
Total amount from reduced rate lessons = 2 * $60 = $120

To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we add the amounts from the standard and reduced rate lessons together.
Total amount of money Charlie will make for the day = $320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve the problem together.

Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving her friend some pomelos, Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to determine what 1/4 of 20 is.

To find 1/4 of 20, we multiply 20 by 1/4: 20 * (1/4) = 5. This means Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

Since Eve originally had 20 pomelos and is left with 5, the number of pomelos she gave away is the difference between the original amount and the remaining amount: 20 - 5 = 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Walter bought 60 apples from the store. To find out how many apples he ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find the number of apples remaining.

60 - 24 = 36

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples.

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, let's find the number of apples remaining.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple.

The amount of money he received = 27 * 3 = 81

First, we need to find the total number of hours Michael traveled. Since he traveled for 3 days, and there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Next, we need to find the distance covered by multiplying his average speed by the total number of hours. 

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance covered = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the distance covered. 

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

So, the percentage of the distance covered is 60%.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Madeline ate 6 grapes. Then, her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Now, their mother used the remaining grapes to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is 36 / 12 = 3 pies. The total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.

To find the initial number of grapes, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. The total number of grapes used is 36 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) + 36 (by their mother) = 102 grapes.

Since the mother used all the remaining grapes to make 3 pies, we can conclude that the initial number of grapes is 102.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all her books.

Let's start by determining the capacity of each shelf. The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase: 
Middle shelf 1 + Middle shelf 2 + Bottom shelf + Top shelf = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are needed to hold all of them. To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 
110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the eggs. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen, we multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen.

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's find the total revenue. Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3.

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since she sells each set for $1, the total revenue will be:

20 sets * $1/set = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. 

We know that B = 5S - 4. 

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B into the second equation, we get S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"Let's break down the situation. There are 4 people in Brianna's family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Now, let's count the candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Mitchell is making nachos for his family, and he buys two bags of chips with 55 chips in each bag. To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first calculate the total number of chips.

The total number of chips is 2 bags * 55 chips per bag, which equals 110 chips.

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members, which is 5. 

110 chips / 5 family members = 22 chips per person.

So, each family member gets 22 chips."
"Let's break down the time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube. The first side takes 5 minutes. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each. The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides: 
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the information given: Dominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there. If there were 20 helmets, we can start by finding the number of robots. Since there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Next, we need to find the number of footballs. Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together: 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call. 

First, we need to convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

To find out how many calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5: 24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

The final answer is: 120"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 7 minutes * 6 = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 12 minutes * 6 = 72 minutes.

Now, let's find the difference in time between the old varnish and the new varnish: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Crista's plant watering problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Crista has 20 plants in total. Some of them need half a cup of water, some need 1 cup, and the rest need a quarter of a cup.

First, we need to find out how many plants need half a cup of water, 1 cup of water, and a quarter of a cup of water. We know that 4 plants need half a cup of water, and 8 plants need 1 cup of water. To find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water, we subtract the number of plants that need half a cup and 1 cup of water from the total number of plants: 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for each type of plant. The 4 plants that need half a cup of water will need 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups. The 8 plants that need 1 cup of water will need 8 * 1 = 8 cups. And the 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water will need 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add up the water needed for each type of plant: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

"Let's break down Phineas Frog's journey to return home. He's been washed away by the rainstorm and needs to hop and swim his way back. We know he hops at 20 yards per minute on land and swims at 10 yards per minute in water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the time it takes for each part of the journey. The total distance is 200 yards, so half of it is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

To cover 100 yards on land at 20 yards per minute, it would take Phineas 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

To cover 100 yards in water at 10 yards per minute, it would take Phineas 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Adding these times together, we get 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Bob wants to recreate the Washington Monument using popsicle sticks for his history project. He needs 56 popsicle sticks, and they come 8 to a box. Each box costs $2.00.

To find out how many boxes Bob needs, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of sticks per box: 56 / 8 = 7. So, Bob needs 7 boxes.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. We multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 7 * $2.00 = $14.00.

The final answer is: $14.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have five phones on a phone plan, and the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. The main phone costs $20.

To find the cost of the additional phones, we need to determine the cost of one additional phone. Let's call this cost x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, Derrick makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

The price of each doughnut is $2. So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in a day is 120 * $2 = $240.

June has 30 days. Therefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is $240 * 30 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"

To find out how many days it'll take her to upload all her photos, I need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day. 

First, let's calculate how many photos she can upload per day: 6 batches * 7 photos per batch = 42 photos per day.

Now, let's divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day: 210 / 42 = 5.

So, it'll take Jade 5 days to upload all her photos."
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Alicia's dry-cleaning expenses.

To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost for each item and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

First, let's calculate the cost for blouses: 5 blouses at $5.00 each is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00 per week.

Next, we'll calculate the cost for skirts: 1 skirt at $6.00 is $6.00 per week.

Now, let's calculate the cost for pants: 2 pairs of pants at $8.00 each is 2 * $8.00 = $16.00 per week.

Now, let's add up the costs for each item: $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00 per week.

Finally, we'll multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks: $47.00 * 5 = $235.00.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how long it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to determine his new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he's 2.5 times faster after training.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, let's calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, we can divide the total number of words by the new speaking speed.

Time = Total words / New speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 hours

The final answer is: 12"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Conor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun. On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were present at the beach than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people he saw on the first three days to the number of people he saw on the remaining days: 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Garrett is popping popcorn, and we need to find the total number of pieces he has to eat.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to three times the initial amount, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial popping rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

The final answer is: 210"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with Tim's lemonade problem.

To make lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice for every gallon. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to figure out how many lemons are needed for 5 gallons of lemonade.

First, let's calculate the total amount of juice needed for 5 gallons. Since each gallon requires 1 cup of juice, we multiply the number of gallons by the amount of juice per gallon.

Total cups of juice = 5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade. This lemonade is twice as tart as the other gallons, which means it requires twice the amount of lemon juice. 

Extra tart lemonade cups = 1 gallon * 2 = 2 cups

Since the extra tart lemonade requires 2 cups of juice, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for this amount. We know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, so we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 2 cups of juice.

Lemons for extra tart lemonade = 2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the regular lemonade. We already know that 5 cups of juice are needed, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.

Lemons for regular lemonade = 5 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 5/6 * 6 = 5 lemons

To find the total number of lemons needed, we add the lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade and the regular lemonade.

Total lemons needed = 2 lemons (for the extra tart lemonade) + 5 lemons (for the regular lemonade) = 7 lemons

The final answer is: 7"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the Kennel house.

First, we need to find out how much food the German Shepherds and Bulldogs consume in a day. The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms of dog food each, and there are 3 of them, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms per day. The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each, and there are 2 of them, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms per day.

Now, let's add the daily consumption of both the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs: 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day.

To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 10 animals with 2 legs each and 15 animals with 4 legs each. 

First, we'll calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs.

Now, we'll add the total number of legs from both types of animals: 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs.

Since the question asks for pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs: 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs.

"Let's break down Elvis's journey. He travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph. To find the distance traveled west, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.

Then, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed. To find the distance traveled east, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far he is from his house now. 

The distance traveled west is 90 miles, and the distance traveled east is 144 miles. The difference is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

"Let's calculate the value of the boat after three years.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, it depreciated by 30%, which is 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. So, the value after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, it depreciated by another 30%, which is 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. So, the value after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, it depreciated by 20%, which is 0.2 * $4410 = $882. So, the value after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a bag of Starbursts candies with a total of 232 pieces. We know that there are 54 red candies. 

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so it's 2 * 54 = 108.

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so it's 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins, Dallas and Darla. We know that Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them in the playground. To find out how many marbles Dallas initially had, we need to add the marbles he dropped back to the marbles he has now.

Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, so he must have had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles initially.

Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas received 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting 25 from 52.

52 - 25 = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add their individual weights together.

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each. 

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

Force = 1% * 1600
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, John invited 20 people to a birthday party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. He already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over, so we subtract those from the total required:
Total hot dogs required: 40 - 4 = 36

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:
36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
6 * 2 = 12

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 2 brothers and 3 sisters in the family. The sisters are all the same age, which is 16 years old. One of the brothers is 12 years old, and this is half the age of the older brother.

Since one brother is 12 years old, the older brother must be 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

Now, let's calculate the total age of the sisters. Since there are 3 sisters and each is 16 years old, their total age is 3 * 16 = 48 years.

Next, we need to find the total age of the brothers. We already know that one brother is 12 years old, and the other is 24 years old. So, the total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36 years.

"Let's break down Charisma's daily routine. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, which adds up to 30 minutes per day. Since she does this every day, the weekly meditation time is 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

Charisma also practices yoga for 1 hour, or 60 minutes, 5 days a week. So, her weekly yoga time is 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week, we add the two together: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks: 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help Octavia calculate the total square feet of fabric needed for her quilt.

To find the total square feet of fabric used, we need to calculate the total square feet from each type of shirt and add them together.

Small shirts are 3 square feet each, and Octavia has 11 of them. So, the total square feet from small shirts is 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.

Medium shirts are 4 square feet each, and Octavia has 8 of them. So, the total square feet from medium shirts is 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.

Large shirts are 6 square feet each, and Octavia has 6 of them. So, the total square feet from large shirts is 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

Now, let's add the total square feet from each type of shirt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101

The final answer is: 101"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's count the sunflower seeds together.

First, we need to find out how many seeds are in a small sunflower. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

Now, let's find out how many seeds are in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. Then, we add this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

To find the total number of seeds, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that George has 18 pens. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has by multiplying 18 by 3. 

18 * 3 = 54

Now, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can calculate the number of pens Sarah has by dividing the number of pens Timothy has by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

The final answer is: 27"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out Jackie's height before summer.

We know Albert is 36"" tall, and Anne is twice the size of Albert. So, Anne's height is 2 * 36 = 72"".

Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, her height is 72 - 2 = 70"".

We also know that Jackie grew 3"" over the summer. To find her height before summer, we need to subtract the growth from her current height: 70 - 3 = 67"".

So, Jackie's height before summer was 67"".

The final answer is: 67"
"Let's calculate the total money the company receives for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

First, we need to find out how many bars the company produces in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, and there are 7 days in a week, it produces 5000 * 7 = 35000 bars in one week.

Now, we multiply the number of bars produced in one week by 2 to get the total number of bars produced in two weeks: 35000 * 2 = 70000 bars.

The price per bar is $2. To find the total money the company receives, we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar: 70000 * 2 = $140000.

The final answer is: $140000"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, but there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, he only pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Ryan's problem.

Ryan gets $6 each week he completes his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he earned a total of 6 * 3 = $18.

Then, he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. That's a total of 4 cones, so the cost is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance: $18 - $5 = $13.

Finally, we need to find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy. Each ticket costs $6.50, so we'll divide the remaining money by the cost of a ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Ellen and her sister Lani went to the mall to buy some presents for their mom. Let's see what they bought.

Ellen got a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. That's a total of $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani, on the other hand, bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes, each costing $100. So, the two bathrobes together cost $100 x 2 = $200. Adding the sunglasses to that, Lani spent $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, let's add up the total amount they spent. Ellen spent $105 and Lani spent $230, so together they spent $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"Let's break down the cost of making one jar of Tim's special honey and jam mix. It requires 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 per pound, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 per pound, and 2 pounds of honey at $10 per pound.

The cost of passion fruit is 2 * $6 = $12.
The cost of jackfruit is 1.5 * $8 = $12.
The cost of honey is 2 * $10 = $20.

Adding these costs together, we get the total cost of making one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Now, let's consider the selling price of one jar, which is $50. To find the profit from one jar, we subtract the cost from the selling price: $50 - $44 = $6.

Since Tim sells 10 jars, we multiply the profit from one jar by 10 to find the total profit: $6 * 10 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's calculate the total dollar amount in the jar.

First, we need to find the value of each type of coin. 

- 32 quarters = 32 x $0.25 = $8
- 95 dimes = 95 x $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 x $0.05 = $6
- 750 pennies = 750 x $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together:
$8 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. So, Janet went to the mall and spent some money on ice cream, movie tickets, and a bracelet. Let's break it down:

She spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 each for two movie tickets, and $8.50 on a bracelet. To find the total amount she spent, we need to add these costs together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the movie tickets: 2 * $7.50 = $15. Now, we add the costs together: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27.

Janet's parents gave her $40, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the amount her parents gave her: $40 - $27 = $13.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Josh runs a car shop and services 3 cars a day. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. He gets paid $4 per car. To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday) and not open 2 days a week (Sunday and Wednesday). So, he is open 5 days a week.

In 1 week, Josh is open 5 days, so he services 5 * 3 = 15 cars.

In 2 weeks, Josh is open 10 days, so he services 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 2 weeks, he makes 30 * $4 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the cookie situation. Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. That's a total of 18 cookies.

Randy eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he eats 3 cookies in total.

Then, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.

After that, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends.

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. That's 12 new cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:
He started with 18 cookies, then had 3 eaten, 2 more eaten, and 2 given away, for a total of 7 cookies gone. Then, he added 12 new cookies.

Total cookies now = 18 - 7 + 12
Total cookies now = 23

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, and he wants to sell them for a fair price. He found a buyer who is willing to pay for half his collection $5 per toy, and for the other half $7 per toy.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, he can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30.

For the second half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.

To find the total amount, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day, and Nate is on vacation for 14 days. So, the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation is 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

However, the dog continues to dig 6 new holes every night, so we need to add these to the total holes dug during the day. Since Nate fills the holes for the same number of days he was on vacation, we'll assume he fills the holes for 14 days. The total number of holes is 84 (holes dug during the day) + 84 (holes dug at night) = 168 holes.

Now, let's find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 / 3
Days to fill holes = 56

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7.

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Average enrollment at Norman High School: 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School: 4000 * (3/4) = 3000 students

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in enrollment: 4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made.

To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Let's start by adding the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies: 2595 + 3075 = 5670.

Now, let's subtract this total from the overall number of cookies made: 7995 - 5670 = 2325.

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: This means he gathered 12 Petri dishes, since 12 + 2 = 14, but 14 is the number of test tubes, not Petri dishes. So, 12 Petri dishes is the correct number.
- Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 12 Petri dishes = 27 items.

Since Igor had 29 items on the lab bench, he must have lost 29 - 27 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. James is putting together 4 tables, and each table has 4 legs. Since each leg needs 2 screws, we need to find out how many screws are required for all the legs.

First, we calculate the total number of legs: 4 tables * 4 legs per table = 16 legs.

Next, we calculate the total number of screws needed for the legs: 16 legs * 2 screws per leg = 32 screws.

Now, we know James has 40 screws in total. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's count the eggs together. We have 10 eggs in the first basket. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, we need to multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2 to find the number of eggs in the second basket.

So, 10 eggs * 2 = 20 eggs in the second basket.

Now, let's add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Alexandra raises $430. Since Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

We also know that Sarah raises $300. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes, Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x minutes.

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance of Vanessa (since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron), we can set up the equation:

x * 2 = 16 (since Aaron ran half the distance of Vanessa, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile:
Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. 

Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3: 
200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

He already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total amount needed: 
600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"Let's calculate the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant. They get 6 reservations a night and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5) + $5 (bottle of wine) = (2 * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15
Daily revenue = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days they are open.

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * Number of days open = $15 * 2 = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to first figure out the total amount of money the fruit vendor made from selling all 50 watermelons. Since he made a 25% profit, that means he sold them for 125% of the cost price (100% of the cost price + 25% profit).

The cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. To find the cost price of one watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons: $80 / 50 = $1.60.

Now, let's find the selling price of one watermelon. Since the selling price is 125% of the cost price, we multiply the cost price by 1.25: $1.60 * 1.25 = $2.

So, the fruit vendor sold each watermelon for $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John had James when he was 19. This means the time that has passed since then is 18 - 19 = -1 year. However, since age cannot be negative, this means the information given is inconsistent.

But let's continue with the problem. We are also told that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. This means John's youngest son is currently 32 years old. In 3 years, his age will be 32 + 3 = 35 years.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange, and Jane takes 4 minutes to do the same. 

To find out how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour, we need to divide the total minutes in an hour (60) by the time it takes each of them to peel an orange.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane. The difference is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

"Let's break down the cost of Mark's new radiator and installation.

First, Mark gets the radiator at a junk shop with an 80% discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400. To find the discount amount, multiply the original cost by the discount percentage: 400 * 0.8 = $320. Then, subtract the discount from the original cost to get the discounted price: 400 - 320 = $80.

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. To find the labor cost, multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly rate: 3 * 50 = $150.

Now, add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total cost: 80 + 150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of animals on the farm is 20, and they are either chickens or cows. Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. So, we have the equation C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can express the total number of legs as 2C + 4W = 70.

Now, let's solve for W in the first equation: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the second equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

So, the number of chickens on the farm is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
