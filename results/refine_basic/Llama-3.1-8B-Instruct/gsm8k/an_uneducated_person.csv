"So, Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins. That's 7 eggs gone. Now, we gotta find out how many eggs she's got left. 

16 - 7 is 9. So, she's got 9 eggs left. She sells 'em for 2 bucks each. 

9 * 2 is 18. So, she makes 18 bucks a day."
"So, you wanna know how many bolts of fiber it takes to make a robe? Alright, let me think... It says here it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. And then it says it takes half that much white fiber. Half of 2 is 1, right? So, it takes 1 bolt of white fiber.

So, if it takes 2 bolts of blue and 1 bolt of white, that's... 2 + 1 = 3 bolts. Yeah, it takes 3 bolts in total."
"So Josh buys a house for 80,000 bucks. Then he puts in 50,000 dollars in repairs. This makes the house worth more, a lot more. It's like, 150% more. That's like, double plus 50% more.

So, let's figure out how much the house is worth now. We gotta add the 50,000 to the original price, and then we gotta multiply the original price by 2.5 (which is 100% + 150%). 

So, the original price is 80,000. Multiply that by 2.5, that's 200,000. Then we add the 50,000 we spent on repairs. That's 200,000 + 50,000, which is 250,000.

Now, we gotta find out how much Josh spent in total. He spent 80,000 on the house, and 50,000 on repairs. That's 130,000.

So, the profit is how much the house is worth now, minus how much Josh spent. That's 250,000 - 130,000, which is 120,000.

The final answer is: $120,000"
"So James runs 3 sprints a day, 3 times a week. And each sprint is 60 meters. So, if he runs 3 sprints, that's 3 * 60 = 180 meters. Now, he does this 3 times a week, so that's 180 * 3 = 540 meters. 

The final answer is: 540"
"So, Wendi's got 20 chickens, and she gives 'em 3 cups of food each time. She gives 'em food in three meals. In the mornin', she gives 'em 15 cups. Then in the afternoon, she gives 'em 25 cups. I wanna know how many cups she needs to give 'em in the last meal.

First, I gotta figure out how many cups she's already given 'em. She gave 'em 15 in the mornin', and 25 in the afternoon. That's 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Now, I know each chicken gets 3 cups of food, and she's got 20 chickens. So, that's 3 * 20 = 60 cups of food she needs to give 'em in one meal.

Now, I just need to figure out how many cups she needs to give 'em in the last meal. I know she's already given 'em 40 cups, so I just subtract that from the total: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. One glass costs $5, but the next one costs 60% of that, which is $3. Then the next one costs 60% of $3, which is $1.80. And it keeps goin' down like that.

Let me think about it... If I keep doin' that, the prices are $5, $3, $1.80, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.23, $0.14, $0.08, $0.05, $0.03, $0.02, $0.01, $0.006, $0.004, $0.0025.

Now, I gotta add 'em all up. Let me count... $5 + $3 = $8, $8 + $1.80 = $9.80, $9.80 + $1.08 = $10.88, $10.88 + $0.64 = $11.52, $11.52 + $0.384 = $11.904, $11.904 + $0.23 = $12.134, $12.134 + $0.14 = $12.274, $12.274 + $0.08 = $12.354, $12.354 + $0.05 = $12.404, $12.404 + $0.03 = $12.434, $12.434 + $0.02 = $12.454, $12.454 + $0.01 = $12.464, $12.464 + $0.006 = $12.47, $12.47 + $0.004 = $12.474, $12.474 + $0.0025 = $12.4765.

So, Kylar needs to pay $12.48 for 16 glasses."
"So, let's figure this out. Seattle's got 20 sheep. Now, Charleston's got 4 times as many as Seattle, so that's 4 * 20, which is 80. Now, Toulouse's got twice as many as Charleston, so that's 2 * 80, which is 160.

Now, we gotta add 'em all up. 160 + 80 + 20 is... 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"So Carla's downloadin' a big file, 200 GB. She's got a fast connection, 2 GB a minute. But then Windows starts actin' up and makes her restart. It takes 20 minutes to install the updates. Then she's gotta start all over again.

First, she downloads 40% of the file. That's 80 GB. It takes her 40 minutes to do that. Then she's gotta wait 20 minutes for the updates. After that, she's gotta download the rest of the file, which is 120 GB. That takes her 60 minutes.

So, let's add all that up. 40 minutes to download the first part, 20 minutes for the updates, and 60 minutes to download the rest. That's 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"So, John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. That's 60 * 3 = 180 miles. Then he turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. But he gets stuck in traffic for 2 hours, so he don't move at all. Then he drives for half an hour at 30 miles per hour, which is 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles. After that, he drives for 2 hours at 80 miles per hour, which is 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

So, he traveled 180 miles to get to where he was going, then 15 miles back, and then 160 miles back home. That's 355 miles total. But he's home now, so he's 0 miles away from home."
"So Eliza gets paid $10 an hour for the first 40 hours she works. Then she gets paid 1.2 times that for the hours she works after that. She worked 45 hours this week. 

First, I gotta figure out how much she gets for the first 40 hours. That's just 40 * 10, which is 400 bucks. 

Now, I gotta figure out how much she gets for the extra hours. She worked 45 hours, so she worked 5 extra hours. Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular pay, which is 1.2 * 10, which is 12 bucks an hour. So, she gets 5 * 12, which is 60 bucks for the extra hours.

Now, I just add those two numbers together. 400 + 60 is 460.

The final answer is: $460"
"So, the program had 60 downloads in the first month. Then, in the second month, it had three times as many downloads as the first month, which is 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

Now, in the third month, they took 30% off the second month's downloads. 30% of 180 is 54, so they took away 54 downloads. That means they had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads in the third month.

So, if we add up all the downloads, we get 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The final answer is: 366"
"So, Toula went to the bakery and bought some stuff. She got 3 dozen donuts for $68 a dozen, 2 dozen mini cupcakes for $80 a dozen, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes for $55 a dozen. I gotta figure out how much she paid in total.

First, I think about the donuts. 3 dozen is a lot of donuts. That's 3 times 68 dollars. That's 204 dollars.

Then I think about the cupcakes. 2 dozen is a bunch of cupcakes. That's 2 times 80 dollars. That's 160 dollars.

And then there's the cheesecakes. 6 dozen is a whole lotta cheesecakes. That's 6 times 55 dollars. That's 330 dollars.

Now, I gotta add all that up. 204 + 160 + 330 is... 694 dollars.

The final answer is: $694"
"So, Carlos is plantin' a lemon tree. It's gonna cost him 90 bucks to plant it. Then, every year, it's gonna grow 7 lemons, and he can sell 'em for 1.5 bucks each. It's also gonna cost him 3 bucks a year to water and feed the tree.

So, he's gonna make 7 lemons * 1.5 bucks per lemon, that's 10.5 bucks a year. But then he's gotta pay 3 bucks to take care of it, so he's left with 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 bucks a year.

Now, he needs to pay back the 90 bucks he spent on the tree. So, we gotta divide 90 by 7.5. That's like, 90 divided by 7.5 is... 12.

So, it's gonna take him 12 years to pay back the tree. But, I guess that's when he'll start makin' money, 'cause he's already makin' 7.5 bucks a year.

The final answer is: 12"
"So, Melanie sold some vacuum cleaners. She sold a third of 'em at the green house. Then she sold 2 more at the red house. After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Now she's got 5 vacuum cleaners left. I gotta figure out how many she started with.

Let's see... If she sold a third at the green house, that means she's got two thirds left. Then she sold 2 more at the red house. That means she's got two thirds minus 2. Then she sold half of what was left at the orange house. That's like, half of two thirds minus 2. I think I need to find out what two thirds minus 2 is first.

Two thirds is like, 2 divided by 3. That's like, 0.666... So two thirds minus 2 is like, 0.666... minus 2. That's like, -1.334... But you can't have a negative number of vacuum cleaners, so that's not right.

Let me try again. If she sold a third at the green house, that means she's got two thirds left. Then she sold 2 more at the red house. That means she's got two thirds minus 2. That's like, 0.666... minus 2. That's like, -1.334... No, that's not right.

Wait a minute... If she sold a third at the green house, that means she's got two thirds left. Then she sold 2 more at the red house. That means she's got two thirds minus 2.

"So, there's a dance class with 20 students. Some of 'em do contemporary dance, some do jazz, and some do hip-hop. 20% of 'em do contemporary, which is 4 students. That leaves 16 students.

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students do jazz dance, which is 4 students. That means 12 students are left, and they do hip-hop.

To find out what percent of the whole class does hip-hop, I'll divide 12 by 20 and multiply by 100. That's 60%.

So, the answer is 60%."
"So the merchant gotta choose between buyin' some fancy jewelry worth $5,000 or some electronic gadgets worth $8,000. The advisor says the jewelry market's gonna go up 2.5% and the gadgets market's gonna go up 1.2% in the same month. 

Let's see, 2.5% of $5,000 is $125, and 1.2% of $8,000 is $96. So if the merchant buys the jewelry, he'll make a profit of $125. If he buys the gadgets, he'll make a profit of $96.

So, the merchant should buy the jewelry to make a profit of $125."
"I don't rightly understand this problem, but I'll give it a shot. So, we got two trains, and they leave San Rafael at the same time. They go west for 80 miles, then the next day they go north for 150 miles. I reckon we gotta figure out how far each train went in total.

Now, I know that if you go 80 miles one way and 150 miles the other way, you're not just gonna add 'em together. That don't make no sense. You gotta think about it like a right triangle, I reckon. The distance they went west and the distance they went north, that's like the two sides of a right triangle. And the hypotenuse, that's the distance they went in total.

So, I'm gonna use some fancy math to figure this out. I'm gonna square the numbers, add 'em together, and then take the square root. That's what my friend told me to do.

80^2 is 6400, and 150^2 is 22500. Now, I add 'em together: 6400 + 22500 = 28900. Then, I take the square root of that: √28900 = 170.

So, each train went 170 miles in total."
"So, Jill gets paid 20 bucks an hour to teach and 30 bucks an hour to be a cheerleading coach. She works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week teachin' and 15 hours a week coachin'. 

First, let's figure out how much she makes from teachin'. She teaches 35 hours a week, and that's 50 weeks a year, so that's 35 * 50 = 1750 hours. Now, if she makes 20 bucks an hour, that's 1750 * 20 = 35,000 bucks a year from teachin'.

Now, let's figure out how much she makes from coachin'. She coaches 15 hours a week, and that's 50 weeks a year, so that's 15 * 50 = 750 hours. Now, if she makes 30 bucks an hour, that's 750 * 30 = 22,500 bucks a year from coachin'.

So, if you add 'em together, she makes 35,000 + 22,500 = 57,500 bucks a year.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"So, Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every mornin'. I wanna know how many dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks. 

First, I gotta figure out how many days in 4 weeks. I know there's 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Now, Claire eats 3 eggs a day, so in 28 days, she eats 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Now, I gotta figure out how many dozens that is. There's 12 eggs in a dozen, so I divide 84 by 12. That's 84 / 12 = 7.

So, Claire eats 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 7"
"So Marissa's goin' on a 12-mile hike. She already walked 4 miles in 1 hour, and then another 2 miles in another hour. That's 6 miles in 2 hours. Now she's got 12 miles total, and she wants to walk it in 3 hours, 'cause 12 miles divided by 4 miles per hour is 3 hours. 

She's already used up 2 hours, so she's got 1 hour left. She's got 6 miles left to go. To find out how fast she needs to walk, you gotta divide the miles left by the hours left. That's 6 miles divided by 1 hour, which is 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"So, you got 10 liters of orange drink and it's 2/3 water. That means 2 out of 3 parts of it is water. So, 2/3 of 10 is... um... let me think... 6.67. Yeah, that's right. So, you got 6.67 liters of water in the orange drink.

Now, you got 15 liters of pineapple drink and it's 3/5 water. That means 3 out of 5 parts of it is water. So, 3/5 of 15 is... um... 9. That's right. So, you got 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink.

Now, you mix 'em together and you got 10 + 15 = 25 liters. But you spill 1 liter of the orange drink. So, you got 24 liters left. Now, you wanna know how much water is in the 24 liters. 

You got 6.67 liters of water from the orange drink and 9 liters of water from the pineapple drink. That's 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters of water. But you spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so you gotta subtract that from the water. That's 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters of water.

Now, you got 24 liters in total, and 14.67 liters of water. That means the rest is not water. So, 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters of not water. Now, you gotta find out how much water is in that 9.33 liters of not water. 

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so 1/3 is not water. So, 1/3 of 9.33 is... um... 3.11. That's the water in the 9.33 liters of not water from the orange drink.

The pineapple drink is 2/5 not water, so 3/5 is water. So, 3/5 of 9.33 is... um... 3.732. That's the water in the 9.33 liters of not water from the pineapple drink.

Now, you add all the water together: 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512. That's the water in the 24 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"So, Samantha is 31 years old, and Raymond is 6 years younger than her. That means Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Now, Raymond had a kid when he was 23 years old. To figure out how long ago that was, I gotta subtract 23 from 25. That's 25 - 23 = 2.

So, Raymond's kid was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"So, let's figure this out. Billy's got 8 customers on Tuesday. The first 3 customers, they each buy one DVD, so that's 3 DVDs. Then, the next 2 customers, they buy 2 DVDs each, so that's 4 more DVDs. And the last 3 customers, they don't buy any DVDs.

So, we add the first 3 and the next 4, that's 7 DVDs. That's how many Billy sold on Tuesday.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"So, you wanna know how much shorter a candle will be after it burns for 4 hours. It melts 2 centimeters every hour. 

Let's see, if it melts 2 centimeters every hour, and it burns for 4 hours, that's 2 * 4 = 8 centimeters. 

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter.

"So, Kyle bought a book for $19.50. He got it for a discount, and the discount was 25%. I wanna know how much the book cost before the discount.

Let's see... if it's 25% off, that means he paid 75% of the original price. So, I need to figure out what 75% of the original price is equal to $19.50.

I think I can do this by dividing $19.50 by 0.75. That's like, 75% in decimal form. 

$19.50 / 0.75 = $26

So, the book cost $26 before the discount.

The final answer is: $26"
"So Marie bought some stuff. She got a chicken meal for $12, 5 packs of milk for $3 each, and 4 apples for $1.50 each. Then she got some pizza boxes. She paid $50 in total. I gotta figure out how many pizza boxes she got.

First, I add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples. That's $12 + $15 (5 packs of milk) + $6 (4 apples) = $33.

Now, I gotta find out how much she spent on pizza. She paid $50, so I subtract the cost of the other stuff from that. $50 - $33 = $17.

Each pizza box costs $8.50. I need to find out how many boxes that is. I divide $17 by $8.50. That's $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie got 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"So, Mishka bought some stuff. He got 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. I don't know what any of that stuff costs, but I can figure it out.

Shorts cost 16.50 bucks a pair. So, 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x 16.50, that's 49.50 bucks.

Pants cost 22.50 bucks a pair. So, 3 pairs of pants is 3 x 22.50, that's 67.50 bucks.

Shoes cost 42 bucks a pair. So, 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x 42, that's 126 bucks.

Now, I gotta add all that up. 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 is... um... let me count it... 49.50 + 67.50 is 117, and then I gotta add 126 to that... 117 + 126 is 243.

The final answer is: $243"
"So Cynthia eats ice cream every night, and she buys it in cartons with 15 scoops in 'em. Each carton costs 4 bucks. She's gonna eat ice cream for 60 nights, so she needs 60 scoops. 

To find out how many cartons she needs, I'll divide 60 by 15. That's like, 60 little scoops divided by 15 little scoops in a carton. That's 4 cartons.

Now, I gotta multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton. That's 4 cartons times 4 bucks per carton. That's 16 bucks.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"So Henry went on a bike trip. He stopped twice. The first time was after 20 miles. Then he stopped again, but this time it was 15 miles before he got to the end of the trip. I wanna know how far he rode between them two stops.

Let's figure it out. If he stopped 15 miles before the end, that means he was 15 miles from the end when he stopped. So, if he was 20 miles in and 15 miles from the end, that means he rode 20 + 15 = 35 miles to get to the point where he stopped the second time. But that's not what we want. We want to know how far he rode between the two stops.

So, if he stopped after 20 miles, and then he stopped 15 miles before the end, that means he rode 20 miles to get to the first stop, and then he rode some miles to get to the second stop. We know he rode 15 miles less than the total trip to get to the second stop, so that's 60 - 15 = 45 miles. But that's the distance from the second stop to the end. We need to find the distance between the two stops.

Let's try it another way. If he rode 20 miles to get to the first stop, and then he rode some miles to get to the second stop, we can find the distance between the two stops by subtracting 20 from the distance from the second stop to the end. The distance from the second stop to the end is 45 miles, so we subtract 20 from that.

45 - 20 = 25

But wait, that's not right. We know he rode 15 miles less than the total trip to get to the second stop, and we know he rode 20 miles to get to the first stop. So, if he rode 20 miles to get to the first stop, and then he rode some miles to get to the second stop, we can find the distance between the two stops by subtracting 20 from the distance from the second stop to the end. The distance from the second stop to the end is 45 miles, so we subtract 20 from that.

45 - 20 = 25

No, that's still not right. Let's try it again. If he rode 20 miles to get to the first stop, and then he rode some miles to get to the second stop, we can find the distance between the two stops by subtracting 20 from the distance from the second stop to the end. The distance from the second stop to the end is 45 miles, so we subtract 20 from that.

"So Gloria's tryin' to buy some boots, but she's thinkin' 'bout them high heels too. She's got one pair that's $33, and the other's twice as much. That means the other one's 2 * 33, which is 66.

Now, the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. So, if we add the two pairs of heels together, we get 33 + 66, which is 99. But since they cost $5 less than the boots, we gotta add 5 to 99 to find out how much the boots cost.

So, 99 + 5 is 104. But wait, that can't be right. We gotta go back to the beginning. If the two pairs of heels cost $5 less than the boots, that means the boots cost 5 more than the two pairs of heels together. So, we gotta subtract 5 from 99.

99 - 5 is 94.

The final answer is: $94"
"So, Darrell and Allen's ages are in a ratio of 7 to 11. That means for every 7 parts Darrell is, Allen is 11 parts. Let's say Darrell is 7x and Allen is 11x, where x is some number.

We know their ages add up to 162. So, we gotta add 7x and 11x and get 162. That's 18x. Now, we gotta find out what 18x is equal to. It's 162.

So, we divide 162 by 18. That's 9. Now we know x is 9. 

Now we gotta find out how old Allen is. We multiply 11 by 9. That's 99. So, Allen is 99 years old.

Now, we gotta find out how old Allen will be in 10 years. We add 10 to 99. That's 109.

"So, Gunter's tryin' to count jelly beans in a jar. His friends give him guesses. One guy says 80. Another says 20 more than half of that, so that's 40 + 20, which is 60. Then there's another guy who says 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + 20, so that's 100.

So, we got 80, 60, and 100. We gotta find the average. We add 'em up: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. There's three people, so we divide 240 by 3. That's 80.

"So, Gretchen got 110 coins. And she got more gold coins than silver coins. She got 30 more gold coins than silver coins. I gotta figure out how many gold coins she got.

Let's say she got x silver coins. Then she got x + 30 gold coins. We know that x + (x + 30) = 110.

I think I know what that means. It means we gotta add x and x and then add 30, and that's gotta be 110. So, 2x + 30 = 110.

Now, I gotta get rid of the 30. I can do that by subtracting 30 from both sides. That makes 2x = 80.

Now, I gotta get rid of the 2. I can do that by dividing both sides by 2. That makes x = 40.

So, Gretchen got 40 silver coins. And she got 30 more gold coins than that. That means she got 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"So, let's figure this out. Raymond's got 40 jewels. Now, we gotta find out how many Aaron's got. We know Aaron's got 5 more jewels than half of what Raymond's got. Half of 40 is 20. So, Aaron's got 20 + 5, that's 25 jewels.

Now, Siobhan's got 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we gotta take 2 away from 25. That's 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"So, Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. He scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes. Then, in the next 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 

To find 25% of 4 points, I think of it like this: if I had 4 cookies and I wanted to give 25% of 'em to my friend, I'd give 'em 1 cookie. So, 25% of 4 points is 1 point. 

Now, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points (like he did in the first 20 minutes) plus 1 point (25% of 4 points). That's 5 points. 

So, in total, Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes and 5 points in the second 20 minutes. That's 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"So Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, right? And he does this for 30 days. That's 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts. 

Now, they're on sale, 4 yogurts for 5 bucks. So, how many sets of 4 yogurts does he buy? That's 60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Each set costs 5 bucks, so he spends 15 * 5 = 75 bucks on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"So John sells his Lego sets for 15 bucks each and he got 13 of 'em. He sells 'em all and then buys 8 video games for 20 bucks each. He's got 5 bucks left over. 

First, let's figure out how much money he made from sellin' the Lego sets. He got 13 sets and each one's worth 15 bucks, so that's 13 * 15 = 195 bucks. Then he spent 160 bucks on video games, so that's 8 * 20. He's got 5 bucks left, so he spent 195 - 5 = 190 bucks on the video games.

Now, we gotta figure out how much money he used from the Lego sales to buy the video games. That's 190 bucks. Now we gotta find out how many Lego sets he sold for that. 190 / 15 = 12.67. But you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set, so he musta sold 12 sets with his own money and the rest with the money from the Lego sales.

He started with 13 sets, so he's got 13 - 12 = 1 set left."
"So John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 hours the first day, and then he runs half that on the other two days. That's 1.5 hours each day.

So, he runs 3 hours the first day, and then 1.5 hours the other two days. That's 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours total.

Now, we gotta figure out how many hours he runs in a week. He runs 3 days a week, so we multiply 6 hours by 3. That's 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Now, we gotta find out how fast he runs. We know he runs 60 miles in 18 hours. To find out how fast he runs, we divide the miles by the hours. That's 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 3.33"
"So, Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. That's fast, right? But she can run way faster than that. She can run 6 miles per hour. That's because she can run four times faster than she can walk. And if she can run 6 miles per hour, then she must be able to walk 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's figure out how much time she spends walkin' and runnin'. She spends two-thirds of the time walkin' and one-third of the time runnin'. So, if she's got 6 hours, she spends 4 hours walkin' and 2 hours runnin'.

Now, let's see how far she goes. She walks 1.5 miles per hour, so in 4 hours, she walks 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles. And she runs 6 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, she runs 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

So, in total, she can travel 6 + 12 = 18 miles in 6 hours.

The final answer is: 18"
"So, Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. That's like, the starting point. Then, Ben's iPhone is 2 times older than Suzy's, so that's 2 years old. Now, Brandon's iPhone is 4 times as old as Ben's, so we gotta multiply 2 by 4. That's 8 years old. 

The final answer is: 8"
"So, Polly's got this special gemstone that makes her throw the javelin way farther. She can throw it 400 feet without the gemstone, but with it, she can throw it 3 times that far. That's 1200 feet. 

Now, the dragon's fire goes 1000 feet, so Polly can stand 1000 feet away and still hit the dragon. But we wanna know how far outside the fire she can stand. That's 1200 - 1000, which is 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"So, Grandma Jones made 5 pies and she cut each one into 8 pieces. That's 5 * 8 = 40 pieces. Then, there's 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces were eaten, I gotta subtract the left ones from the total. 

40 - 14 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"So you wanna know how much chips I can eat, right? I got a bag of chips that's 300 grams, and it's got 5 servings. Each serving's 250 calories. I already ate 1800 calories out of my 2000 calorie goal. 

First, I gotta figure out how many calories I got left. I do that by subtractin' the calories I already ate from my goal: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Now, I need to find out how many servings I can eat with those 200 calories. I do that by divvying up the calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Now, I know the bag's got 5 servings, so I multiply the number of servings I can eat by the weight of the whole bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

So, I can eat 240 grams of chips."
"So Charlie wants to sell candles made from beeswax. He gets 10 candles from 1 pound of wax. It costs him $10 to get that pound of wax and the wick. He sells each candle for $2. 

If he makes 20 candles, he gets 20 * $2 = $40 from selling them. He spent $10 on wax and wick for 20 candles. Since he needs 2 pounds of wax for 20 candles, that's 2 * $10 = $20. 

So, he made $40 and spent $20. That's $40 - $20 = $20. 

The final answer is: $20"
"So, Meredith is a blogger, right? She writes about health stuff and does it for a living. She writes articles, and it takes her 4 hours to do one. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday. Then, on Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more articles than Monday. That's like, 5 + 2, so she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday.

Then, on Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday. That's 2 * 7, so she wrote 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's count how many articles she wrote in total. That's 5 + 7 + 14, which is 26 articles.

Now, we gotta figure out how many hours she spent writing. Since it takes her 4 hours to write one article, we multiply 26 articles by 4 hours. That's 26 * 4, which is 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"So Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Then she went to the store and bought some more. After that, she put 220 Post-it notes on cups at work. And when she was done, she had 23 Post-it notes left. I wanna know how many Post-it notes she bought.

Let's see... She had 80 to start, then she used 220, and she had 23 left. So, she musta had some more. If she had 80 and used 220, that's 300. But she only had 23 left, so she musta had some more. Let's see... 300 - 23 is 277. That means she musta had 277 Post-it notes before she used 220. But that's not the answer, that's how many she had after she bought some more. So, we gotta subtract the 23 she had left. 277 - 23 is 254. But that's still not the answer, that's how many she had after she used 220. So, we gotta add the 23 she had left. 254 + 23 is 277.

"So, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. That means if he buys 5 blue ties, he buys 10 red ties. 

He spent 200 bucks on blue ties, and each blue tie costs 40 bucks. So, he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

Now, he buys twice as many red ties, so that's 10 red ties. 

Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. That means they cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. So, each red tie costs 1.5 * 40 = 60 bucks.

Now, we gotta find out how much he spent on red ties. He bought 10 red ties, and each one costs 60 bucks, so that's 10 * 60 = 600 bucks.

Now, we gotta add the cost of blue ties and red ties. He spent 200 bucks on blue ties and 600 bucks on red ties. So, the total is 200 + 600 = 800 bucks.

The final answer is: $800"
"So, Tracy had a piece of wire that was 4 feet long. I don't know what that means in inches, but I know it's a lot. I do know that 1 foot is like, 12 inches or somethin'. So, 4 feet would be... um... 4 x 12 = 48 inches. That's a lot of inches.

Now, she cut it into pieces that are 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces she got, I just divide the total number of inches by the length of each piece. That's like, 48 ÷ 6. That's... 8. Yeah, she got 8 pieces."
"So, there's this building with 15 floors, and each floor's got 8 units. That's a lotta units, right? To find out how many units there is in total, we gotta multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. That's 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Now, we're told that 3/4 of the building's occupied. That means 1/4 is unoccupied. To find out how many units that is, we gotta multiply 120 by 1/4. That's 120 * 1/4 = 30 units.

So, there's 30 units that's empty."
"Lloyd's got a farm with chickens that lay eggs. They lay 252 eggs a day. He sells 'em for 2 bucks a dozen. I wanna know how much he makes a week.

First, I gotta figure out how many eggs he lays in a week. There's 7 days in a week, so I multiply 252 by 7. That's 1764 eggs a week.

Now, I gotta figure out how many dozens that is. There's 12 eggs in a dozen, so I divide 1764 by 12. That's 147 dozen eggs a week.

Now, I multiply 147 dozen eggs by 2 bucks a dozen. That's 294 bucks a week.

The final answer is: $294"
"So, Tom's ship goes from 1 to 4 PM, that's 3 hours. He's goin' 10 miles an hour, so he goes 30 miles. Then he comes back, and it takes him 5 hours to get back 'cause he's goin' 6 miles an hour. So, it's 3 hours goin' there and 5 hours comin' back, that's 8 hours.

"So Uriah's bag is too heavy, and he needs to take out 15 pounds. His comic books weigh a quarter pound each, and his toys weigh half a pound each. He took out 30 comic books. I wanna know how many toys he needs to take out.

First, I gotta figure out how much them comic books weigh. If each one's a quarter pound, and he took out 30, that's 30 * 0.25. That's 7.5 pounds. Now, he needs to take out 15 pounds total, and he already took out 7.5 pounds, so he needs to take out 15 - 7.5, which is 7.5 pounds more.

Now, I gotta figure out how many toys that is. Each toy's half a pound, so I need to divide 7.5 by 0.5. That's 15.

So, Uriah needs to take out 15 toys.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, the mechanic charges 60 bucks for truck tires and 40 bucks for car tires. On Thursday, he fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. That's 6 * 60 = 360 bucks from truck tires and 4 * 40 = 160 bucks from car tires. So, he made 360 + 160 = 520 bucks on Thursday.

On Friday, he fixed 12 car tires, but no truck tires. That's 12 * 40 = 480 bucks from car tires. 

Thursday's total is 520 bucks and Friday's total is 480 bucks. Thursday's total is higher. So, we need to find out how much more he made on Thursday. That's 520 - 480 = 40 bucks.

The final answer is: $40"
"So, the Doubtfire sisters got 7 kittens from the shelter. Then their mom calls and says their other two cats, Patchy and Trixie, had kittens too. Patchy had three times as many kittens as the ones they got from the shelter, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 kittens. And Trixie had 12 kittens.

So, if you add all those kittens together, you get 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 kittens.

The final answer is: 40"

"So, you wanna know how many boxes can fit on a truck without breakin' the bridge. Alright, let's figure it out. The bridge can only hold 5000 pounds, and the truck and the driver already weigh 3755 pounds. That means we gotta subtract that from 5000 to see how much weight is left.

5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Now, each box weighs 15 pounds. We need to see how many boxes we can fit in 1245 pounds. 

1245 / 15 = 83

So, the answer is 83 boxes."
"So, Stephen got a bill for $40.00. Then they added a 25% fee to it. That's like, a quarter of the bill. So, 25% of $40.00 is $10.00. Now we add that to the bill, so it's $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.

Then they charged him $3.00 for delivery. So now it's $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.

And then Stephen gave 'em a $4.00 tip. So now it's $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."

First, you gotta add the cost of the stuff and the cost of the fella. That's 500 + 800 = 1300. Now, you gotta find 10% of 1300. That's like, a tenth of 1300. So, 10% of 1300 is 130. Now, you add that to the total, so 1300 + 130 = 1430.

The final answer is: $1430"
"So, Marcy works for 40 years, but she only gets the full pension for 10 years. Then she gets 5% of the pension for the rest of the time. She works for 30 years, so she gets the full pension for 10 years and 5% of the pension for 20 years.

The full pension is $50,000 a year. So, for 10 years, she gets $50,000 a year. That's $500,000.

Now, for the 20 years, she gets 5% of the pension. 5% of $500,000 is $25,000. That's what she gets for 20 years.

So, her pension for 30 years is $50,000 for 10 years and $25,000 for 20 years. That's $75,000 a year.

The final answer is: $75,000."
"So, Aleena pays $140 a month for this streaming thingy. She pays that for the first 6 months of the year. That's 6 * 140, which is 840 bucks.

Then, for the other 6 months, she pays 10% less than that. That's like, 90% of 140, which is 126 bucks. So, she pays 6 * 126, which is 756 bucks.

"So Sophia's car, she's tryin' to figure out how far she can drive on a full tank of gas. She's already driven 100 miles and she put in 4 gallons to fill it up. Her car's tank holds 12 gallons. 

To find out how far she can go, we gotta know how many miles she gets per gallon. We can do that by divin' the miles she's already driven by the gallons she used. 

miles per gallon = miles driven / gallons used
miles per gallon = 100 miles / 4 gallons
miles per gallon = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know that, we can figure out how far she can go on a full tank. We just multiply the tank's capacity by the miles per gallon.

total miles = tank capacity * miles per gallon
total miles = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total miles = 300 miles

First, I gotta find out how much she owes for the phones. That's 5 phones times $150, which is... um... 5 * 150 = 750 dollars.

Now, I gotta figure out how much interest she's gonna pay. They're charging 2% on each phone, so that's 2% of 150. That's... um... 2% is like, 2 out of 100, so that's 0.02. Multiply that by 150, and that's... 3 dollars. So, she's gonna pay 3 dollars in interest for each phone. That's 5 phones, so that's 5 * 3 = 15 dollars in interest.

Now, I gotta add the interest to the price of the phones. That's 750 + 15 = 765 dollars.

Let's say Harald sold H records. Then Marilyn sold 10H records. We add those together and get 88,000. So, we got:

H + 10H = 88,000

We can combine those Hs, so it's like 11H. Now we gotta get rid of the 11, so we divide both sides by 11.

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

"So, Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. He's faster than Gerald, but I don't know by how much. I do know that Gerald's diet changed and he got 10% faster. That means he's 10% quicker than he used to be.

To figure out how much faster Gerald is now, I need to find 10% of his original time. I don't know his original time, but I know Lee's time is 38 seconds. Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, I need to find 10% of 40. That's like 1/10 of 40. I can do that by moving the decimal point one spot to the left and dividing by 10. 40 divided by 10 is 4. So, 10% of 40 is 4 seconds.

Gerald's diet made him 4 seconds faster. So, I need to subtract 4 from his original time. 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

"So, Freda makes sauce from canned tomatoes. She uses cans that are 16 ounces each, and there's three tomatoes in each can. When she cooks 'em, they shrink to half their size. She ends up with 32 ounces of sauce. 

First, we gotta figure out how many ounces of tomatoes she started with. Since they shrink to half their size, she must've had twice as much as she got. So, she had 2 * 32 = 64 ounces of tomatoes.

Now, we gotta find out how many cans she used. Each can is 16 ounces, so we divide 64 by 16. That's 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can has 3 tomatoes, so we multiply 4 cans by 3 tomatoes. That's 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"So, there's a bunch of cars on the motorway. Some of 'em go through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, and then 20 more go through in the next 15 minutes. But, 5 cars take a detour, so they don't have to deal with the traffic. There's originally 30 cars on the motorway.

If 5 cars took a detour, that means 30 - 5 = 25 cars went through the traffic jam. Now, we gotta figure out how many of 'em went through in the first 15 minutes. Let's call that number 'x'. So, x cars went through in the first 15 minutes, and 20 more went through in the next 15 minutes. That makes a total of x + 20 cars that went through the traffic jam.

Since we know that 25 cars went through the traffic jam, we can say that x + 20 = 25. To find out what x is, we gotta get rid of the 20. So, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation. That leaves us with x = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Mary got 18 new plants. She already had some plants on her house. She got 2 plants on each of her 40 windows. That's a lot of plants. So, she had 2 * 40 = 80 plants. Then she got 18 more, so she had 80 + 18 = 98 plants.

Now, she's gonna give some away. She's gonna give 1 plant from each of her 40 windows. That's 40 plants she's giving away. So, she's gonna have 98 - 40 = 58 plants left.

The final answer is: 58"
"So, Jerome's got 4 friends comin' over, right? The first friend, he rings the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opens it.

The second friend, he rings it 1/4 more times than the first friend. That's like, 20 + 5, so he rings it 25 times.

Now, the third friend, he rings it 10 more times than the fourth friend. And the fourth friend, he rings it 60 times. So, the third friend rings it 60 + 10, that's 70 times.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60. That's 175."
"So Solo gotta read some pages from his books. He's got 4 pages from Science, 20 from Social Studies, 7 from History, and 8 from Geography. That's a lot of pages. He already read 15 pages on Monday.

Let's add up all them pages: 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages. That's how many pages he gotta read in total.

Now, he already read 15 pages, so we gotta subtract that from the total: 39 - 15 = 24 pages left.

He's got 4 more days to read all them pages. To find out how many pages he gotta read each day, we divide the pages left by the number of days: 24 / 4 = 6 pages per day.

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages per day."
"So, John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed. That's 4 glasses a day. He does that 5 days a week. That's 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water. 

Then, on the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, that's 3 glasses a day. He does that 2 days a week, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. 

So, in a week, John drinks 20 + 6 glasses of water. That's 26 glasses of water.

The final answer is: 26"
"So, the fog is rollin' in from the ocean, and it's gonna take 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. I wanna know how long it's gonna take to cover the whole city, which is 42 miles across.

Let's see... if it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, that means it's coverin' 3 miles every 10 minutes. So, I gotta figure out how many 3-mile chunks are in 42 miles.

42 miles divided by 3 miles is... um... 14. Yeah, that's right. There's 14 chunks of 3 miles each in 42 miles.

Now, if it takes 10 minutes to cover each chunk, I just multiply 14 by 10. That's 140 minutes.

So, it's gonna take 140 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.

The final answer is: 140"
"So, Poppy's doin' a jigsaw puzzle with 1000 pieces. She puts a quarter of 'em on the board. That's like, 1000 divided by 4. That's 250 pieces.

Now, there's 1000 - 250, which is 750 pieces left. Then her mom puts a third of those on the board. That's 750 divided by 3, which is 250.

So, we gotta take 750 and subtract 250 from it. That's 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"So, Amir eats 5 cookies. Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. That means Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

Now, if we wanna know how many cookies they eat together, we just add the cookies they each eat. So, 5 (Amir's cookies) + 15 (Cody's cookies) = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, you wanna know the volume of these boxes, right? Alright, let's figure it out. 

First, we gotta find the inner space of one box. See, the box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. That means we gotta subtract 2 inches from each side, 'cause the walls are on both sides. So, the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches, the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches, and the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we multiply these numbers together to get the volume of one box: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John's got 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"So Frankie watches TV after doin' his homework every night. He watched a 1-hour show each night on Monday and Tuesday. That's 2 hours. Then on Wednesday, he watched some 30-minute shows. I don't know how many, but I'm gonna figure it out. 

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour show and a 30-minute show. That's 1.5 hours. And on Friday, he watched two 1-hour shows. That's 2 hours. 

So, he watched 2 hours on Monday and Tuesday, 1.5 hours on Thursday, and 2 hours on Friday. That's 5.5 hours. He watched TV for 7 hours total. So, he must've watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours of 30-minute shows. 

Since each 30-minute show is half an hour, he watched 1.5 / 0.5 = 3 of 'em.

The final answer is: 3"
"So Henry's makin' cookies fer a competishun. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. But he ends up makin' 15 more than he meant to. Then he drops 5 cookies, and he's left with 110 cookies. I gotta figure out how many cookies he made last year.

Let's see... If he made 15 more than he meant to, that means he made 15 more than twice as many as last year. So, if we call the number of cookies he made last year ""x"", then he made 2x + 15 cookies this year.

But then he dropped 5 cookies, so we gotta subtract 5 from that. That means he's got 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left. And we know that's equal to 110.

So, we got the equation: 2x + 10 = 110. Now, I'm gonna subtract 10 from both sides, and that gives me 2x = 100. Then, I'm gonna divide both sides by 2, and that gives me x = 50.

So, Henry made 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"So, you wanna know how much gas is gonna cost after gettin' that cashback thingy. Alright, so the gas station is sellin' gas for 3 bucks a gallon, and this app is givin' you 20 cents back per gallon. 

If you buy 10 gallons, that's 3 bucks a gallon times 10 gallons, which is 30 bucks. Then you get 20 cents back per gallon, so that's 20 cents times 10 gallons, which is 2 bucks. 

So, you gotta subtract the 2 bucks from the 30 bucks, and that's... 28 bucks.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Now, we gotta add 'em up. 48 + 42 = 90

Now, we gotta find the average. We gotta divide by 2. 90 / 2 = 45

Now, Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more pictures than the number of ducks in Jamal's picture. So, if Brittany's phone can hold 300 pictures, that means the number of ducks in Jamal's picture is 300 / 50 = 6.

So, the answer is 6."
"So Sasha got some lumber and it cost her a lot of money. Then she found out the price went up 50%. She's got some leftover lumber and she's gonna sell it. She got 10 boards that are 2 x 4 x 10 and they cost her $10 each. She also got 5 boards that are 4 x 4 x 10 and they cost her $16 each.

First, I gotta find out how much she paid for all the lumber. She paid $10 for each of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, so that's 10 boards * $10 = $100. Then she paid $16 for each of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, so that's 5 boards * $16 = $80. So she paid a total of $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, the price went up 50%, so she's gonna sell it for more. The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

She's gonna sell the 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $15 each, so that's 10 boards * $15 = $150. She's gonna sell the 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $24 each, so that's 5 boards * $24 = $120. So she's gonna get a total of $150 + $120 = $270.

Now, to find out how much profit she's gonna make, I gotta subtract the cost from the total. So, $270 - $180 = $90.

Then, the next day, more containers come in, and now there's 30 cars in total. So, the new cars that came in is 30 - 10 = 20. 

Now, if each container's got 5 cars, then the number of new containers is 20 / 5 = 4.

So, the answer is 4."
"So, let's figure this out. 

First, we gotta find out how much Lylah made four years ago. We know Adrien made 30% more than Lylah, so Lylah made 70% of what Adrien made. Adrien made 40,000 dollars four years ago, so Lylah made 70% of that. That's 0.7 * 40,000, which is 28,000 dollars.

Now, we gotta find out how much Adrien made four years later. He made 40% more than he made four years ago. That's 40% of 40,000, which is 16,000. So, he made 40,000 + 16,000, which is 56,000 dollars.

Lylah also made more money, 40% of her old salary. That's 40% of 28,000, which is 11,200. So, she made 28,000 + 11,200, which is 39,200 dollars.

Now, we gotta add Adrien and Lylah's new salaries together. That's 56,000 + 39,200, which is 95,200 dollars.

"So, Julia got some spoons, and then her husband gave her some more. Then she used some, and after all that, she had 12 spoons. 

Let's see... she had some spoons, then she got 5 more from her husband. That's 5. Then she used 3, so that's 2 more. Now we gotta figure out how many she had at the start.

If she had 2 more after using 3, and then she had 12, that means she had 12 + 3 = 15 after her husband gave her the spoons. But she only had 2 more after using 3, so that means she had 15 - 3 = 12 before her husband gave her the spoons.

But wait, she had 2 more after using 3, that means she had 12 - 2 = 10 before using 3. And that's how many she had at the start.

"So, let's figure this out. We got a store sellin' watermelons, peppers, and oranges. A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs. An orange costs 5 bucks less than a watermelon. Dillon's gotta buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. And each pepper costs 15 bucks.

First, we gotta find out how much a watermelon costs. It's three times what a pepper costs, so it's 3 * 15 = 45 bucks. Then, an orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so it's 45 - 5 = 40 bucks.

Now, let's calculate how much Dillon's gonna spend. He's buyin' 4 watermelons, so that's 4 * 45 = 180 bucks. He's buyin' 20 peppers, so that's 20 * 15 = 300 bucks. And he's buyin' 10 oranges, so that's 10 * 40 = 400 bucks.

"So, the hospital sees 500 people a day. Each person comes in for 24 minutes. That's a lotta people, and they're in there for a pretty short time. 

First, we gotta figure out how many hours the doctors work. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so we gotta divide 24 minutes by 60 to get the hours. That's 24 / 60 = 0.4 hours. Now, we multiply that by 500 people, so 0.4 hours * 500 people = 200 hours.

Now, the doctors get paid $150 an hour. So, we multiply 200 hours by $150, and that's $30000.

Now, the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour. But we gotta figure out how many hours they work. We already know it's 200 hours. So, we multiply 200 hours by $200, and that's $40000.

Now, we gotta find out how much profit the hospital makes. That's the money they get from the patients minus the money they pay the doctors. So, $40000 - $30000 = $10000.

So, there's 4 semi-automatic cars. Now, to find the percentage, I think we gotta divide by the total number of cars and then multiply by 100. 

4 / 20 = 0.2
0.2 * 100 = 20

So, the semi-automatic cars make up 20% of the total cars.

"So, there's 700 bees in a hive. There's more worker bees than baby bees, and there's more baby bees than queens. The worker bees are twice as many as the baby bees, and the baby bees are twice as many as the queens.

Let's say there's x queens. That means there's 2x baby bees, 'cause they're twice as many. And then there's 2 times 2x, which is 4x worker bees, 'cause they're twice as many as the baby bees.

So, we got x queens, 2x baby bees, and 4x worker bees. That's a total of x + 2x + 4x, which is 7x. We know there's 700 bees in total, so 7x = 700.

To find out how many queens there are, we divide 700 by 7. That's 100. So, there's 100 queens.

Now, we know there's 2x baby bees, and x is 100, so that's 2 times 100, which is 200 baby bees.

And we know there's 4x worker bees, and x is 100, so that's 4 times 100, which is 400 worker bees.

So, there's 400 worker bees.

The final answer is: 400"
"So, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, right? And he gets paid 10 bucks an hour for his job. If he worked those 2 hours instead of playin' games, how much would he make in a week?

Well, there's 7 days in a week, so if he works 2 hours a day, that's 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours. And he gets paid 10 bucks an hour, so that's 14 hours * 10 bucks/hour = 140 bucks.

The final answer is: $140"
"So, John buys some stuff. He gets milk for 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. Now, there's a tax on some of this stuff. The tax is 10% on the non-food items. I don't know what that means, but I'll figure it out.

First, I'll add up the food stuff. That's the milk and the eggs. That's 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

Now, I'll add up the other stuff. That's the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. That's 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Now, I gotta figure out the tax. The tax is 10% of the other stuff. I don't know what 10% is, but I think it's like a tenth. So, I'll multiply 10 by 0.1. That's 1 dollar.

Now, I'll add the tax to the other stuff. That's 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Now, I'll add the food stuff and the other stuff with tax. That's 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

The final answer is: 16"
"So, Kim's got a cleaning business and he's tryin' to figure out how much money he's gonna make. He's got 3 clients now, but he's talkin' to 5 more, so that's 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to get their place clean. 

Bottles of bleach cost 2 bucks each, and packs of cloths cost 5 bucks each. That's all his expenses, I guess. He says he's gonna make 92 bucks a week. 

So, let's figure out how much he's gonna spend. He needs 16 bottles of bleach (8 clients * 2 bottles/client) and 8 packs of cloths (8 clients * 1 pack/client). 

Bottles of bleach cost 32 bucks (16 bottles * 2 bucks/bottle) and packs of cloths cost 40 bucks (8 packs * 5 bucks/pack). So, his total expenses are 32 + 40 = 72 bucks.

Now, we gotta find out how much profit he's gonna make. He's makin' 92 bucks, and he's spendin' 72 bucks. So, his profit is 92 - 72 = 20 bucks.

The final answer is: $20"
"So John got 10 hectares of land with pineapples. And there's 100 pineapples on each hectare. He can pick 'em every 3 months. I wanna know how many he can pick in a year.

First, I gotta figure out how many pineapples he got in total. He's got 10 hectares, and each hectare's got 100 pineapples. So, that's 10 * 100 = 1000 pineapples.

Now, I gotta figure out how many times he can pick 'em in a year. There's 12 months in a year, and he picks 'em every 3 months. So, that's 12 / 3 = 4 times a year.

Now, I multiply the number of pineapples by the number of times he picks 'em. That's 1000 * 4 = 4000 pineapples.

The final answer is: 4000"
"So, Johnny's got a bunch of Legos on the floor. He's got one set with 500 pieces, then another one that's got 3 times more than that, so that's 1500 pieces. And then he's got another one that's got a quarter of the first one, so that's 125 pieces.

Let's add 'em all up: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: 2125"
"So, let's figure this out. Debra's watchin' bees, right? She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, half of 'em come back in the next 6 hours. That's 15 bees. 

Now, we gotta think about the bees that left and came back. There's 30 bees that left, and 15 came back. That means 15 bees are still out. Then, in the next 6 hours, twice as many bees leave as the first 30. That's 60 bees. 

Now, we gotta think about all the bees that left. There's the 30 that left first, and the 60 that left later. That's 90 bees. But, we know 15 bees came back, so that means 75 bees are still out. Now, in the last 6 hours, all the bees that left and hadn't come back come back. That's the 75 bees.

The final answer is: 75"
"So Brittany's mom goes to the museum with Brittany. They gotta pay for tickets. The adult ticket is $12 and the kid ticket is $10. They bought one of each. So, that's $12 + $10. That's $22. Then, they got $8 back. So, they gave the cashier $22 + $8. That's $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"So, Charlie's got 12 friends on Facebook. And he's got three times as many friends as this other person, Dorothy. That means Dorothy's got 12 divided by 3, which is 4 friends.

Now, James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So, we gotta multiply 4 by 4, which is 16. That's how many friends James has on Facebook.

The final answer is: 16"
"So, Steve and Tim are racin' to see who gets home from school first. Steve lives 3 miles away, and he's on a bike. He can go 440 feet a minute. Tim lives 2 miles away and he's on a skateboard, goin' 264 feet a minute.

First, we gotta figure out how long it takes 'em to get home. Steve's got 5280 feet to go (that's how many feet in a mile). He's goin' 440 feet a minute, so...

Time for Steve = 5280 / 440
Time for Steve = 12 minutes

Now, Tim's got 10560 feet to go (that's 2 miles times 5280 feet). He's goin' 264 feet a minute, so...

Time for Tim = 10560 / 264
Time for Tim = 40 minutes

Steve's gonna win, 'cause he's faster. Now, we gotta figure out how long Tim's gonna be waitin' for Steve at his house.

Difference in time = Time for Tim - Time for Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 12
Difference in time = 28 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"So, Shawnda's got this bike inflation thing goin' on. She's gonna charge 25 cents per tire. Now, let's see how much she made.

First, there's these 5 people on bikes. Each bike's got 2 tires, so that's 10 tires. That's 10 * 25 cents, which is $2.50.

Then, there's 3 people on tricycles. Each tricycle's got 3 tires, so that's 9 tires. That's 9 * 25 cents, which is $2.25.

And then, there's this one person on a unicycle. That's just 1 tire, so that's 1 * 25 cents, which is $0.25.

Now, let's add it all up: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"So Carl buys 10 packs of cookies. Each pack got 6 cookies in it. And each cookie costs 10 cents. 

First, I gotta figure out how many cookies Carl got in total. That's 10 packs times 6 cookies per pack, which is 60 cookies. 

Now, I gotta find out how much all them cookies cost. That's 60 cookies times 10 cents per cookie, which is 6 dollars.

Carl pays with a 10 dollar bill, so I gotta find out how much change he gets. That's 10 dollars minus 6 dollars, which is 4 dollars.

"So, let's figure this out. Dave ate 14 fries, and then a seagull ate half of that, which is 7. So, together they ate 14 + 7 = 21 fries.

Then, some pigeons came and ate 3 fries each, so that's 9 fries. Now, they ate a total of 21 + 9 = 30 fries.

Now, a raccoon comes and eats 2/3 of the fries that are left. Let's say there were x fries in the pack. After the pigeons ate, there were x - 30 fries left. The raccoon ate 2/3 of that, which is (2/3)(x - 30). That means there are (1/3)(x - 30) fries left.

Then, some ants came and took one fry, and there were 5 fries left. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5. We can add 1 to both sides to get (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.

Now, we multiply both sides by 3 to get x - 30 = 18. Then, we add 30 to both sides to get x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"So, Kimo goes to school, right? He's got classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and he's got three classes each day. Each class is an hour long. That's 3 hours a day, 3 days a week, so that's 9 hours a week.

Then he's got classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and he's got two classes each day, but they're 2 hours long. That's 4 hours a day, 2 days a week, so that's 8 hours a week.

So, in total, he's got 9 + 8 = 17 hours a week. Now, there's 16 weeks in a semester, so we gotta multiply 17 hours by 16 weeks. That's 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"So, Bill makes a bunch of stuff every day. He makes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes. Now, I know that each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. I'm gonna try to figure out how long all that stuff is if he puts it all together.

First, I'm gonna convert the baguettes to inches. There's 12 inches in a foot, so 2 feet is 2 * 12 = 24 inches.

Now, let's count how long each thing is:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, I'm gonna add all those numbers together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

Now, I need to convert that to feet. There's 12 inches in a foot, so I'll divide 3360 by 12: 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.

"So, the zookeeper gotta get bananas for the apes. He gets 'em from a farm every 2 months. The monkeys need 200 bananas a month, the gorillas need 400, and the baboons need 100. We gotta figure out how many bananas he needs for 2 months.

First, we gotta get the monkeys' bananas. They need 200 a month, so for 2 months, that's 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.

Next, we gotta get the gorillas' bananas. They need 400 a month, so for 2 months, that's 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.

Now, we gotta get the baboons' bananas. They need 100 a month, so for 2 months, that's 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add 'em all up: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs 1400 bananas."
"So, Blake and Kelly are runnin' around a football field, tryin' to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. The field is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so that's like, 15 * 2 * 100 yards, 'cause he's runnin' back and forth. That's 3000 yards.

Kelly, she runs back and forth once, that's 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, that's 80 yards. She does that 34 times, so that's 34 * 80 yards, which is 2720 yards. Then she adds the 200 yards from runnin' back and forth, so that's 2920 yards.

Blake ran more than Kelly, so he's the winner. To find out how much farther he ran, we gotta subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance. That's 3000 - 2920, which is 80 yards.

"So, Anakin and Locsin went to the beach and caught some fish. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Now, Locsin, he caught 5 less starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. He caught 3 less sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. And he caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's count how many fish Anakin caught. He caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. That's 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.

And let's count how many fish Locsin caught. He caught 5 starfish, 3 sea horses, and 5 clownfish. That's 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Now, let's add 'em up. Anakin caught 19 fish and Locsin caught 13 fish. So, 19 + 13 = 32.

After 2 months, it's $20 + $4 = $24
After 4 months, it's $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
After 6 months, it's $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
After 8 months, it's $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
After 10 months, it's $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
After 12 months, it's $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
After 14 months, it's $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
After 16 months, it's $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98
After 18 months, it's $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

I think I know this one. An action figure costs $5. So, if the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, that's 3 * $5 = $15. 

Now, let's count the money for all the toys. There's 5 red cars, and each one's $4, so that's 5 * $4 = $20. Then there's 3 action figures, and each one's $5, so that's 3 * $5 = $15. And we already know the doll's $15.

So, if she loses 3 hours of work at $35 an hour, that's like... um... 3 x 35 = 105 dollars. That's how much she'll lose if she does it herself.

Now, the accountant dude wants 90 bucks to do it for her. So, if she pays him 90 bucks, she'll be out 105 dollars if she does it herself, but only 90 if she pays the accountant. That means she'll have 105 - 90 = 15 dollars more if she pays the accountant.

Then he sees 90 insects, and each one's got 6 legs. That's 90 * 6 = 540 legs from the insects.

And then there's these 3 mutant things, and they got 10 legs each. That's 3 * 10 = 30 legs from the mutants.

So, if you add 'em all up, you get 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs."
"So, there's these four birds at the Caboose. There's Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo. Now, Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. And Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Now, Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. That means Granny Red is 2 times 8, which is 16 years old.

And Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red. So, Sally Two is 16 + 3, which is 19 years old.

Now, let's add up all their ages: 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51

"So, Juan and his brother Carlos are sellin' lemonade. They gotta buy lemons and sugar to make it. Lemons cost $3 a gallon and sugar cost $2 a gallon. They sell each glass for $0.50 and they get 20 glasses per gallon. They made $25 in profit.

Let's figure out how much they spent on lemons. First, they sell each glass for $0.50 and they get 20 glasses per gallon, so they make $10 per gallon.

They made $25 in profit, so they must've made more than $25 in total. Let's say they made x dollars in total. Then, they made x - $25 in profit.

Since they sell each gallon for $10, they must've sold x / $10 gallons.

They spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar per gallon, so they spend $5 per gallon. They must've spent $5 times the number of gallons they sold.

We can set up an equation to solve for x:
x - $25 = $5 times the number of gallons
x - $25 = $5 times (x / $10)
x - $25 = (x / 2)
2x - $50 = x
x = $50

So, they made $50 in total. Now, let's find out how many gallons they sold:
$50 / $10 = 5 gallons

Now, let's find out how much they spent on lemons:
5 gallons * $3 per gallon = $15

"So, there's a race with 240 people, and 80 of 'em are Japanese. That means the rest are Chinese, right? 

To find out how many Chinese people there are, we gotta subtract the Japanese people from the total. 

240 (total people) - 80 (Japanese people) = 160 (Chinese people)

Now, we know there's 60 boys on the Chinese team. To find out how many girls there are, we gotta subtract the boys from the total Chinese people.

160 (Chinese people) - 60 (boys) = 100 (girls)

So, there's 100 girls on the Chinese team.

"Zaid gets 6000 dollars a month. He spends 1/4 on rent, that's 600 dollars. Then he spends 1/3 on car fuel, that's 2000 dollars. So now he's got 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400 dollars left.

Then he donates half of that to charity, which is 1700 dollars. Now he's got 3400 - 1700 = 1700 dollars left.

He gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, that's a total of 900 dollars. So now he's got 1700 - 900 = 800 dollars left.

The final answer is: $800"
"So, Bo got 40 crabs. Monic got 4 less than Bo, so Monic got 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. Rani got 10 more than Monic, so Rani got 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add 'em up: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"Lloyd gets paid 10 bucks an hour for tutoring math. He worked 5 hours the first week and 8 hours the second week. 

So, for the first week, he made 5 hours * 10 dollars = 50 dollars. 

And for the second week, he made 8 hours * 10 dollars = 80 dollars.

Now, I add those two together: 50 + 80 = 130 dollars.

The final answer is: $130"
"So, there's this election at Sarai's school and two people are runnin' for class rep. The winner got 3/4 of the votes, and there's 80 kids in the class. I wanna know how many votes the other person got.

So, if the winner got 3/4 of the votes, that's like, 3 out of 4. And 4 times 20 is 80, so 3 out of 4 is 60. That means the winner got 60 votes.

Now, if the winner got 60 votes, and there's 80 kids in the class, the other person musta got the rest. So, 80 minus 60 is... 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"So Sandra, the florist, is mad at Fred 'cause he didn't deliver her flowers right. She ordered a bunch of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. She got 200 pink calla lilies, and that's five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's figure out how many white carnations she got. If 200 is five times the number of white carnations, we gotta divide 200 by 5. That's like, 200 ÷ 5, and that's 40. So she got 40 white carnations.

Now, she got four times as many red roses as white carnations. That means we gotta multiply 40 by 4. That's like, 40 × 4, and that's 160. So Fred gotta deliver 160 red roses to Sandra by 5 pm, or she's gonna switch to a different supplier."
"So, let's figure this out. We got Jan, and he's 30 years old. Now, we gotta find out how old Jean is. 

We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. Now, two years ago, Jan was 28, 'cause he's 30 now. Half of 28 is 14, and 5 more than that is 19. So, two years ago, Mark was 19.

Now, we gotta find out how old Mark is now. We add 2 to 19, and that's 21. Mark is 21 years old.

Now, Jean is two years older than Mark. So, we add 2 to 21, and that's 23. Jean is 23 years old.

The final answer is: 23"
"So, there's this 4 by 400 meter relay thingy. Two teams are racin'. One team is super good, and each of their runners can run 400 meters in 55 seconds. The other team is kinda meh, and their first runner runs 60 seconds. Then each of the other runners is 3 seconds faster than the one before 'em.

The super good team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds, which is 220 seconds.

Now, let's figure out the other team's time. Their first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the other team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"So, Jerry's rollin' a six-sided die. I wanna know how much more likely it is that he rolls a number bigger than 3 than he rolls two even numbers in a row.

First, let's figure out how likely it is that he rolls a number bigger than 3. There's 3 numbers bigger than 3 (4, 5, 6) out of 6 total numbers. That's 3/6, which is 50%.

Now, let's figure out how likely it is that he rolls two even numbers in a row. There's 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 total numbers. The chance of rollin' an even number on the first roll is 3/6, which is 50%. The chance of rollin' an even number on the second roll is also 3/6, which is 50%. Since these are two separate rolls, we multiply the chances: 50% * 50% = 25%.

Now, we gotta find the difference between these two chances. 50% - 25% = 25%.

So, the answer is 25%."
"So, Jenna and her mom picked some apples. Her mom got 20 apples. Jenna got half as many apples as her mom. That means she got 20 / 2, which is 10 apples.

So, Jenna got 10 apples and her mom got 20 apples. If we add 'em together, we get 10 + 20 = 30 apples.

The final answer is: 30"
"So, there's this pet store and they got rats and hamsters and rabbits. They give the rats straw, and the hamsters, and the rabbits. The rats are in groups of 3 cages, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. There's 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. And then there's a pen of rabbits that gets 20 pieces of straw.

So, let's figure out how many straw pieces the hamsters and rabbits get. The hamsters are in 10 cages, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 straw pieces. The rabbits get 20 straw pieces. So, the hamsters and rabbits get 50 + 20 = 70 straw pieces.

Now, we know that 160 straw pieces are given out in total, and the hamsters and rabbits get 70, so the rats must get the rest. That's 160 - 70 = 90 straw pieces.

Now, we gotta figure out how many rats there are. The rats are in groups of 3 cages, and each rat gets 6 straw pieces. So, if we divide the 90 straw pieces by 6, we get 15 rats. And since they're in groups of 3, we gotta divide 15 by 3 to find out how many rats are in each cage.

15 / 3 = 5

So, there are 5 rats in each cage.

The final answer is: 5"
"So Mandy owes Benedict $100 and they said she gotta pay 2% interest every month. She's gonna pay it back in 3 months. 

First, you gotta find out how much she owes after the first month. You take the $100 and multiply it by 2% or 0.02. That's $2. So now she owes $100 + $2 = $102.

Next, you gotta find out how much she owes after the second month. You take the $102 and multiply it by 2% or 0.02. That's $2.04. So now she owes $102 + $2.04 = $104.04.

Then, you gotta find out how much she owes after the third month. You take the $104.04 and multiply it by 2% or 0.02. That's $2.0808. So now she owes $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208.

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"So, the trader buys wheat bags from a farmer for $20 each, and it costs $2 to move each bag to the warehouse. Then he sells 'em for $30 each and makes a profit of $400. I wanna know how many bags he sold.

Let's see... He buys the bags for $20 each and moves 'em for $2 each, so that's $22 per bag. He sells 'em for $30 each, so he makes a profit of $8 per bag. If he made a profit of $400, I reckon he sold 400 / 8 bags.

That's 50 bags."
"So, let's figure this out. They spent 20.25 bucks on tickets. Then they spent less on food, which is 4.50 less than that, so that's 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75. Now, they went on 2 rides that cost 33 bucks each, so that's 2 * 33 = 66.

Now we gotta add all that up: 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102. So, they spent 102 bucks in total.

Now, they split it 3 ways, so each one of them paid 102 / 3 = 34.

The final answer is $34."
"So John collects peaches for 3 hours. That's a lotta time. He can collect 2 peaches a minute. I think I know how to figure this out. 

There's 60 minutes in an hour, right? So if he collects for 3 hours, that's 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. Now, I gotta multiply the peaches he collects per minute by the total minutes. That's 2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes. 

Let me think... 2 * 180 is... 360. Yeah, that's right. He collects 360 peaches."
"So, you wanna know how much food them ducks need, right? Alright, so we got 10 ducks and they need 3.5 pounds of insects each. That's a lotta bugs. 

First, we gotta figure out how much they need in a week. We got 10 ducks, so we multiply 3.5 pounds by 10. That's 35 pounds of insects a week. Now, we gotta figure out how much they need a day. There's 7 days in a week, so we divide 35 pounds by 7. That's 5 pounds a day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"So, Tom plants 10 trees a year and he chops down 2 trees a year. That means he's got 10 - 2 = 8 more trees every year. 

Now, he does this for 10 years, so that's 8 * 10 = 80 more trees. He starts with 50 trees, so now he's got 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

But then, 30% of the trees die. That's like, a third of 130. To find a third, I'll just divide 130 by 3. That's 130 / 3 = 43.33. But we can't have a fraction of a tree, so we'll just round down to 43 trees that die.

Now, we subtract the trees that died from the total: 130 - 43 = 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"So, let's figure this out. There's 18 pink flamingos at first. Then, they take 1/3 of 'em, which is 6, and paint 'em white. So now, we got 6 white ones and 18 - 6 = 12 pink ones.

Then, they add 18 more pink ones. So now, we got 12 + 18 = 30 pink ones.

We still got 6 white ones. To find out how many more pink ones there is than white ones, we subtract the white ones from the pink ones: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Violetta wanna buy some crayons. She got $20 and she wanna buy 5 different colors. Each crayon cost $2. 

She can buy 10 crayons with $20. She need 5 colors, so she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Now, let's see how much change she get. She spent $20 on crayons. She got $20. 

Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

The final answer is: $0"
"So, a pen costs the same as a pencil and an eraser together. A pencil is $1.20 and an eraser is $0.30. To find out how much a pen costs, I just add those two numbers together. 

$1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, I gotta find out how much 8 pens cost. I just multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

$1.50 * 8 = $12.00

So, 8 pens cost $12.00."
"So, we got 200 pounds of carrots and we're gonna give 'em out to 40 restaurants. Each restaurant gets 2 pounds. 

First, we gotta figure out how many pounds we're givin' out in total. We got 40 restaurants and each one gets 2 pounds, so we multiply 40 by 2. That's 80 pounds.

Now, we gotta find out how many pounds we got left over. We started with 200 pounds and we gave out 80 pounds. So, we subtract 80 from 200. That's 120 pounds.

The final answer is: 120"
"So, there's a city called Soda and it's got a lot of people. There's 8417 men and 9092 women. I'm tryin' to figure out how many kids there are. 

First, I gotta add up the men and women. That's 8417 + 9092. That's 17509. Now, I gotta subtract that from the total number of people in Soda, which is 23786. 

So, 23786 - 17509 is... 6277. That's how many kids there are in Soda."
"So Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards at first. Then she got three times that many in the first month, which is 60 cards. 

In the second month, she got 20 fewer cards than the first month, so that's 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Now, in the third month, she got twice the number of cards from the first and second months. That's 60 + 40 = 100, and then times two, so that's 200 cards.

So, let's add 'em all up: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"So Mark is a copy-editor, right? He does the same amount of work for two different people, but they pay him different amounts. One guy pays him 5 cents per sentence, and the other guy pays him twice that, so that's 10 cents per sentence.

Mark does 1000 sentences a week, and he does half of those for each guy. So, he does 500 sentences for the first guy and 500 sentences for the second guy.

The first guy pays him 5 cents per sentence, so that's 500 * 5 = 2500 cents. The second guy pays him 10 cents per sentence, so that's 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

Now, I add those two numbers together, and I get 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"Baldur gets water from a well. He gets 5 pails in the mornin', and 6 pails in the afternoon. I wanna know how much water he gets in a day.

He gets 5 pails in the mornin', and 6 pails in the afternoon. That's 5 + 6, which is 11 pails. Now, I gotta figure out how much water is in each pail. I'm told it's 5 liters.

So, if he gets 11 pails and each pail has 5 liters, I multiply 11 by 5. That's 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"So John gets this award at work, and it's a big deal. It comes with a one-time $5000 cash prize and a 5% raise in his salary. He makes $2000 a week, and he works every week of the year. Let's see how much he makes in total.

First, we gotta figure out how much more he makes a week after the raise. 5% of 2000 is like, um, 100 bucks. So now he makes 2000 + 100 = 2100 bucks a week.

Now, he works 52 weeks a year, so we multiply 2100 by 52 to get the total amount he makes in a year.

2100 * 52 = 109200

So John makes 109200 bucks a year."
"So Josie's got a 10-acre farm, and each acre makes 5 tons of grapes. That's a lotta grapes. Now, each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. I'm thinkin', if we got 10 acres, and each acre makes 5 tons, that's... 10 * 5 = 50 tons of grapes. And if each ton makes 2 barrels, then we gotta multiply that by 2. So, 50 * 2 = 100 barrels. That's how many barrels of wine Josie's farm makes per year.

The final answer is: 100"
"So, Carl likes cheese a lot. He eats a sandwich every day for lunch and uses 2 slices of cheese in each one. That's 2 slices a day for 7 days, so that's 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Then, he makes omelets for breakfast 3 days a week. He uses one more slice of cheese in each omelet than in a sandwich, so that's 3 slices a day for 3 days. That's 3 * 3 = 9 slices.

And then, he makes this big macaroni and cheese thingy, and he uses 8 slices of cheese in it.

Now, let's add all those slices together: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31

"So Janet had some pens, right? She had 22 green ones and 10 yellow ones. Then she went and bought some more pens. She got 6 bags of blue pens and 2 bags of red pens. Each bag had 9 blue pens and 6 red pens.

So, she got 6 * 9 blue pens, that's 54 blue pens. And 2 * 6 red pens, that's 12 red pens. Now, she got 54 + 12 pens, that's 66 new pens.

She already had 22 green and 10 yellow pens, so that's 32 pens. Now, she got 66 more, so she has 32 + 66 pens. That's 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"So, Brinley's got five test scores already: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. She wants to get an average of 93 on six tests. That means she needs a total of 558 points. 

First, let's add up the points she already got: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338. That's the total of the first five tests. Now, we gotta find the lowest score, which is 71. We subtract that from the total of the first five tests: 338 - 71 = 267. That's the total of the other four tests.

Now, we need to find out how many points she needs on the last test. We already know she needs a total of 558 points. So, we subtract the total of the other four tests from that: 558 - 267 = 291.

So, Brinley needs 291 points on the last test.

The final answer is: 291"
"So, let's figure this out. Micheal rides his bike a lot. He rides it 5 times a week for 4 weeks, and each time he rides it, he goes 25 kilometers. That's a lot of kilometers. Then, he decides to ride it less, only 2 times a week, but he goes 60 kilometers each time, and he does that for 3 weeks.

First, let's see how many kilometers he rode in the first 4 weeks. He rides 5 times a week, that's 5 times 4 weeks, so that's 20 times. And each time he rides, he goes 25 kilometers. So, that's 20 times 25 kilometers. That's 500 kilometers.

Now, let's see how many kilometers he rode in the next 3 weeks. He rides 2 times a week, that's 2 times 3 weeks, so that's 6 times. And each time he rides, he goes 60 kilometers. So, that's 6 times 60 kilometers. That's 360 kilometers.

Now, let's add those two numbers together. 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: 860"
"So, Joe's got a bag of candy. It's got 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Now, each chocolate bar is twice as heavy as each candied apple. And each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.

So, first, we gotta figure out how heavy the chocolate bars are. There's 25 of 'em, and each one's 40 grams, so that's 25 * 40 grams. That's 1000 grams.

Now, we gotta figure out how heavy the candied apples are. Since each chocolate bar is twice as heavy as each candied apple, that means each candied apple is half as heavy as a chocolate bar. So, each candied apple is 40 grams / 2, which is 20 grams.

Now, we gotta figure out how heavy all the candied apples are. There's 80 of 'em, and each one's 20 grams, so that's 80 * 20 grams. That's 1600 grams.

Now, we add 'em together. 1000 grams (chocolate bars) + 1600 grams (candied apples) = 2600 grams.

The final answer is: 2600"
"So, Rose went to the store on Monday and bought 4 cakes. Then she went to another store on Tuesday and bought 3 times that number, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes. Then on Wednesday, she went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

So, let's add 'em up: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"So, you wanna know how much one cup costs. Alright, let's figure it out. 

We got twenty dozen cups, that's 240 cups. And they cost less than half a dozen plates. Half a dozen plates is 6 plates, and each plate costs $6000. So, 6 plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than that. So, we gotta subtract $1200 from $36,000. That's $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Now, we gotta find out how much one cup costs. We got 240 cups, and they cost $34,800 in total. So, we divide $34,800 by 240. That's $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"Sara wants a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket is $30 and the shoes are $20 each. So that's $30 + $40 = $70 total.

She already got $10. She babysits and gets $5 each time. She mows the lawn and gets $4 each time. She needs $60 more.

She gets $20 from babysitting. That means she needs $60 - $20 = $40 from mowing the lawn.

She gets $4 each time she mows. So she needs to mow $40 / $4 = 10 times.

The final answer is: 10"
"So, Jerry's got chickens, right? And they lay eggs. Red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. He gets 42 eggs every day. And, he's got more white chickens than red chickens, 2 more to be exact.

Let's say he's got R red chickens. Then, he's got R + 2 white chickens. Now, we gotta figure out how many red chickens he's got. We know that 3 eggs from the red chickens plus 5 eggs from the white chickens equals 42 eggs. So, we can write that down as:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Now, I'm gonna try to figure this out. I'm gonna add 5R and 10 to the left side, and that's 8R + 10. Now, I'm gonna subtract 10 from both sides, so it's 8R = 32. Now, I'm gonna divide both sides by 8, and that's R = 4.

So, Jerry's got 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: 4"
"So Gary walks around this park, and it's a rectangle. It's 6 miles long and 1.5 miles wide. He walks at 3 miles an hour. I gotta figure out how long it takes him to walk around the whole thing.

To do that, I need to know how far he walks. I know the park is a rectangle, so I gotta add up all the sides. There's two long sides and two short sides. So, I add 6 + 6, that's 12. Then I add 1.5 + 1.5, that's 3. Now I add 12 + 3, that's 15. So he walks 15 miles.

Now, I know he walks 3 miles an hour. To find out how long it takes him, I divide the total miles by his speed. 15 miles / 3 miles an hour = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"So, Sloane counts customers at the dollar store. On the first day, she counts 100 customers. Then, the next day, she counts 50 more than the first day. That's 100 + 50 = 150 customers. Now, by the third day, she counts a total of 500 customers. I wanna know how many customers she counted on the third day.

Let's see... If she counted 100 on the first day and 150 on the second day, that's 250 customers in two days. So, to get to 500 customers by the third day, she must have counted 500 - 250 = 250 customers on the third day.

The final answer is: 250"
"So, there's two pools, and they're leakin' water out at 4 gallons a minute. The big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago. Now, it's got four times as much water as the small pool. I'm gonna try to figure this out.

Let's say the small pool had some water in it 4 minutes ago. I'll call that x gallons. Then the big pool had 2x gallons in it 4 minutes ago, 'cause it's twice as much.

Now, 4 minutes have passed, and 4 gallons a minute is leakin' out of each pool. That's 8 gallons total. So, the small pool lost 4 gallons, and the big pool lost 4 gallons too.

The small pool now has x - 4 gallons. The big pool now has 2x - 4 gallons. We know the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. So, we can set up an equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

I'm not really sure what that means, but I'll try to solve it. I'll subtract 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Add 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons 4 minutes ago. Now it's got 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Lori wants to buy some shoes and a belt. The shoes cost 320 bucks and the belt is 32 bucks. She gets paid 8 bucks an hour for workin'. How many hours she gotta work to get that stuff?

First, you gotta add the cost of the shoes and the belt together. That's 320 + 32, which is 352 bucks. Now, you gotta divide that by how much she gets paid an hour, which is 8 bucks. 

352 divided by 8 is... 44. So she gotta work 44 hours to get that stuff."
"So, Janeth borrows 2000 bucks and she says she's gonna pay it back with some extra. She's gonna pay 165 bucks a month for 12 months. I wanna know how much she'll have left.

First, I gotta figure out how much she'll pay in total. That's 165 bucks a month times 12 months, which is... 165 * 12 = 1980 bucks.

Now, she's gonna pay back the 2000 bucks she borrowed, plus 10% more. That's like, 10% of 2000, which is 200 bucks. So, she's gotta pay back 2000 + 200 = 2200 bucks.

Now, I gotta subtract the 1980 bucks she's gonna pay from the 2200 bucks she owes. That's 2200 - 1980 = 220 bucks.

"So, you wanna know about these three people, right? There's Harriet, Zack, and Adrian. We know Harriet is 21 years old now. 

Now, Zack is twice as old as Harriet, so Zack is 21 * 2 = 42 years old. 

And then there's Adrian, who's three times as old as Harriet. That makes Adrian 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, we gotta think about what they'll be like in three years. So, we add 3 to each of their ages: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

Now, we gotta find the average of their ages. We add 'em up and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"So, let's figure this out. We got four kids, and they scored a total of 251 points. One of 'em, Naomi, scored 68 points. Now, there's this other kid, Yuri, and he scored 10 more points than half of what Naomi got. Half of 68 is 34, so Yuri got 34 + 10, which is 44 points.

Then there's Brianna, and she got 17 more points than Naomi. That's 68 + 17, which is 85 points.

So, Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna got 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. That means Jojo got 251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is: 54"
"So, Carmen does crosswords and sudoku puzzles. She does crosswords in 10 minutes and sudoku in 5 minutes. She did 3 crosswords and 8 sudoku puzzles over the weekend.

For the crosswords, she did 3 of 'em, and each one takes 10 minutes, so that's 3 * 10 = 30 minutes. And for the sudoku, she did 8 of 'em, and each one takes 5 minutes, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 minutes.

Now, let's add 'em together. 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

The final answer is: 70"
"So, Celine starts with 120 liters of water in the tank. She uses 90 liters for her garden. That leaves her with 120 - 90 = 30 liters.

Then, she collects rainwater, and it's twice as much as what's left. That means she gets 2 * 30 = 60 liters of rainwater.

Now, she's got 30 liters left and 60 liters of rainwater. So, she's got 30 + 60 = 90 liters in the tank now.

The final answer is: 90"
"So, Andy plants 90 geraniums. That's a lot. Then, he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. That means he plants 90 - 40 petunias. 

90 - 40 is 50. So, he plants 50 petunias.

Now, I gotta add 'em up. 90 + 50 is... um... 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"So, the company spent 15000 bucks on advertising for a year. Then they spent a third of that on advertising for another year. 

A third of 15000 is 5000. I know this 'cause I counted it out loud: 15000, 5000, 5000, 5000. That's 5000.

So, they spent 15000 the first year and 5000 the second year. That's 15000 + 5000 = 20000.

The final answer is: $20000"
"So, Carlos rents a canoe for 30 bucks an hour and Benji rents a banana boat thingy for 18 bucks an hour. Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours. 

First, we gotta figure out how much Carlos paid. He used the canoe for 3 hours, so that's 30 * 3 = 90 bucks.

Now, we gotta figure out how much Benji paid. He used the raft for 5 hours, so that's 18 * 5 = 90 bucks.

So, in total, they paid 90 + 90 = 180 bucks.

The final answer is: $180"
"So, Andrew's goin' from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, and it takes him 6 days. Then he's comin' back by car, and it takes him half as long as it did by bus. Half of 6 is 3, so it takes him 3 days to get back.

So, if you wanna know how many days it takes him in total, you gotta add the two together. 6 days to get there, and 3 days to get back. That's 6 + 3 = 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"So, James got 30 fire cards, 20 grass cards, and 40 water cards. Then he lost 8 water cards and got 14 more grass cards. I'm gonna count the cards now.

He had 30 fire, 20 grass, and 40 water, that's 90 cards. Then he lost 8 water cards, so he had 32 water cards left. And he had 90 - 8 = 82 cards. Then he got 14 more grass cards, so he had 34 grass cards and 82 total cards.

Now, I'm gonna find out what percent chance it is to pick a water card. I'm gonna take the number of water cards, which is 32, and divide it by the total number of cards, which is 96. Then I'm gonna multiply it by 100.

32 / 96 = 0.333333... * 100 = 33.333... 

So, the answer is 33."
"So Chad gets a burrito for $6.50. Then he gets extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so that's 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. That's a total of $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50 extra.

So the total cost of the meal is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00. Then he gets an upgrade for $3.00, so now it's $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"So, Kalinda and her mom are doin' a puzzle. It's 360 pieces. Kalinda can do 4 pieces a minute, and her mom can do half that, which is 2 pieces a minute. 

So, together they can do 4 + 2 = 6 pieces a minute. 

Now, we gotta figure out how long it takes 'em to do the whole thing. We take the total number of pieces, which is 360, and divide it by how many they can do in a minute, which is 6. 

360 / 6 = 60 minutes. 

Now, we gotta turn that into hours. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 60 by 60. 

60 / 60 = 1 hour.

So, it's gonna take 'em 1 hour to finish the puzzle.

The final answer is: 1"
"So, there's a watermelon farm with 120 watermelons. After two months, 30% of 'em are ready to be picked. That's 30% of 120, which is 36 watermelons. So, they got 36 watermelons ready to be picked.

Now, they got 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left. Then, after two weeks, 3/4 of those 84 watermelons are ready to be picked. That's 3/4 of 84, which is 63 watermelons.

So, they got 63 watermelons ready to be picked, and they had 84 watermelons left. That means they got 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons left that ain't ready to be picked.

The final answer is: 21"
"So Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs 20,000 bucks. He gotta pay tax on 'em, which is 10% of the total cost. That's like, a tenth of the total cost. Then he gotta pay a thousand bucks for each car to register 'em.

First, you gotta find the total cost of the cars. That's 12 cars times 20,000 bucks per car, which is 240,000 bucks.

Now, you gotta find the tax. That's 10% of 240,000, which is like, a tenth of that. That's 24,000 bucks.

Then you gotta find the registration fee. That's 12 cars times a thousand bucks per car, which is 12,000 bucks.

Now, you add all that up. 240,000 (cars) + 24,000 (tax) + 12,000 (registration) = 276,000 bucks.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"So, Kylie and Robert go to the beach and collect shells. Robert gets 20 shells on Monday. Kylie gets 5 more than Robert, so she gets 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

Then, on Tuesday, Kylie gets 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. That's like, 25 * 2. 

25 * 2 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"So, Dax went to the farm and found some bugs and ants. There's 50 ants. Now, it says there's half as many bugs as ants. That means if there's 50 ants, there's 50 / 2 bugs. That's 25 bugs.

So, if there's 25 bugs and 50 ants, how many insects is that? You just add 'em together. 25 + 50 = 75.

The final answer is: 75"
"So, there's 36 penguins sunbathin' in the snow. Now, some of 'em jump in the ocean and some go inside the cave. 

One-third of 'em go in the ocean, that's 12 penguins. And another one-third go inside the cave, that's 12 penguins too. 

So, in total, 12 + 12 is 24 penguins that left the sunbathin' area. Now, we gotta subtract that from the total number of penguins. 

36 - 24 is... 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"So Steve wants to grow some tomatoes, right? He eats a lot of 'em, like 6 a day. His girlfriend eats half that, so she eats 3 a day. They both eat 'em up, and we gotta figure out how many vines they need.

First, we gotta find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week. Steve eats 6 a day, so that's 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes a week. His girlfriend eats 3 a day, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 tomatoes a week. Together, they eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes a week.

Now, each vine gives 'em 3 tomatoes a week. So, we gotta divide the total tomatoes they eat by the tomatoes per vine. That's 63 / 3 = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to grow all the tomatoes he and his girlfriend eat.

The final answer is: 21"
"So, John's got 20 friends comin' over, and he wants to give each one 4 slices of pizza. But pizzas come in 8 slices, right? So, we gotta figure out how many pizzas he needs.

First, we gotta find out how many slices in total he needs. That's 20 friends times 4 slices each, so that's 20 x 4 = 80 slices.

Now, we gotta divide that by the number of slices per pizza, which is 8. So, 80 slices divided by 8 slices per pizza is... 10 pizzas.

The final answer is: 10"
"So, Ram buys 25 pens, right? And he can make a new pen from the ink of 5 old pens. That means he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens from the first 25 pens. 

Now, he's got 5 empty pens left. He can use the ink from these 5 pens to make 1 more pen. 

So, he's got 25 pens to start, then 5 more pens from the first 25, and 1 more pen from the last 5. That's 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 pens.

The final answer is: 31"
"So, Johnny had 20 bucks at first. Then he got 10 more, so he had 30 bucks. Now, that 30 bucks, it just kinda... multiplied by 3, ya know? Like, it got three times bigger. So, I gotta multiply 30 by 3.

30 * 3 = 90

"So, Jessa is 20 years old. That's what we know. Now, we gotta figure out how old the other two are.

Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Now, Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

So, if Jessa is 20, Joan is 25, and Mary is 23, we gotta add 'em all up. 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"So, there's 1000 students in the school hall. Now, 30% of 'em went out through exit A. That's 30% of 1000, which is 300 students. So, we got 1000 - 300 = 700 students left.

Now, 3/5 of the 700 students went out through exit B. That's 3/5 of 700, which is 420 students. So, we got 700 - 420 = 280 students left.

These 280 students went out through exit C.

The final answer is: 280"
"So, John got 54 candies. He got twice as many as Robert. That means Robert got 54 / 2 = 27 candies. Now, James got 6 more than Robert, so James got 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

The final answer is: 21"
"So, Dolly got 2 books and Pandora got 1 book. They both read their own books, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 books right there. Then, Dolly reads Pandora's book, and Pandora reads Dolly's 2 books. So, Dolly reads 3 books total (her 2 and Pandora's 1), and Pandora reads 3 books total (her 1 and Dolly's 2). That's 3 + 3 = 6 books in total.

The final answer is: 6"
"So, Mike's got 5 pen pals, but he stopped bein' friends with 2 of 'em. That leaves him with 3. Each of 'em sends him 2 letters a week, and each letter's 5 pages long. That's 2 * 3 = 6 letters, and 6 * 5 = 30 pages. He writes back to 'em, so that's another 30 pages. That's a total of 30 + 30 = 60 pages.

Now, he can write a page every 6 minutes. So, to find out how long it takes him to write all them pages, we multiply 60 by 6. That's 360 minutes. To turn that into hours, we divide by 60. 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"So Jason's got a phone plan that's 1000 minutes. He talks to his boss every day for 15 minutes, and that's 30 days, so that's 15 * 30 = 450 minutes. Then he's got 300 extra minutes he used for other stuff. So, that's 450 + 300 = 750 minutes he used. Now, we gotta take away the minutes he used from the total minutes he got. That's 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes. 

The final answer is: 250"
"So, let's figure this out. Griffin had 24 fries. Then Kyle took 5 of 'em. That leaves Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Then Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So now Griffin's got 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Now, let's say Ginger gave Griffin some fries. We'll call that number 'x'. So after Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Then Colby took 3 less than Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So we gotta figure out what 'x' is. We can do that by solving the equation 7 + x = 27.

To do that, we gotta get 'x' by itself. We can do that by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation. That gives us x = 27 - 7 = 20.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, there's two aquariums with snails and fish. One's got 4 snails and the other's got 32 snails. The difference between 'em is 28 snails. Now, I'm told this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Since they got the same number of fish, let's call it x. That means there's 2x fish in total.

So, 28 is twice 2x. That means 28 is equal to 4x. Now, I gotta figure out what x is. I'll divide 28 by 4 to find out.

28 divided by 4 is 7. So, there's 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"So, the makeup artist charges 250 bucks an hour. She does 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, for 5 weeks. That's a lotta work. 

First, you gotta figure out how much she makes in a day. That's 250 * 6, which is 1500 bucks a day. Then you gotta multiply that by 4, 'cause she does it 4 days a week. That's 6000 bucks a week. Now, you gotta multiply that by 5, 'cause the movie takes 5 weeks. That's 30,000 bucks.

But then, she gives Jean a 10% discount. That's like, a tenth of 30,000. So, that's 3000 bucks off. Now, you gotta subtract that from 30,000. That's 27,000 bucks.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"So, Isabelle spent money on cake, presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags. She spent $12 on cake, $43 on presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags. 

First, we gotta add all that up. $12 + $43 is $55. Then we add $15 to that, so it's $70. Then we add $4, so it's $74. And finally, we add $22, so it's $96.

Now, Isabelle split the cost with her two parents. That's 3 people in total. To find out how much each person paid, we gotta divide $96 by 3.

$96 / 3 = $32

So, each person paid $32."
"So the chef bought 4 bags of onions. Each bag is 50 pounds. I think that's a lot of onions. 

I know that each pound costs $1.50. So if we got 4 bags, that's 50 pounds per bag, so that's 200 pounds. And if each pound is $1.50, then we multiply 200 pounds by $1.50.

200 * 1.50 = 300

"So, let's figure this out. Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday. Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

Then, on Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's add up all the cookies Sue ate: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies. And her sister ate 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Each cookie has 200 calories. So, Sue ate 46 * 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister ate 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue ate than her sister: 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. That's 27 girls so far. So, there's 3 girls left in the third class.

If there's 30 girls total and 27 in the first two classes, that means there's 3 girls in the third class. And if there's 30 boys total and 3 girls in the third class, that means there's 27 boys in the third class.

So, the answer is 27."

"So, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the night before. 

Let's figure this out. If he killed three fewer cougars than last night, that means he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

Last night, he killed 10 wolves, so today he killed 36 wolves. That's 10 + 36 = 46 wolves.

And last night, he killed 15 cougars, and today he killed 12 cougars. That's 15 + 12 = 27 cougars.

So, Rick killed 46 wolves and 27 cougars. That's 46 + 27 = 73 animals in total.

30% of 30 is like, um, 30 * 0.3, that's 9. So, Anne went down 30 - 9, that's 21 times.

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. That means he went down 21 * 4, that's 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"So, there's 10 stalls with 20 cows each. Then Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and puts 'em in the stalls. He puts an equal number in each stall. 

First, we gotta figure out how many cows he puts in each stall. He got 40 cows and 10 stalls, so we divide 40 by 10. That's 4 cows per stall. 

Now, each stall got 20 cows already and he adds 4 more. So, each stall got 20 + 4 = 24 cows.

Now, we wanna know how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8. That's 24 * 8 = 192.

The final answer is: 192"

"So, you wanna know how much a big ol' redwood tree weighs. It's 200 feet tall, and it's made up of 10-foot sections. Each section weighs 400 pounds. 

First, we gotta figure out how many sections there are. We do that by divin' 200 by 10. That's 200 ÷ 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

But, them termites came and ate some of the wood. They ate 30% of it. That's like, a third. So, we gotta take a third of 8000 away. That's 8000 - (8000 * 0.3) = 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

So, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds."

Now, Jamal's got more bananas than apples. He's got 4 more bananas than apples. So, he's got 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea's got half as many bananas as Jamal. That means she's got 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's count all the fruits. We got Andrea's apples, Jamal's apples, Andrea's bananas, and Jamal's bananas. That's 52 + 44 + 24 + 48 = 168.

First, we gotta add 'em up. 36 + 30 is... um... 66. That's how many cookies she's makin' in total.

Now, we gotta figure out how much flour we need for 66 cookies. See, it takes 2 cups of flour to make a dozen cookies. A dozen's 12 cookies. So, we gotta divide 66 by 12.

66 divided by 12 is... um... 5 and a half. That's like 5 and a half dozen cookies. Now, we gotta figure out how much flour we need for 6 cookies. That's half a dozen, so we need half a cup of flour for that.

But we still got 5 dozen cookies left. That's 5 * 2 cups of flour. That's 10 cups of flour.

So, we add 'em up. We got 10 cups for the 5 dozen cookies and 1 cup for the 6 cookies. That's... 11 cups of flour.

"So, you got a cup with 9,300 pennies in it. You wanna know how much money that is if you take two thirds of 'em. 

First, you gotta figure out what two thirds of 9,300 is. I think I know how to do that. You gotta multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

9,300 * 2 = 18,600
18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Now, I know each penny is worth a penny, which is a dollar cent, or 0.01 dollars. So, if you got 6,200 pennies, you multiply that by 0.01.

6,200 * 0.01 = 62

But then there's this other thing, a brokerage fee, which is like a fee for the person sellin' the house. It's 5% of the price, which is like, a fifth of the price. So, 5% of $350,000 is $17,500.

Then there's this other fee, the transfer fee. That's 12% of the price, which is like, a twelfth of the price. So, 12% of $350,000 is $42,000.

Now, we gotta add all these costs together. So, $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 is $409,500. That's how much the house is gonna cost her.

Now, we gotta find out how much more it's gonna cost her than her budget. So, we subtract her budget from the total cost. $409,500 - $400,000 is $4,500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"So, Mr. Tan sold his house for 400,000 dollars. He had to pay some fees, right? There's a transfer fee, which is 3% of the selling price. That's like, a third of a percent, so it's 12,000 dollars. Then there's a brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price. That's like, a fifth of a percent, so it's 20,000 dollars. 

So, he paid 12,000 + 20,000 dollars in fees, which is 32,000 dollars. Now, we gotta subtract that from the selling price. 400,000 - 32,000 is 368,000 dollars. But wait, he still owes 250,000 dollars on the house. So, we gotta subtract that too. 368,000 - 250,000 is 118,000 dollars.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"So, you wanna know how long it takes to cook chicken? Alright, let me break it down. It takes 20 minutes to get the oil hot, right? Then it takes longer to get it to 400 degrees. It's like, 40% more time, which is like, a quarter more, you know? So, that's 20 minutes plus 8 minutes, which is 28 minutes to get it to 400 degrees.

Now, after that, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to get the oil hot. So, that's 20 - 5, which is 15 minutes to cook the chicken.

So, in total, it's 20 minutes to get the oil hot, 28 minutes to get it to 400 degrees, and 15 minutes to cook the chicken. That's 20 + 28 + 15, which is... 63 minutes.

The final answer is: 63"
"So, the real estate agent spent money on ads. He spent $5 on each newspaper ad and $75 on each TV ad. He bought 50 newspaper ads and 15 TV ads.

To find out how much he spent on newspaper ads, I gotta multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads. That's $5 * 50 = $250.

Now, I gotta do the same for the TV ads. He spent $75 on each one, and he bought 15. So, that's $75 * 15 = $1125.

Now, I gotta add those two numbers together to find out how much he spent in total. $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"So, the juggler can juggle 16 balls. Now, half of them are golf balls. That means there's 8 golf balls. And half of them are blue. So, that's 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

The final answer is: 4"
"So Mary got some M&Ms. She got 3 bags. The first one had 300 M&Ms. The second one had 12 more than the first one, so it had 312 M&Ms. The third one, well, it had a hole in it, so it only had half of the first one, which is 150 M&Ms.

Let me add 'em up for ya: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The final answer is: 762"
"So, John got 2 houses, and each house got 3 bedrooms. Now, each bedroom got 2 windows. That's 2 houses * 3 bedrooms * 2 windows = 12 windows in the bedrooms.

Now, there's some more windows in each house that ain't in the bedrooms. There's 4 of 'em in each house. That's 2 houses * 4 windows = 8 more windows.

So, if we add the windows in the bedrooms and the extra windows, we get 12 + 8 = 20 windows."
"So the mom buys some stuff. She gets cocoa for 4 dollars and 20 cents, laundry for 9 dollars and 45 cents, and some pasta for 1 dollar and 35 cents. She pays 20 dollars. I gotta find out how much change she gets back.

First, I add up the cost of all the stuff. 4 dollars and 20 cents plus 9 dollars and 45 cents is 13 dollars and 65 cents. Then I add the 1 dollar and 35 cents for the pasta, that's 15 dollars and 00 cents. Now I got 15 dollars and 00 cents. 

Now I gotta find out how much change she gets back. I take the 20 dollars she paid and subtract the 15 dollars and 00 cents. That's 20 dollars minus 15 dollars and 00 cents. That's 5 dollars and 00 cents."
"So, Terri's makin' a sweater with two sleeves, a collar, and a fancy rosette thingy. The body of the sweater needs 900 stitches. The collar needs a tenth of that, which is 90 stitches. The rosette needs twice as many stitches as the collar, so that's 180 stitches.

Now, we gotta figure out how many stitches the sleeves need. We know the whole sweater needs 1800 stitches. The body's 900, the collar's 90, and the rosette's 180. That's 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches. So, the sleeves need 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there's two sleeves, we gotta divide 630 by 2. That's 315 stitches per sleeve.

So, the answer is 315."
"So, Mrs. Rylan got 20 packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds. Tomato seeds cost 40 bucks a packet, and celery seeds cost 30 bucks a packet. 

First, I gotta figure out how much the tomato seeds cost. That's 20 packets times 40 bucks, so that's 800 bucks. Then I gotta figure out how much the celery seeds cost. That's 80 packets times 30 bucks, so that's 2400 bucks.

Now, I gotta add those two numbers together. 800 plus 2400 is 3200. So, Mrs. Rylan spent 3200 bucks on seeds.

The final answer is: $3200"
"So, Sean's got a big role in a play. He's gotta memorize lines for two scenes and a song. The song's got 54 lines. That's a lot of lines.

The first scene's got twice as many lines as the song, so that's 108 lines. But only a third of those lines are his, so he's gotta memorize 36 lines from that scene.

The second scene's got 6 more lines than the song, so that's 60 lines. And four-fifths of those lines are his, so he's gotta memorize 48 lines from that scene.

Now, let's add up all the lines he's gotta memorize: 54 (from the song) + 36 (from the first scene) + 48 (from the second scene) = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"So, Carly's got 80 cards. Now, 2/5 of 'em got the letter A on 'em. That's 2/5 * 80, which is 32 cards. 

Now, we gotta find out how many cards got the letter B. We got 80 - 32 = 48 cards left. Half of 'em got the letter B, so that's 48 / 2 = 24 cards.

Now, we got 48 - 24 = 24 cards left. 5/8 of 'em got the letter C, so that's 5/8 * 24 = 15 cards.

Now, we gotta find out how many cards got the letter D. We got 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9 cards left. So, 9 cards got the letter D.

The final answer is: 9"
"So, Matthew digs small holes for shrubs in 3 minutes and big holes for trees in 10 minutes. He gotta dig 30 small holes and 15 big holes. 

First, let's figure out how long it takes him to dig the small holes. 3 minutes per hole, and he's diggin' 30 holes, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 minutes. 

Now, let's do the big holes. 10 minutes per hole, and he's diggin' 15 holes, so that's 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.

Now we gotta add 'em together. 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes. 

To turn that into hours, we gotta divide by 60. 240 / 60 = 4. 

So, it takes Matthew 4 hours to dig all them holes."
"So, Mico and Marco, they wanna know each other's ages, right? And they said their ages add up to 20. Now, we gotta figure out how old they'll be in 10 years.

Let's say Mico's age is M and Marco's age is m. We know M + m = 20. Now, in 10 years, Mico will be M + 10 and Marco will be m + 10. So, we add those two together, M + 10 + m + 10. That's the same as 20 + 10 + 20 + 10.

20 + 10 is 30, and 20 + 10 is 30 too. So, 30 + 30 is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's figure this out. We got two things here. Ruby is older than Sam, and it's a lot. It's 6 times older. So if we say Sam is S, then Ruby is 6S.

Now, in 9 years, Ruby's gonna be 3 times as old as Sam. That means in 9 years, Ruby's age plus 9 is gonna be 3 times Sam's age plus 9. We gotta make it equal, so we can solve it.

Let's write it down: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, we gotta get rid of the S in the second part. We do that by adding 9 to both sides, so it's like this: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Now, we gotta get rid of the 9 on the left side. We do that by subtracting 9 from both sides: 3S = 27 - 9

Now we do the math: 3S = 18

Now we gotta get S by itself. We do that by dividing both sides by 3: S = 18 / 3

Now we do the math: S = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"So Peter bought 20 popsicles. Each one costs 25 cents. That's 20 * 25 cents. That's 500 cents. Now, I gotta convert that to dollars. There's 100 cents in a dollar, so 500 cents is 5 dollars.

Then he bought 4 ice cream bars. Each one costs 50 cents. That's 4 * 50 cents. That's 200 cents. Now, I gotta convert that to dollars. There's 100 cents in a dollar, so 200 cents is 2 dollars.

Now, I gotta add those two numbers together. 5 dollars + 2 dollars is 7 dollars.

The final answer is: $7"
"So, there's a bunch of snakes in a park. There's 40 cobras and 60 mambas. Now, the cobras got 70 spots each, and the mambas got half that, so they got 35 spots each.

First, I gotta find out how many spots all the cobras got. I do that by multiplying 40 by 70, which is 2800 spots.

Now, I gotta find out how many spots all the mambas got. I do that by multiplying 60 by 35, which is 2100 spots.

Now, I gotta add all the spots together. So, I add 2800 and 2100, which is 4900 spots.

Lastly, I gotta find out half of that. I do that by dividing 4900 by 2, which is 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"Maddy's buyin' pizza for her cousin's soccer game. There's 12 kids on the team and 3 coaches. Each kid brings 2 friends. So, that's 12 kids + 3 coaches = 15 people. And then there's 12 kids * 2 friends = 24 friends. That's a lotta people. So, 15 people + 24 friends = 39 people in total.

Now, each pizza feeds 3 people. So, we gotta divide 39 people by 3. That's 13 pizzas. 

Each pizza costs 15 bucks. So, 13 pizzas * 15 bucks = 195 bucks. That's how much Maddy's gonna spend.

The final answer is: $195"
"So, Katerina makes them fancy necklaces with topaz stones. She uses 8 of 'em, and then she fills in the spaces with silver beads. Each stone is an inch long, and each bead is a quarter of an inch long. The necklace is 25 inches long. 

First, I gotta figure out how much space the stones take up. There's 8 stones, so that's 8 inches. Now, I gotta find out how much space is left for the beads. That's 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Now, I gotta figure out how many beads fit in that space. Each bead is a quarter of an inch, so I gotta divide 17 by a quarter. That's like 17 divided by 0.25. That's 68. 

So, Katerina uses 68 silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 68"
"So, Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. Her brother Braylen wrote 40 stories. And her sister Margot, she wrote 60 stories. That's a lot of stories.

Now, let's see how many they wrote in the second week. Alani doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories. Braylen doubled his stories too, so he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories. And Margot, she doubled her stories as well, so she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up all the stories they wrote in the second week. That's 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.

Now, let's add up all the stories they wrote in the first and second week. That's 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories in the first week, and 240 stories in the second week. So, 120 + 240 = 360 stories.

The final answer is: 360"
"So, Ann is 9 years old, right? And her brother is twice as old as her. That means he's 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

So, in 3 years, he'll be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

The final answer is: 21"
"So Kelly's got 5 quarters and 2 dimes. I think I know what that means. A quarter is like, 25 cents, right? So 5 quarters is 5 x 25, that's 125 cents. And a dime is like, 10 cents, so 2 dimes is 2 x 10, that's 20 cents.

So if I add 'em together, I get 125 + 20, that's 145 cents. That's how much money Kelly's got.

Now, she buys a can of pop for 55 cents. I don't know what that is, but I guess it's like, a drink or something. So if she spends 55 cents, I gotta subtract that from 145. That's 145 - 55, that's 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"So, there's a flag with 76 stars on it. It's got three rows of 8 stars, and two rows of 6 stars. I gotta figure out how many rows of 5 stars it's got.

First, I count the stars in the 8-star rows. That's 3 rows times 8 stars, which is 24 stars. Then I count the stars in the 6-star rows. That's 2 rows times 6 stars, which is 12 stars.

Now, I add those two numbers together. 24 plus 12 is 36. So, that's how many stars are in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

Now, I gotta find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows. I know there's 76 stars total, and 36 of them are in the 8-star and 6-star rows. So, that means there's 76 minus 36, which is 40 stars left.

Now, I know each row has 5 stars, so I divide 40 by 5. That's 8. 

The final answer is: 8"
"So, you wanna know how many trucks they need to carry them flagstones. Alright, let's figure it out. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and they got 80 of 'em. That's a lotta weight. 

First, we gotta find out how much all them flagstones weigh together. You do that by multiplyin' the weight of one flagstone by how many there is. So, 75 pounds * 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds. That's a lot of weight.

Now, we gotta know how much weight each truck can carry. They said it's 2000 pounds. So, we gotta divide the total weight by how much each truck can carry. That's 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds. That's like, 3. You gotta have 3 trucks to carry all them flagstones.

The final answer is: 3"
"So, there's two cars. One's goin' fast, one's goin' slow. The fast one's goin' 60 miles an hour. The slow one's goin' half that, so it's goin' 30 miles an hour. They both go the same distance, 480 miles.

To figure out how long it took the fast one, I think you gotta divide the distance by the speed. So, 480 miles divided by 60 miles an hour is... um... 8 hours. That's how long the fast one took.

Now, the slow one's goin' 30 miles an hour. So, to find out how long it took, I gotta divide 480 miles by 30 miles an hour. That's... 16 hours.

So, the slow one took 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's figure this out. Ali's got 22 medals, and his friend Izzy's got 5 less than him, so Izzy's got 17 medals. Together, they got 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

Now, they got 10 times less medals than what's been given out. That means the total number of medals given out is 10 times 39. 

To find that out, I'll just multiply 39 by 10. That's 390."
"So, we got 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet's got 5 chocolate bars. That's 8 * 5 = 40 chocolate bars in total.

Now, we got 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. That's 4 * 6 = 24 chocolate bars for the adults.

So, we got 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars left for the kids. There's 8 kids, so we gotta divide the chocolate bars among them. 16 / 8 = 2.

"So, Susan gets paid $5 every 10 minutes for doin' this online thing. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., but she takes a break for half an hour. That's like, 3 hours, right? But she don't work for the whole 3 hours 'cause she takes a break. So, we gotta subtract that half hour from 3 hours.

3 hours minus 0.5 hours is 2.5 hours. Now, we gotta figure out how many minutes that is. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so...

2.5 hours * 60 minutes = 150 minutes

Now, we gotta find out how many 10-minute chunks there are in 150 minutes. That's like, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and so on. Let's see...

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15

So, there's 15 chunks of 10 minutes. And she gets paid $5 for each chunk. That's like, $5, $10, $15, and so on. Let's see...

15 chunks * $5/chunk = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"So, there's three guys, Mike, Jim, and Tony. They play a game and after three rounds, Mike's got 21 points. Jim's got 3 less than Mike, so Jim's got 18 points. Tony's got twice as many points as Mike, so Tony's got 42 points.

Now, in the fourth round, if you got more than 20 points, you get an extra point. Mike's got 21, so he gets an extra point and now he's got 22 points. Jim's got 18, so he don't get an extra point. Tony's got 42, so he gets an extra point and now he's got 43 points.

Now, let's add up all their points: Mike's got 22, Jim's got 18, and Tony's got 43. So, 22 + 18 + 43 is... 83."
"So, Will buys 15 oranges. Then he tells his two sons to wash some oranges. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half that, so he's 4 years old. 

The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. That's a total of 8 + 4 = 12 oranges washed.

Now, we gotta find out how many oranges are left unwashed. We know Will had 15 oranges, and 12 of 'em got washed. So, we subtract 12 from 15. That's 15 - 12 = 3 oranges left unwashed.

"Darren does exercises for two days. On the first day, he does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than the first day, 10 fewer squats, and he doubles the number of dumbbell presses.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Total for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

"So, we gotta figure out how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last. Now, each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat 2 meals a day. That's 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg per person per day. 

If there's 5 people eatin' rice every day, that's 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg of rice per day. Now, we gotta find out how many days 42 kg will last. We do that by divin' 42 by 2.

42 / 2 = 21 days

Now, we gotta find out how many weeks that is. There's 7 days in a week, so we do 21 / 7.

21 / 7 = 3

So, the rice will last 3 weeks.

"So, Sam sells bread, right? He wants to sell 120 crates in a week. But he was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell nothin' on them days. Then he sold 20 crates on the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

Let's add up how many crates he sold: 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65. That's how many crates he sold.

Now, we gotta find out how many crates he was off from his target. His target was 120 crates. So, we gotta subtract 65 from 120. That's 120 - 65 = 55.

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target.

"So, Carmen goes to an auction and she wants to buy this old desk. She starts with a bid of $200, and then she keeps bidding. There's three other people bidding too, and they each bid once. Carmen bids after each of them, and she keeps going till she wins.

So, there's 3 other people, and they each bid once. That means Carmen bids 3 times after them. So, in total, there's 3 + 3 = 6 bids.

Now, the first bid is $200, and each time someone bids, it goes up by $50. We gotta find out how much money it costs her in total. To do that, we gotta add up all the bids. It's like counting up by 50s.

The first bid is $200, then $250, then $300, then $350, then $400, and finally $450. We add those up: 200 + 250 = 450, 450 + 300 = 750, 750 + 350 = 1100, 1100 + 400 = 1500, and 1500 + 450 = 1950.

So, the desk costs her $1950."
"So, John gets a ride to work every day. He goes 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so that's 60 miles a day. He does this 5 days a week, and he does it for 50 weeks a year. That's a lot of miles.

He gets charged 2 bucks a mile, so that's 60 miles * 2 dollars = 120 dollars a day. He does this 5 days a week, so that's 120 * 5 = 600 dollars a week. And he does this for 50 weeks a year, so that's 600 * 50 = 30000 dollars a year.

But he also gives his driver a 150 dollar bonus every month. That's 150 * 12 = 1800 dollars a year.

So, how much does he pay a year for driving?

"So, you wanna know how many pieces of paper you need for a 32-page tabloid. Alright, let me think about it. 

You gotta fold the paper in half, right? And then you gotta put the pages on it. Now, if you fold it in half, you get two sides. And you gotta put 16 pages on each side. 

So, you need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages, and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages. That's because when you fold it, the front and back become the left and right sides. 

So, you need 2 + 2 = 4 pieces of paper. That's it."
"So, Annika had $50. She spent half of it on food and stuff, which is $25. Then she spent another $10 on rides. That's a total of $25 + $10 = $35. Now, we gotta take away the $35 from the $50. That leaves us with $50 - $35 = $15.

"So Elise is sellin' her dad's books. She's got 250 books in total. She's sold some, but she's got 50 left unsold. This year, she sold 45 books. That means she sold 90 books last year, 'cause she sold twice as many this year. 

Now, let's figure out how many books she sold the year before that. We know she's got 50 unsold, and she's sold 45 this year and 90 last year. So, she must've sold 250 - 50 - 45 - 90 = 65 books the year before last.

Each book is 20 bucks, so she made 65 * 20 = 1300 dollars that year."
"Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. He gets paid 10 bucks an hour. He also gets a 300 dollar bonus every week if the company does good. 

First, I gotta figure out how many hours he works in a week. He works 10 hours a day, and that's 5 days a week, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 hours a week.

Now, I gotta figure out how much he makes in a week. He makes 10 bucks an hour, and he works 50 hours a week, so that's 10 * 50 = 500 bucks a week.

But he also gets a 300 dollar bonus every week, so that's 500 + 300 = 800 bucks a week.

April has 4 weeks, so I gotta multiply 800 by 4 to get the total. 800 * 4 = 3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"So John arm wrestles 20 people, and he wins 80% of 'em. That means he loses 20% of 'em. To find out how many people he lost to, I gotta figure out 20% of 20.

20% of 20 is like, 4 people. Yeah, that's right. He lost to 4 people.

The final answer is: 4"
"So, the bakery makes 60 loaves a day. They sell 2/3 of 'em in the mornin'. That's 2/3 of 60, which is 40 loaves. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many are left. We had 60, and we sold 40, so that's 60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Now, they sell half of the rest in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is 10. 

So, they sell 10 loaves in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"I don't rightly know how to do them fancy math problems, but I'll give it a shot. 

So, Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. That's like, 2 pounds a week, right? 

Now, Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight, but it takes her 4 weeks to lose what Joey loses in a week. That means Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

If Joey loses 2 pounds a week, and Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, that means Sandy loses 1/2 pound a week. 

So, if Sandy loses 1/2 pound a week, it'll take her 8 weeks to lose 8 pounds. 

So, the answer is 8 weeks.

8"
"So, you wanna know how much I'll save if I buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk. Alright, let's see...

The ice cream costs $13, but it's on sale for $11. So, if I buy 2 of 'em, I'll save 2 x ($13 - $11) = 2 x $2 = $4.

Now, the milk costs $1, but it's on sale for $0.5. If I buy 4 of 'em, I'll save 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2.

So, if I add 'em up, I'll save $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"So, Helena's got this serum that makes people grow extra limbs. It makes 'em grow an arm every three days and a leg every five days. I wanna know how many extra limbs they'll have after fifteen days.

Let's see, if they grow an arm every three days, in fifteen days they'll grow 5 arms. That's 'cause 15 divided by 3 is 5.

Now, if they grow a leg every five days, in fifteen days they'll grow 3 legs. That's 'cause 15 divided by 5 is 3.

So, if they got 5 arms and 3 legs, that's a total of 8 extra limbs.

The final answer is: 8"
"So, let's figure this out. Theo's got $6000 for his trip. He buys 6 suits for $100 each, that's 6 x 100 = $600. Then he buys 3 suitcases for $50 each, that's 3 x 50 = $150. Now, the flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit. 5 times the cost of a suit is 5 x 100 = $500, and $700 more than that is $500 + $700 = $1200. So, the total he's spent so far is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Now, he's got $6000 - $1950 = $4050 left. He wants to save $2000, so he's got $4050 - $2000 = $2050 left over. That's how much he can spend on gifts.

The final answer is: $50"
"So, there's a family of 5 people. Three of 'em eats 3 eggs each day, and the other two eats 2 eggs each day. I wanna know how many eggs they eats in a week.

First, I think about the three people who eats 3 eggs each day. That's 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. Then I think about the other two people who eats 2 eggs each day. That's 2 * 2 = 4 eggs. So, in a day, they eats 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Now, I gotta think about how many days in a week. I know that's 7. So, if they eats 13 eggs a day, they'll eats 13 * 7 eggs in a week. That's 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"So, you wanna know how old Trent is? Alright, let me think. There's this Quinn guy, and he's 30 years old. Now, there's this Jane, and she's younger than Quinn. She's 3 years younger, that's how much. So, Jane is 30 - 3, that's 27.

Now, Trent, he's older than Jane. He's 5 years older, to be exact. So, if Jane is 27, Trent is 27 + 5, that's 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"So, let's figure this out. Cera is 46 years old now. Six years ago, she was 40 years old. That means Noah was half her age back then, so he was 20 years old.

Now, I'm told the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age. That's 3000 * 20 = 60000. But I'm also told that population was half of what it is now. So, if it was half, that means the current population is double that, which is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"So, there's a football team with 105 members. They got offense, defense, and special teams. I'm tryin' to figure out how many players are on the defense.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is D. Then, the offense got twice as many players, so that's 2D. And the special teams got half the number of players as the defense, so that's D/2.

Now, we add 'em all up: 2D + D + D/2. That's the total number of players, which is 105.

So, we got 2D + D + D/2 = 105. I'm gonna multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 4D + 2D + D = 210.

Now, I'm gonna combine like terms: 7D = 210.

Now, I'm gonna divide both sides by 7: D = 30.

So, there's 30 players on the defense.

The final answer is: 30"
"So Martha's havin' a party, right? She invited 2 families with 6 people in each family, and 3 families with 4 people in each family. That's a lotta people. 

First, let's figure out how many people are comin' from the big families. That's 2 * 6 = 12 people. And from the little families, that's 3 * 4 = 12 people. So, in total, that's 12 + 12 = 24 people.

But then, some people got sick and can't come. That's 8 people. So now we gotta subtract 'em. 24 - 8 = 16 people.

Now, some people had other plans, and they can't come neither. That's 1/4 of 8, which is 2 people. So we gotta subtract 'em too. 16 - 2 = 14 people.

The final answer is: 14"
"So, Solomon got 20 marbles from his friend Johanna. Then he added them to the store that already had 50 marbles. That makes 20 + 50 = 70 marbles.

Now, Solomon's dad gave him some more marbles. He gave him 2/5 of the marbles Solomon got from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is 8. So, Solomon's dad gave him 8 marbles.

Now we gotta add those 8 marbles to the 70 marbles Solomon already had. That makes 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight, we gotta multiply the number of marbles by the weight of each marble. That's 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"So you wanna know how much it costs to fill a pool, right? Alright, let's figure it out. The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. We gotta find out how much water it holds. 

To do that, we multiply the length, width, and height together. That's like, 6 x 4 x 5. That's 120. So the pool holds 120 cubic feet of water.

Now, it costs 10 cents per cubic foot to fill it up. We gotta multiply 120 by 10 cents. That's like, 120 x 0.1. That's 12 dollars.

So, it costs 12 dollars to fill the pool.

The final answer is: $12"
"So, there's a classroom with 30 boys. They got 3 times as many girls as boys, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 girls. Then, they got nongendered kids, and they got 1/10 as many nongendered kids as boys, so that's 1/10 * 30 = 3 nongendered kids.

Now, we gotta add 'em all up. We got 30 boys, 90 girls, and 3 nongendered kids. That's 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 kids in total.

The final answer is: 123"
"So, you wanna know how many poles we need for 45 wires. I think I know this. See, there's a ratio, like a secret code. It's 1 pole to 3 wires. That's how it works. 

So, if we got 45 wires, we gotta find out how many groups of 3 we got. That's easy, just divide 45 by 3. That's 15. Now, if we got 15 groups of 3, that means we need 15 poles.

So, the answer is 15 poles.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, there's a party with 25 men and 15 women. Then, a bunch of people leave. They leave 1/4 of the total number of people. I don't know what that means, but I'll try to figure it out.

First, I gotta find out how many people left. If 1/4 of the people left, that means 1/4 of 40 (that's the total number of people) left. 1/4 of 40 is 10. So, 10 people left.

Now, I know there's 22 men left. That means 3 men left, 'cause 25 - 22 is 3. And if 3 men left, that means 7 women left, 'cause 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men.

Now, I know there were 15 women at the start, and 7 of them left. So, that means 8 women are left.

The final answer is: 8"
"So, the magazine costs half as much as the book. And the book costs $4. That means the magazine costs $4 / 2, which is $2.

Now, the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, if the magazine is $2, the pen is $2 - $1, which is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"So, Jam got 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose ones, and that's a total of 26 pencils. I'm thinkin', if she got 3 boxes, and each box got the same number of pencils, I can figure out how many pencils in each box. Let's see... 26 pencils in total, and 2 of 'em are loose, so that leaves 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the boxes. Now, if I divide 24 by 3, I get 8. So, each box got 8 pencils.

Now, Jam's sister, Meg, got 46 pencils. If we add those to Jam's 26, we get 72 pencils in total. Now, I need to figure out how many boxes we need to put all those pencils in. If each box got 8 pencils, I can divide 72 by 8 to find out how many boxes we need. That's 72 ÷ 8 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"So, Shannon makes iced coffee by puttin' ice cubes in it. Each ice cube makes the coffee 13 degrees cooler and 12 milliliters weaker. She wants it to be 65 degrees cooler, so we gotta figure out how many ice cubes she needs. 

Let's say the coffee starts at 100 degrees. We wanna get it down to 35 degrees. That's a 65-degree difference. If each ice cube cools it by 13 degrees, we divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes. That's 5 ice cubes.

Now, each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. So, 5 ice cubes make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Then, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream. That makes it 15 milliliters weaker too.

So, the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 75"
"So, 5 people go to this record store, and they leave with 7 new records. Now, they gotta trade 2 old records for 1 new one. That means for every new record, they gotta give 2 old ones. 

So, if they got 7 new records, that means they gotta give 7 * 2 = 14 old records. That's how many old records they gotta give."
"So, there's this company with 100 people workin'. They got junior programmers and senior programmers. Junior programmers get paid $2000 a month. Senior programmers get paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they get $2400 a month.

There's 2/5 of the people that are junior programmers. That's 2/5 of 100, which is 40 people. So, there's 40 junior programmers and 60 senior programmers.

Now, let's figure out how much money the company pays to the junior programmers. That's 40 people times $2000, which is $80000.

Now, let's figure out how much money the company pays to the senior programmers. That's 60 people times $2400, which is $144000.

Now, let's add those two numbers together to get the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers. That's $80000 plus $144000, which is $208000.

The final answer is: $208000"
"So, let's figure this out. There's a bus, and people get on and off. At the first stop, 5 more people get on. Then at the second stop, 7 people get off and 8 people get on. Now, there's 20 people left on the bus. We gotta find out how many people were on the bus at the start.

Let's say there's x people on the bus at the start. Then, after the first stop, there's x + 5 people. After the second stop, 7 people get off, so it's x + 5 - 7, which is x - 2. Then, 8 people get on, so it's x - 2 + 8, which is x + 6.

We know there's 20 people left, so x + 6 = 20. To find out x, we gotta get rid of the 6. We do that by subtracting 6 from both sides. So, x = 20 - 6.

x = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he's got 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left. Then he gives 14 to his friends, so he's down to 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops. Now, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave away, which is 2 * 14 = 28. So now he's got 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. Then he eats 3 more that night, so he's got 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops. And then he eats 2 more in the morning, so he's down to 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is: 31"
"So, the phone is at 60% charged, and it needs to be 100% charged. That means it needs 40% more. It charges 1% every 3 minutes. To find out how long it takes to charge 40%, I multiply 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

Now, I gotta convert that to hours. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so I divide 120 by 60.

120 / 60 = 2 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"So Erin has 7 lollipops. Then her mom gives her 10 more. That's 7 + 10, which is 17. Now Erin has 17 lollipops. But then she gives 3 to Ella. So we gotta take away 3 from 17. That's 17 - 3, which is 14.

"So, the customer spent $80 last time and got $1 off for every $20 they spent. That means they got 4 dollars off. 

This time they spent $43 and used that 4 dollars off. Then they got a coupon that was twice as much as the rewards, so that's 8 dollars off. 

So, they got a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dollars off. 

They spent 43 dollars, so they paid 43 - 12 = 31 dollars.

"So, let's figure this out. There's two jobs, and we gotta find out which one pays more after taxes. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and that's in a state with 20% tax. Job B pays $42,000 a year, but there's a $6,000 property tax and a 10% tax on the money left after the property tax.

First, let's find out how much Job A pays after taxes. They make $15 an hour, and they work 2000 hours a year, so that's $15 * 2000 = $30,000. But then they gotta pay 20% in taxes, which is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. So, after taxes, they make $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Now, let's look at Job B. They make $42,000 a year, but they gotta pay $6,000 in property tax first. That leaves them with $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Then they gotta pay 10% in taxes, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. So, after taxes, they make $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, let's see which one pays more. $32,400 is more than $24,000, so Job B pays more.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"So, there's 220 castles in Scotland, right? And 40% of 'em are ruins. That's like, a quarter of 'em, but in percent. So, we gotta find 40% of 220. 

Let's see... 40% is like 4 out of 10, so we multiply 220 by 4 and then divide by 10. That's like, 220 * 4 = 880, and then 880 / 10 = 88. 

Now, we know 88 castles are ruins. But, half of 'em are unmanned. That means we gotta divide 88 by 2. 

88 / 2 = 44

So, there's 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"So, let's figure this out. There's this guy, Robert, and he's lookin' to buy a bookshelf and a sofa. He's got two offers from different places. One's called Furniture United and the other's called Cozy Homes.

Furniture United's offer is $1,350 upfront, and then he's gotta pay $350 every month for 6 months. That's like, $350 times 6, which is $2,100. So, in total, he's gotta pay $1,350 plus $2,100, which is $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer is $1,100 upfront, and then he's gotta pay $250 every month for 9 months. That's like, $250 times 9, which is $2,250. So, in total, he's gotta pay $1,100 plus $2,250, which is $3,350.

Now, let's see how much more one offer costs than the other. It's $3,450 minus $3,350, which is $100.

"So, let's count the guns. DJ got 8, Nick got 10, RJ got 1, and Richard got 5. We gotta add 'em all up. 

8 + 10 = 18
18 + 1 = 19
19 + 5 = 24

Now we gotta share 'em. There's 4 people. We gotta divide the guns by 4.

"Mason needs a lotta sugar to make them suckers and fudge. He needs 30 ounces for suckers and 70 ounces for fudge. 

If he's makin' 8 batches of suckers, that's 8 x 30 ounces, which is 240 ounces. And he needs 70 ounces for the fudge. So, he needs 240 + 70 ounces of sugar. That's 310 ounces."
"So Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for 8 bucks each. Then the price goes up 50% in the first year. That means it's like doubling the price, so now each share is worth 8 + 4 = 12 bucks.

Then in the second year, the price goes down 25%. That's like taking 25% of 12, which is 3 bucks. So now each share is worth 12 - 3 = 9 bucks.

Maria has 8 shares, and each one is worth 9 bucks, so she's got 8 * 9 = 72 bucks."
"So, Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate 3 times more than Luke, so Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs. John ate half of what Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

"So, there's 200 students in a class, and they're split into 3 groups. Two groups are the same size, and the last one's smaller by 10. I'm tryin' to figure out how many students are in the smallest group.

Let's say the two big groups have the same number of students, that's x. Then the smallest group has x - 10 students. We know that all the groups together have 200 students, so we can write an equation: x + x + (x - 10) = 200.

Now, I'm gonna add all the x's together: 3x. And then I'm gonna subtract 10: 3x - 10 = 200. Now, I'm gonna add 10 to both sides: 3x = 210. And then I'm gonna divide both sides by 3: x = 70.

Now, I know the smallest group has x - 10 students, so I'm gonna subtract 10 from 70: 70 - 10 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"

"So Josh starts jugglin' with 3 balls, and then he adds 1 more each week for 4 weeks. That's 3 + 4 = 7 balls. 

Then he drops 3 balls, but 2 people catch 'em, so that's 1 ball gone. 

Now Josh's got 7 balls and he lost 1, so he's left with 7 - 1 = 6 balls.

The final answer is: 6"
"So, there's this frog, a pink one, and it weighs 50 pounds. Now, there's a blue beetle, and it's the same weight as the frog, so it's 50 pounds too. Then there's a green toad, and it's the same as the frog, so that's 50 pounds as well. Now, there's a yellow snake, and it's 10 pounds more than the frog, so that's 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. And then there's a red bird, and it's 20 pounds less than the frog, so that's 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add all these weights together, plus the weight of a container, which is 20 pounds. So, it's 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds.

The final answer is: 260"
"So Laurel got 24 outfits from her friend. Then she got twice as many more at the baby shower, which is 2 times 24, that's 48. Then her mom gave her 15 more. 

Let me add 'em up. 24 + 48 is 72. Then I gotta add 15 to that. 72 + 15 is 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"So, Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run more, 1/5 more. That's like, 5000 plus some more. 

1/5 of 5000 is 1000. That's like, 1000 more meters. So, he needs to run 5000 + 1000, that's 6000 meters every day.

Now, there's 30 days in June. If he runs 6000 meters every day, that's 6000 * 30. That's a lot of running. 

6000 * 30 is 180,000. That's the answer."
"So, you wanna know how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B. Alright, let me think about it. Juice Box A is 4 bucks. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than that, so it's 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. Now, Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so that's 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, I gotta find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B. That's 11 - 9 = 2 dollars. So, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"So, there's this restaurant, right? They got 40 tables with 4 legs each, and 50 tables with 3 legs each. I'm tryin' to figure out how many legs all the tables got in total.

First, I'm gonna count the legs on the 4-legged tables. That's 40 tables times 4 legs, so that's 160 legs.

Then, I'm gonna count the legs on the 3-legged tables. That's 50 tables times 3 legs, so that's 150 legs.

Now, I gotta add 'em together. 160 legs plus 150 legs is... 310 legs.

"So, Jenny buys a bag of cookies, and it's got 36 cookies in it. She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box every day for 5 days, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. Then her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's 1 * 7 = 7 cookies. 

Now, we gotta find out how many cookies are left for Jenny. We already know her son and husband ate 20 + 7 = 27 cookies. So, we subtract that from the total number of cookies in the bag. 36 - 27 = 9.

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"So, Davos bought 2 shirts from the mall. They cost $30 each. He got a discount, 40% off. I don't know what that means, but I think it means he got some money off. 

So, if he got 40% off, that's like, 40 out of 100. That's like 4 out of 10. So, he got 4 dollars off each shirt. 

Each shirt is $30, and he got $4 off, so he paid $30 - $4 = $26 for each shirt. 

He bought 2 shirts, so he paid $26 * 2 = $52."
"So, the factory used to make tractors and now they make silos. They used to sell 10 tractors a day and make $100 each. Now they sell 5 silos a day and make $220 each. I wanna know how much more they're makin' now.

First, I gotta find out how much they made before. They sold 10 tractors a day for $100 each, so that's 10 x 100 = 1000 dollars a day.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day for $220 each, so that's 5 x 220 = 1100 dollars a day.

Now, I gotta find out how much more they're makin' now. That's 1100 - 1000 = 100 dollars more.

Now, I gotta find out what percentage that is. I think I remember doin' this in school... you gotta take the difference and divide it by the original amount, then multiply by 100. So, that's 100 / 1000 = 0.1, and then 0.1 x 100 = 10%.

So, they're makin' 10% more now."
"So, Madeline gotta buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog. Food costs $25 a week. Treats cost $20 a month. Medicine costs $100 a month. I gotta figure out how much she spends on her dog in a year.

First, I think about how much food costs in a month. There's 4 weeks in a month, so I multiply the cost of food per week by 4. That's $25 * 4 = $100.

Now, I gotta add the cost of treats and medicine to the food cost. That's $100 for food, $20 for treats, and $100 for medicine. So, that's $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

Now, I gotta figure out how much she spends in a year. There's 12 months in a year, so I multiply the cost per month by 12. That's $220 * 12 = $2640.

The final answer is: $2640"
"So, Peyton's got a bunch of stuff goin' on after work. Let's see...

Monday, she's doin' yoga for an hour. That's 1 hour.
Then on Tuesday, she's doin' a cookin' class. It's three times as long as the yoga, so that's 3 hours.
Wednesday, she's doin' a cheese-tastin' thingy for half an hour. That's 0.5 hours.
Thursday, she's goin' on a museum tour. It's half as long as the cookin' class, so that's 1.5 hours.
And on Friday, she's doin' errands for 2 hours.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

"April needs 30 pots for the daisies. She needs twice as many for the roses, so that's 2 times 30, which is 60. 

So, she needs 30 + 60 pots in total. That's 90 pots. 

April already bought 100 pots. To find out how many she has left, we gotta subtract 90 from 100. That's 100 - 90. 

The answer is 10."
"So, Andrea had some money, and then she bought a sweater for 11 bucks. After that, she gave her brother 4 bucks. She started with 36 bucks. 

Let's see, she spent 11 bucks on the sweater, so she had 36 - 11 = 25 bucks left. Then she gave her brother 4 bucks, so she had 25 - 4 = 21 bucks left.

Now, I think she saved some money before buying the sweater and giving her brother money. To find out how much she saved, I gotta subtract the money she had left from the money she started with. 

36 (initial money) - 21 (money left) = 15 bucks.

The final answer is: $15"
"So John went on vacation and did some stuff. He spent 6 hours boatin', then he spent half that time swimmin', which is 3 hours. Then he watched 3 shows, and each show was 2 hours long, so that's 6 hours. Now we gotta add all that up: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Now, I know he spent 30% of his time watchin' them shows. That's 6 hours, so I gotta figure out how many hours he was there in total. If 30% is 6 hours, then 100% is... um... 6 / 0.30 = 20 hours. That's how long he was there.

Now, he spent 40% of his time sightseein', and I know he was there for 20 hours. So, 40% of 20 is... 0.40 * 20 = 8 hours. That's how long he spent sightseein'.

"Annabelle wants a phone that costs $400. She already got $80. She works two jobs. At one job, she gets $10 an hour and works 20 hours. That's $10 * 20 = $200. At the other job, she gets $5 an hour and works 15 hours. That's $5 * 15 = $75. She got $200 + $75 = $275 from both jobs. She needs $400 - $275 = $125 more to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"So, there's three trees in this guy Eddy's yard. The shortest one is 6 feet tall. The other one's 5 feet taller than that one, so it's 11 feet tall. 

Now, we gotta find out how tall the tallest tree is. We do that by addin' the two shorter trees together, which is 6 + 11 = 17 feet. 

Then, we gotta multiply that by 2, 'cause the tallest tree is twice as tall as the other two put together. So, 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

So, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

The final answer is: 34"
"So Dean's mom gave him 28 bucks to go to the toy store. He bought 6 toy cars for 2 bucks each, so that's 6 x 2 = 12 bucks. Then he bought 5 teddy bears for 1 buck each, so that's 5 x 1 = 5 bucks. He spent 12 + 5 = 17 bucks total.

Then his mom gave him 10 more bucks, so now he's got 28 + 10 = 38 bucks. Now we gotta subtract the 17 bucks he spent, so 38 - 17 = 21 bucks.

The final answer is: $21"
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. 

Morgan's dad said she got $90 for her birthday party. She wants to do some stuff with her friends. She wants to play mini-golf, which is $5, and she wants to get some arcade tokens for $5. She also wants to ride go-karts, which is $10 a ride, and she wants to ride it twice. 

So, the mini-golf is $5, the arcade tokens is $5, and the go-karts is $20. That's $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. 

Now, we gotta subtract that from the $90. $90 - $30 = $60. 

But wait, Morgan's gonna play too, so we gotta subtract her cost from the $60. $60 - $5 = $55. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many friends she can invite. Each friend is gonna cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 

$55 / $30 = 1.83. But you can't invite a fraction of a friend, so we gotta round down. 1.83 ≈ 1.

But that's not right, 'cause we forgot the arcade tokens. Each friend is really gonna cost $35. 

$55 / $35 = 1.57. But you can't invite a fraction of a friend, so we gotta round down. 1.57 ≈ 1.

But that's still not right, 'cause we forgot Morgan's cost again. The remaining budget is actually $50. 

$50 / $35 = 1.43. But you can't invite a fraction of a friend, so we gotta round down. 1.43 ≈ 1.

But that's still not right, 'cause we forgot the go-karts. The remaining budget is actually $30. 

$30 / $35 = 0.86. But you can't invite a fraction of a friend, so we gotta round down. 0.86 ≈ 0.

But that's still not right, 'cause we forgot the mini-golf. The remaining budget is actually $25. 

$25 / $35 = 0.71. But you can't invite a fraction of a friend, so we gotta round down. 0.71 ≈ 0.

But that's still not right, 'cause we forgot the arcade tokens. The remaining budget is actually $20. 

$20 / $35 = 0.57. But you can't invite a fraction of a friend, so we gotta round down. 0.57 ≈ 0.

But that's still not right, 'cause we forgot Morgan's cost again. The remaining budget is actually $15. 

$15 / $35 = 0.43. But you can't invite a fraction of a friend, so we gotta round down. 0.43 ≈ 0.

"Marisa gets 5 bucks a day from her parents. She buys 4 lollipops for 25 cents each. That's 4 x 25 cents, which is a dollar. So, she spends a dollar on lollipops.

Now, we gotta find out how much she saves. She gets 5 bucks and spends a dollar, so she saves 5 - 1 = 4 bucks a day.

If she does this for 5 days, she'll save 4 x 5 = 20 bucks.

The final answer is: $20"
"So, Billy's dad gave him 10 bucks, and he bought some candy that costs 1.5 bucks a pound. Then he took half his change and spent it on gumballs that cost 0.05 bucks each. He bought 40 gumballs. I wanna know how many pounds of candy he bought.

First, let's figure out how much he spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs for 0.05 bucks each, so that's 40 * 0.05 = 2 bucks.

Now, he took half his change and spent it on gumballs. That means he spent half of the money he had left after buying candy. Let's call the amount of candy he bought 'x' pounds. The candy costs 1.5 bucks a pound, so he spent 1.5x bucks on candy.

He had 10 bucks to start, and he spent 1.5x bucks on candy, so he had 10 - 1.5x bucks left. He took half of that and spent it on gumballs, which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We know he spent 2 bucks on gumballs, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"So, Carver's 45 years old, and that's 5 years less than twice his son's age. Let's figure this out. If we take his son's age and multiply it by 2, that's how old Carver would be if he was 5 years older. But since Carver's 5 years less than that, we gotta subtract 5.

So, if we call his son's age 'x', then 2 times x minus 5 is 45. That's the equation. Now, we gotta solve for x. If we add 5 to both sides, we get 50. That's 2 times x. Now, we gotta get x by itself. If we divide 50 by 2, we get 25.

So, his son's 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"So, the train goes from one city to another, and it's a big trip. It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city. Then it goes 100 miles from the second city to the third city. Now, to get back to the first city, it goes 50 miles less than the sum of the first two distances. 

So, let's figure out how far it goes from the third city to the first city. We add the first two distances: 75 + 100 = 175 miles. Then we subtract 50 miles from that: 175 - 50 = 125 miles. 

Now, we gotta find out how far it goes in one whole trip. We add the three distances: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles. 

The train does this trip three times a day. So, in one day, it goes 300 miles * 3 = 900 miles.

Now, the train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes before needing service, we divide the total miles it can go before service by the miles it goes in a day: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, Mark makes dog beds. He needs 8 pounds of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed, 2 pounds for a chihuahua bed, and for a collie bed, he needs the average of the first two. 

To find the average, you add the two numbers and divide by 2. So, 8 + 2 is 10, and 10 divided by 2 is 5. So, a collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing.

Now, Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. For the chihuahua beds, he needs 4 * 2, which is 8 pounds. For the collie beds, he needs 3 * 5, which is 15 pounds.

So, in total, Mark needs 8 + 15 pounds of stuffing. That's 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"So John's goin' to his friend's house, which is 200 miles away. He's drivin' 70 miles per hour. Then he takes a detour, which adds 10 miles to the trip. So now it's 210 miles to his friend's house.

To find out how long it takes him to get there, we gotta divide the distance by the speed. That's 210 miles divided by 70 miles per hour. That's 3 hours.

Now, he's gotta drive back home. The distance is 240 miles, and he's drivin' 80 miles per hour. So we divide 240 by 80, and that's 3 hours.

So the whole trip took 3 hours to get there and 3 hours to get back. That's 6 hours total.

The final answer is: 6"
"So, there's 96 kids in the fourth grade at Small Tree School. Out of them, 43 are girls. Now, on Friday, some kids were absent. 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. I wanna know how many boys were there on Friday.

First, I gotta find out how many kids were there on Friday. If 9 kids were absent, then 96 - 9 is how many kids were there. That's 87 kids.

Now, I know 43 of them are girls, but 5 of them were absent. So, 43 - 5 is how many girls were there on Friday. That's 38 girls.

Now, I know there's 87 kids in total and 38 of them are girls. So, the rest must be boys. That's 87 - 38. That's 49 boys.

The final answer is: 49"
"So, there's 6 girls in the park. And there's twice as many boys as girls. That means there's 2 times 6, which is 12 boys.

"So, Jane gotta get 42 points to move up to the next school year. She already got 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. I wanna know how many points she needs on the third test.

Let's see... she got 15 + 18 = 33 points so far. To get to 42, she needs to get 42 - 33 = 9 points on the third test.

So, she needs 9 points on the third test.

The final answer is: 9"
"So, like, 3 people got kicked outta Walmart for not wearin' masks. Then, 4 times that many minus 5 got kicked out for stealin'. That's 4 * 3 - 5, which is 12 - 5, which is 7. So, 7 people got kicked out for stealin'.

Then, 3 times the number of people who got kicked out for stealin' got kicked out for bein' violent. That's 3 * 7, which is 21. So, 21 people got kicked out for bein' violent.

Now, we gotta figure out how many people got kicked out for other reasons. We know that 3 + 7 + 21 is 31, and that's not the total. The total is 50. So, we gotta add the number of people who got kicked out for other reasons to 31 to get 50. That's 50 - 31, which is 19.

The final answer is: 19"
"So, Erin got 14 points now. And she got more points than Sara, who got 8 points. It says she got three times more points than Sara. That means Erin got 3 * 8 = 24 points now. But wait, she only got 14 points now. So, she musta had some points before. 

Let's see... Erin's got 14 points now, and Sara's got 8 points. If Erin's got three times more points than Sara, that means Erin's got 24 points now. But she only got 14 points now. So, she musta had 24 - 14 = 10 points before. 

The final answer is: 10"
"So, we gotta figure out how much it's gonna cost to get all them seniors their stuff. We got 44 seniors, and each one gets a picture frame that's $20. That's 44 * 20, which is 880 bucks.

Now, we gotta etch the logo on each frame, and that's an extra 20% of the cost. 20% of 20 is 4, so that's an extra 4 bucks per frame. That's 44 * 4, which is 176 bucks.

So, the picture frames and etching is gonna cost 880 + 176, which is 1056 bucks.

Now, 2 seniors get a pin that's 5 bucks each, so that's 2 * 5, which is 10 bucks.

And then we got the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, and that's 11 people. Each cord is 12 bucks, so that's 11 * 12, which is 132 bucks.

So, we add all that up: 1056 + 10 + 132, which is 1198 bucks.

The final answer is: $1198"
"So, you wanna know how much it costs to make that fancy hand-painted wallpaper yourself? Alright, let me think... 

The store one costs $400. If you make it yourself, you save 20% of that. That's like, a quarter of it, right? So, you save $80. 

Now, if you save $80, that means you only pay $400 - $80 = $320. That's how much it costs to make it yourself."
"So, the shoe store sold some shoes. On Friday, they sold 14 pairs. Then they sold double that on Saturday, which is 28 pairs. Then on Sunday, they sold half of what they sold on Saturday, which is 14 pairs. But then some people returned their shoes, 6 pairs, so we gotta take that away from Sunday's sales. That's 14 - 6, which is 8 pairs.

Now, we gotta add up all the pairs: 14 + 28 + 8. That's 50 pairs. But we gotta remember, each pair has two shoes, so we gotta multiply that by 2. That's 50 * 2, which is 100.

The final answer is: 100"

"So, the company bought some equipment for $400,000. But, some of it was faulty, like 40% of the whole thing. That's a lot of bad stuff. 

To find out how much good stuff they got, we gotta figure out how much the bad stuff is worth. 40% of $400,000 is like, a quarter of it. That's $160,000. 

Now, we gotta take that away from the total. $400,000 minus $160,000 is $240,000. That's how much they spent on the good stuff.

The final answer is: $240,000"
"Mary got 30 sheep. She gets milk from half of 'em, and that's 15 sheep. She gets 1 kg from each of those. That's 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

"So, there's 40 kids in a class. Half of 'em like blue, that's 20. Now, we gotta find out how many like green and yellow. One-fourth of the rest like green. That's 20 kids left, and one-fourth of 20 is 5. So, 5 like green.

Now, we gotta find out how many like yellow. We already know 20 like blue and 5 like green, so that's 25 in total. We subtract that from 40, and we get... 40 - 25 = 15.

Now, we gotta find out how many socks she missed. We gotta take the total number of socks that need washin', which is 50, and subtract the number of socks she already washed, which is 35. That's 50 - 35 = 15.

So, Lindsay missed 15 socks."

"So, Karan borrows 3,650 bucks for 5 months at 10% interest. She gotta pay the same amount every month. 

First, we gotta find out how much she owes in total. We gotta add the interest to the principal. The interest is 10% of 3,650, which is 0.10 x 3,650 = 365. So, the total is 3,650 + 365 = 4,015. But wait, that's not right. We gotta multiply the interest by 5 months, so it's 0.10 x 3,650 x 5 = 1,825. Now we add that to the principal, 3,650 + 1,825 = 5,475.

Now we gotta divide that by 5 months, so she owes 5,475 / 5 = 1,095 per month.

The final answer is: $1,095"

She sells each cup for a buck, so she'll make 36 * 1 = 36 dollars. She spent 18 dollars on stuff, so she's makin' 36 - 18 = 18 dollars.

Now, she sells 4 cups an hour. She's got 36 cups, so it'll take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell 'em all. To find out how much she makes per hour, we gotta divide 18 by 9. That's 18 / 9 = 2.

"So, Mr. Ruther sold some of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. He sold 3/5 of it, so he's got 2/5 left. I think I know how to do this. If he's got 2/5 left, I gotta find out how much he had in the first place.

Let's say he had x hectares. If he sold 3/5, that means he's got 2/5 left. So, 2/5 of x is 12.8. I think I can figure this out.

2/5 * x = 12.8

I gotta get x by itself. I think I can do that by multiplying both sides by 5/2. That's like, the opposite of 2/5.

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land in the first place.

"I'm tryin' to help ya out. So, Monica's got a bunch of gifts to wrap, and she's got 144 inches of ribbon. She's gonna make a bow for each gift. She's got 6 gifts for her family, 4 for her friends, and 2 for her teachers. That's a lotta gifts.

Let's count 'em all up: 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts. Now, we gotta figure out how much ribbon she can use for each bow. We take the total amount of ribbon, which is 144 inches, and we divide it by the number of gifts, which is 12.

144 ÷ 12 = 12

So, she can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"So, let's figure this out. We got a ratio of 5:6 for Betty and Sam's popsicles. That means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. They got a total of 165 popsicles together. 

First, we gotta find out how many groups of 11 popsicles we got. 165 divided by 11 is 15. So, we got 15 groups of 11 popsicles. Now, we multiply 5 by 15 to find out how many popsicles Betty has: 5 x 15 = 75. Then we multiply 6 by 15 to find out how many popsicles Sam has: 6 x 15 = 90.

Now, we gotta find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty. We do that by subtracting the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, Tim's gonna cancel his cable and get them streaming services. He gets Netflix for $10 a month. Then he gets Hulu and Disney Plus, which is $10 each, but he gets a discount 'cause he's gettin' 'em together. That's $20, but he saves 20% on that. 

20% of $20 is like, a fifth of it, so that's $4. So, he saves $4 on the bundle. That makes the bundle $20 - $4, which is $16. 

So, the total he's payin' is $10 for Netflix and $16 for the bundle, which is $26. He was payin' $60 for the cable, so he's savin' $60 - $26, which is $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"So, Carol spends 4 hours writin' a song, then she spends half that time, which is 2 hours, recordin' it. Then she spends 90 minutes editin' it. Now, I gotta figure out what percent of the time she spent editin'.

First, I gotta add up all the time she spent. 4 hours writin', 2 hours recordin', and 90 minutes editin'. I gotta convert 90 minutes to hours, so that's 1.5 hours. Now I add 'em up: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

Now, I gotta find out what percent of 7.5 hours is 1.5 hours. I do that by dividin' 1.5 by 7.5 and then multiplyin' by 100. That's 1.5 / 7.5 = 0.2, and then 0.2 * 100 = 20.

So, she spent 20% of her time editin' the song.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, Wendy's got a shelving thingy with rows and columns, and she wants to put more books in it. It's got 6 rows and 6 columns, so that's like, 6 times 6, which is... um... 36 books already in there.

Now, she wants to put double that, so that's 2 times 36, which is... 72. And then she wants to add 20 more to that. So, that's 72 plus 20, which is... 92.

The final answer is: 92"
"So Erica had 20 Valentine's cards. Then her dad gave her 2 boxes of cards, and each box had 15 cards. That's 2 * 15, which is 30 cards. So now she has 20 + 30, which is 50 cards.

Then she gave some away. She gave 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, so that's 24 + 5, which is 29 cards. She gave away 29 cards, so she has 50 - 29, which is 21 cards left.

Then she got some more cards. She got 17 cards from her family and friends. So now she has 21 + 17, which is 38 cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"So, Jenny's got a pizza with 12 slices. She gives some to Bill and some to Mark. She gives Bill 1/3 of the pizza, which is 4 slices. Then she gives Mark 1/4 of the pizza, which is 3 slices. That's a total of 4 + 3 = 7 slices she gave away.

Then Jenny eats 2 slices. So now we gotta subtract the slices she gave away and the ones she ate from the total. That's 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 slices left.

The final answer is: 3"
"So Mark's got $50 in his bank, and he wants to buy a bike that's $300. He makes $10 a day. To figure out how many days he gotta work to get that bike, we gotta divide the price of the bike by how much he makes a day.

$300 (bike price) ÷ $10 (daily earnings) = 30

So, Mark gotta work for 30 days to save up for that bike."
"So Nancy's cleanin' out her woodshed and she finds 90 spiders. Then she finds millipedes, but not as many as spiders. She finds 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. That's 1/3 of 90, which is 30 millipedes.

Now, she finds stink bugs. She finds twice as many stink bugs as millipedes, but then she takes away 12. So, that's 2 times 30, which is 60, minus 12, which is 48 stink bugs.

So, if she's got 90 spiders, 30 millipedes, and 48 stink bugs, how many bugs is that in total? That's 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"So, let's figure this out. We got this Erica person, and she's 30 years old. Now, there's this other person, Beth, and she's 5 years older than Erica. That makes Beth 30 + 5, which is 35.

Now, there's Alice, and she's 7 years older than Beth. So, we gotta add 7 to Beth's age, which is 35. That makes Alice 35 + 7, which is 42.

Now, we wanna know the difference between Alice and Erica's ages. We just subtract Erica's age from Alice's age. That's 42 - 30, which is... 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"So, John drinks 2 glasses of milk. Each glass is 8 ounces. That's 2 x 8 = 16 ounces. Now, milk's got 3 calories in each ounce. So, if you multiply 16 ounces by 3 calories, that's 48 calories."
"So, the builder works 4 weeks a month, and there's 12 months in a year. That's 4 * 12 = 48 weeks. Now, he works 6 days a week, so that's 48 * 6 = 288 days a year.

He gets paid $50 a day. To find out how much he makes, you gotta multiply the days he works by how much he gets paid each day. That's 288 * 50.

288 * 50 = 14400

The final answer is: $14400"
"So Mark's makin' a big batch of brownies, right? He needs 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Flour comes in 2-cup bags and milk comes in 2-cup bottles. 

First, we gotta figure out how many bags of flour Mark needs. He's makin' 4 times the normal batch, so he needs 4 times the flour. That's 4 * 3 cups, which is 12 cups. Now, we gotta divide that by 2, 'cause that's how much flour's in each bag. 12 divided by 2 is 6. So Mark needs 6 bags of flour.

Now, we gotta do the same thing for the milk. He needs 4 times the milk, so that's 4 * 1 cup, which is 4 cups. We divide that by 2, 'cause that's how much milk's in each bottle. 4 divided by 2 is 2. So Mark needs 2 bottles of milk.

Now, we gotta find out how many more bags of flour Mark needs than bottles of milk. That's just 6 minus 2. 6 minus 2 is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"So, Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. That's a lotta power. If he uses it for 8 hours, that's 900 watts * 8 hours, which is 7200 watts. But we gotta convert that to kilowatts, right? So, that's 7.2 kilowatts.

Now, if he uses it for 3 hours a day instead, that's 900 watts * 3 hours, which is 2700 watts. Convert that to kilowatts, and it's 2.7 kilowatts.

So, the difference is 7.2 kilowatts - 2.7 kilowatts, which is 4.5 kilowatts. That's how much power he saves per day.

Now, if he does this for 30 days, that's 4.5 kilowatts * 30 days, which is... 135 kilowatts.

The final answer is: 135"
"So, there's this Jane, and she's countin' zebras. She's got two zebras with 17 stripes each, one with 36 stripes, and another with half that many. Now, I'm thinkin', how many stripes do these zebras have on average?

First, I gotta count the stripes on the two zebras with 17 stripes each. That's 2 * 17, which is 34 stripes. Then there's the one with 36 stripes. And the other one, it's got half of 36, which is 18 stripes.

Now, I add 'em all up: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes. And I count the zebras, there's 4 of 'em.

So, to find the average, I divide the total stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"So, Tyson's makin' muffaletta sandwiches for the game. He needs to know how much it's gonna cost him. Each sandwich needs a pound of meat and a pound of cheese, and it serves 4 people. There's 20 people watchin' the game.

He needs to make enough sandwiches for 20 people, so he needs to make 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches. That's right, 5 sandwiches.

Now, each sandwich needs a pound of meat, so he needs 5 pounds of meat. Meat costs $7 a pound, so that's 5 * 7 = 35 dollars for the meat.

And each sandwich needs a pound of cheese, so he needs 5 pounds of cheese. Cheese costs $3 a pound, so that's 5 * 3 = 15 dollars for the cheese.

So, in total, he needs 35 + 15 = 50 dollars.

The final answer is: $50.00"
"So, Allan's got a bunch of corn and cannolis. He's got 40 cannolis. That's a lot. He's got twice as much corn as cannolis, so he's got 80 corns.

Then, he goes to the store and buys more. He buys 60 more cannolis and 40 less corns than cannolis. That means he buys 60 cannolis and 20 corns.

Now, we gotta add it all up. He's got 80 corns and 40 cannolis, and then he gets 20 more corns and 60 more cannolis. So, he's got 80 + 20 = 100 corns and 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

So, the total number of corns and cannolis he's got is 100 + 100 = 200."
"So, Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps a day. He did half of that, which is 5,000, goin' to and from school. Then he did another 1,000 steps with his friend. That's 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Now, he had 2,000 steps left to do after his jog. So, he musta done 2,000 steps before his jog, right? But that's not the question. The question is how many steps he did during his jog. 

Let's see... He wanted to do 10,000 steps and he already did 6,000. That means he had 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps left. But he only had 2,000 steps left after his jog. That means he musta done 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

The final answer is: 2000"
"So Toby's got a book that's 45 pages long, and each page's got 200 words. He's gonna read it at 300 words a minute. He's gotta be at the airport in 60 minutes, but it takes him 10 minutes to get there. 

First, we gotta figure out how long it takes him to read the whole book. We do that by multiplying the number of pages by the number of words per page: 45 * 200 = 9000 words. Then we divide that by how many words he can read per minute: 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Now we gotta add the time it takes him to get to the airport: 30 minutes (reading) + 10 minutes (travel) = 40 minutes. He's gotta be there in 60 minutes, so we subtract the time he arrives from the time he's gotta be there: 60 - 40 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, Carolyn works for a delivery service. They hired 40 people in May. Each person gets paid $15 an hour, and they work 40 hours a week. That's 4 weeks in a month, so each person works 160 hours in May. That's 160 * 15, which is 2400 dollars. So, 40 people times 2400 is 96,000 dollars.

Now, in June, 1/4 of the people quit, so that's 10 people. That leaves 30 people. They still work 160 hours a month, and they still get paid 15 dollars an hour. So, 160 * 15 is 2400 dollars. 30 people times 2400 is 72,000 dollars.

So, the company paid 96,000 dollars in May and 72,000 dollars in June. That's 168,000 dollars total.

"Sally went to the beach and her parents gave her 10 bucks. She went to the trinket shop and got some taffy. It was on sale, so she got 2 pounds. One pound was 3 bucks and the other was half off, so that's 1.50. So the taffy was 3 + 1.50, that's 4.50.

She also got a bag of seashells for 1.50 and 4 magnets for 0.25 each. That's 1.00 for the magnets. So that's 1.50 + 1.00, that's 2.50.

Now we gotta add it all up. 4.50 + 2.50 is 7.00. Sally had 10 bucks and she spent 7.00, so she's got 3 bucks left.

"So Tim buys two packs of fireworks. One pack is $400 and the other is twice that, so that's $800. That's a total of $1200 for the fireworks.

Then he buys a finale firework for $150.

Now, he gets a discount on the fireworks. It's 20% off, which is like, a quarter of the price. So, 20% of $1200 is $240. That's the discount.

Now we gotta take that discount off the fireworks. So, $1200 - $240 is $960.

Now we add the finale firework to that. $960 + $150 is $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"So, Shannon wants to know how many cookies she needs to make so she don't run out in 30 days. She eats 2 cookies a night, and she wants to store 'em in the freezer. Her recipe makes a whole bunch of cookies, 12 at a time.

Let's see, if she eats 2 cookies a night, and there's 30 nights in a month, she's gonna eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. Now, we gotta figure out how many batches of 12 cookies she needs to make. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies per batch = 5 batches. Since a batch is 12 cookies, and she needs 5 batches, that's 5 * 12 = 60 cookies. But we already know she needs 60 cookies, so that's right. She needs to make 5 batches of cookies."
"So, Marcy makes candles and she says they won't explode 99% of the time. That means 1% of 'em will explode. Now, 5% of the candles smell like wet dog. But we gotta figure out how many of 'em smell like wet dog and explode.

First, let's find out how many candles smell like wet dog. We take 5% of 50,000 candles. That's 0.05 * 50,000, which is 2,500 candles.

Now, we gotta find out how many candles are the ones that can explode. We take 1% of 50,000 candles. That's 0.01 * 50,000, which is 500 candles.

But here's the thing, 5% of the candles that can explode smell like wet dog. So we take 5% of 500 candles. That's 0.05 * 500, which is 25 candles.

So, 25 candles smell like wet dog and can explode."
"So, Misha buys 4 blouses from a sale. They're 30% off, and each one's regular price is $20. 

First, I gotta figure out how much cheaper each one is. 30% of $20 is 6 dollars. So, each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Now, I gotta multiply the price of one blouse by 4, 'cause Misha bought 4 of 'em. That's 4 * $14 = $56.

"So, Joanne's gatherin' apples from her family's orchard, and her sister comes to help. Joanne gets 30 apples from the big trees, half that from the little trees, and some from the trees that are just right. Her sister gets twice as many from the big trees and three times as many from the little trees. She don't get any from the trees that are just right.

So, Joanne gets 30 from the big trees, and half that, which is 15, from the little trees. That's 45 apples so far. Her sister gets 60 from the big trees and 45 from the little trees, that's 105 apples. Now, let's say Joanne gets x apples from the trees that are just right.

The total number of apples Joanne gets is 45 + x. Her sister gets 105. Together, they get 500 apples. So, 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's figure out x. We gotta get rid of the 45 and 105. So, we do 500 - 150, which is 350. That means x is 350.

"I'm tryin' to figure this out. So, we got a bunch of camels and dromedaries. There's 180 heads and 304 bumps. Camels got two humps, dromedaries got one hump. I think I can solve this.

Let's say we got C camels and D dromedaries. We know there's 180 heads, so C + D = 180. That's one equation.

Now, we know there's 304 bumps. Camels got two humps, so that's 2C bumps from camels. Dromedaries got one hump, so that's D bumps from dromedaries. So, 2C + D = 304.

Now, I'm gonna try to get rid of one of the variables. I can subtract the first equation from the second one. That way, I can get rid of D.

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that I know there's 124 camels, I can plug that back into the first equation to find out how many dromedaries there are.

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there's 56 dromedaries.

Then, he went 30% of that distance for the next 2 days. 30% of 800 is 240. So, he went 240 kilometers for 2 days.

Then, he didn't go anywhere for a day. That's 0 kilometers.

After that, he went 300 kilometers a day for 7 days. That's 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

5 * 4 = 20

Now, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's. So, we gotta multiply 20 by 2 to get Timothy's locker size.

20 * 2 = 40

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."

"So, Bill got a deal on a streaming service. It was 8 bucks a month for the first 6 months. Then it went up to 12 bucks a month for 8 months. After that, it went up to 14 bucks a month. I gotta figure out how much it cost him for 2 whole years.

First, I'm gonna do the first 6 months. That's 6 times 8, which is 48 bucks.

Then, I'm gonna do the next 8 months. That's 8 times 12, which is 96 bucks.

Now, I gotta figure out how many months are left. 2 years is 24 months, and I already did 6 + 8, so that's 14 months. That means I got 24 - 14, which is 10 months left. And that's 10 times 14, which is 140 bucks.

Now, I add all that up. 48 + 96 + 140 is... 284 bucks."
"So, Cole wants to buy some jeans. He gets tattered jeans and jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost 28 bucks. The jogger jeans cost 6 less than the tattered ones. He saved 6 bucks in total. He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered ones.

Let's see... If the jogger jeans cost 6 less than the tattered ones, that means if the tattered ones cost 28, the jogger ones cost 28 - 6 = 22.

Now, he saved 6 bucks in total. He saved 1/3 of that from the jogger jeans, so he saved 1/3 * 6 = 2 bucks from the jogger jeans. That means he saved 6 - 2 = 4 bucks from the tattered jeans.

If he saved 4 bucks from the tattered jeans, that means the tattered jeans cost 28 - 4 = 24 bucks.

Now, we know the jogger jeans cost 22 bucks and the tattered ones cost 24 bucks. So, the jogger jeans cost 24 - 22 = 2 bucks more than the tattered ones.

We got 4 big buses, and each one can hold 60 people. That's 4 x 60 = 240 people.

Then we got 6 little minibusses, and each one can hold 30 people. That's 6 x 30 = 180 people.

And we got 10 minivans, and each one can hold 15 people. That's 10 x 15 = 150 people.

Now, we add 'em all up: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 people.

She's got 3 of the homemade ones, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 birds. And she's got 3 of the store-bought ones, so that's 3 * 20 = 60 birds. 

So, if we add 'em together, we get 90 + 60 = 150 birds. That's how many she can expect to see in her garden each day.

The final answer is: 150"
"So, Aleksandra went to a restaurant and she got some soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. The bagel was 4 bucks. The soup was 25% more than the bagel. That's like, a quarter more. So, it's 4 + 1, that's 5 bucks for the soup.

The cake, it's half the price of the bagel. So, that's 4 divided by 2, that's 2 bucks for the cake.

Now, let's add 'em all up. 4 for the bagel, 5 for the soup, and 2 for the cake. That's 4 + 5 + 2, that's 11.

"Kenny wants to go to the amusement park, and it costs $100. He's gonna sell his Pokémon cards to get the money. He's gonna sell 'em for $1.5 each. He's got some cash already, $50, so he needs to make $50 more. 

Let's see, if he sells 'em for $1.5 each, how many does he need to sell? We gotta divide the money he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5). 

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33. But you can't sell a fraction of a card, so he's gonna sell 33 cards.

Now, Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards. That means he sold 2/3 of 'em. If he sold 33 cards, that's 2/3 of the total. Let's figure out the total number of cards.

If 2/3 of the cards is 33, then we gotta multiply 33 by 3/2 to get the total.

33 * 3/2 = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

That's 18 people with two hotdogs, so that's 36 hotdogs. And then he's thinkin', ""I'll make enough for the other half to have one hotdog each,"" so that's another 18 hotdogs. That's a total of 54 hotdogs.

But then, 40 people show up, and everyone wants a second hotdog. That's 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs. But the caterer only made 54, so that means he's short 26 hotdogs. That means 26 people didn't get a second hotdog.

"So, Charlotte went to the store and she wanted to buy some stuff. She wanted a big set of pots and pans for a hundred twenty dollars, a set of bowls for twenty dollars, and five little utensils for five dollars each. That's a lot of stuff.

First, I gotta add up how much all that costs. The pots and pans are a hundred twenty dollars, the bowls are twenty dollars, and the utensils are five dollars each, so that's five times five, which is twenty-five dollars. So, that's a hundred twenty plus twenty plus twenty-five, which is a hundred sixty-five dollars.

Now, the lady at the store says everything's twenty percent off. I don't know what that means, but I think it means we gotta take away twenty percent of a hundred sixty-five dollars. Twenty percent is like, a fifth, so that's a fifth of a hundred sixty-five dollars. That's thirty-three dollars.

Now, we gotta take away thirty-three dollars from a hundred sixty-five dollars. That's a hundred thirty-two dollars.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"Dora wanna buy some stuff. She got a skipping rope for $6, a board game for $11, and a ball for $2. She already got $2 from her allowance and her mom gave her $16. So she got $2 + $16 = $18.

Now, we gotta find out how much more she needs. We gotta add up the cost of all the stuff: $6 + $11 + $2 = $19. Now we gotta subtract how much she got from that: $19 - $18 = $1.

So Dora needs $1 more."
"So, Prince Thaddeus killed 100 dragons with his sword. Then Prince Arthur, he killed three quarters of that, which is 75 dragons, with a spear. Now, Prince Walter, he killed twice as many as Prince Arthur, so that's 2 * 75 = 150 dragons, with an axe. 

Now, Prince Bruce, he killed one-fifth of what Prince Walter killed, which is 150 / 5 = 30 dragons. He used a nail file, but I don't know why he'd use that to kill dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"So, Josey got 15 gallons of gas and she put it in 5 containers. That's like, 3 gallons in each container. Now, she needs 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. 

First, we gotta figure out what 1/4 of 3 gallons is. I think it's like, 3 divided by 4. That's 0.75 gallons. Now, we gotta turn that into pints. I think there's 8 pints in a gallon. So, 0.75 gallons is like, 0.75 * 8. That's 6 pints.

The final answer is: 6"
"So, George spent 5 bucks and he got 3 bags of chips. Each bag of chips is 40 cents. That's 3 * 40 cents, which is 1.20 bucks. He spent 1.20 bucks on chips.

Now, he had 5 bucks and he spent 1.20 bucks, so he had 5 - 1.20 = 3.80 bucks left. But he only had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. 1% is like 1/100, so 99% is like 99/100. If 1% is 0.01, then 99% is 0.99. So, he spent 0.99 * 5 = 4.95 bucks.

Now, he spent 1.20 bucks on chips, so he spent 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 bucks on candy bars. Each candy bar is 75 cents, so he bought 3.75 / 0.75 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"So Ray had 25 lollipops. He kept 5 for himself. That means he had 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops left. He shared those 20 lollipops with his 4 friends. To find out how many each friend got, we gotta divide 20 by 4.

20 divided by 4 is 5. So each of his friends got 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"So, Rory's got a cake that's 20 ounces. She cuts it into 8 pieces. Then she and her mom each gets a piece. I wanna know how much cake is left.

First, I gotta figure out how much cake each piece is. I do that by dividin' the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces. That's 20 ounces divided by 8. That's 2.5 ounces per piece.

Now, Rory and her mom each got a piece, so I gotta find out how much cake they ate together. That's 2 pieces times 2.5 ounces per piece. That's 5 ounces.

Now, I gotta find out how much cake is left. I do that by subtractin' the cake they ate from the total weight of the cake. That's 20 ounces minus 5 ounces. That's 15 ounces.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, Sitti and Juris got some oranges. Sitti got 34 and Juris got 22. They wanna share 'em with their friends. They got 6 friends, so that's 8 people in total.

They got all them oranges together, so we gotta count 'em. 34 + 22 is... um... 56. Yeah, that's right. They got 56 oranges.

Now, we gotta divide 'em up. There's 8 people, so we gotta give each person... um... 56 ÷ 8. That's like, 7. Yeah, that's right. Each person gets 7 oranges.

The final answer is: 7"
"So, Antoine's makin' french onion soup, and he needs 2 pounds of onions. He wants to double that, so he needs 4 pounds. Onions are on sale for 2 bucks a pound, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 bucks for the onions.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is 2 bucks. So that's 2 * 2 = 4 bucks for the stock.

Now, we gotta add the cost of the onions and the stock together. That's 8 + 4 = 12 bucks.

The soup makes 6 servings, so we gotta divide the total cost by 6. That's 12 / 6 = 2.

The final answer is: $2"
"So Bernadette and Wayne are goin' to the movie premiere. Bernadette wants to get there 5 minutes before Wayne. Wayne's stayin' at a hotel close by, but Bernadette's stayin' in her high-rise apartment. It takes her four times as long to get to the theater as it takes Wayne.

Wayne gets to the theater in 4 minutes. So Bernadette takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get there. Now, Bernadette needs to get there 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. That means she needs to leave 21 minutes before Wayne gets to the theater.

So Bernadette needs to leave 21 minutes before Wayne.

The final answer is: 21"
"So, you wanna know the perimeter of Billie's room, right? Alright, let's figure it out. 

First, we gotta know the area of the room, which is 360 square feet. Now, the length of the room is 3 yards. But we gotta convert yards to feet, 'cause that's what we're workin' with. See, 1 yard is 3 feet, so 3 yards is 3 * 3, that's 9 feet.

Now, we gotta find the width of the room. We can do that by dividin' the area by the length. So, 360 divided by 9 is 40. That's the width.

Now we got the length and the width, so we can find the perimeter. The formula for that is 2 times the length plus the width. So, 2 times 9 plus 40 is... um... 2 * 9 is 18, and 18 plus 40 is 58, no, wait, that's not right. 2 * 9 is 18, and 18 plus 40 is 58, but that's not the right answer.

"So, Elizabeth got some beads. She got 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Each pack got 20 beads in it. So, she got 1 x 20 = 20 red beads and 2 x 20 = 40 clear beads. That's 20 + 40 = 60 beads in total.

Margareth got some beads too. She got 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Each pack got 20 beads in it. So, she got 3 x 20 = 60 blue beads and 4 x 20 = 80 red beads. That's 60 + 80 = 140 beads in total.

Now, I gotta find out how many more beads Margareth got than Elizabeth. That's 140 - 60 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"So, Marcus wakes up and his house is 40 degrees. Then he uses the oven for 3 hours, and it gets hotter by 5 degrees every hour. That's 3 hours times 5 degrees, which is 15 degrees hotter. 

Now, he opens a window for 30 minutes. It gets cooler by 2 degrees every 10 minutes, so for 30 minutes, it gets 6 degrees cooler.

So, we gotta add the 15 degrees it got hotter and subtract the 6 degrees it got cooler. That's 40 + 15 - 6. 

The final answer is: 49"
"So Jon does a triathlon, right? He swims for 40 minutes, rides a bike for 80 minutes, and runs for 50 minutes. That's a total of 170 minutes.

Now, James does the same triathlon, but he's faster in the water. He swims 10% faster than Jon, so he swims for 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes. That's 4 minutes less than Jon.

James also rides a bike, and he's 5 minutes slower than Jon. So, he rides for 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know James swims for 36 minutes and rides for 85 minutes. That's a total of 121 minutes. We also know that James is 10 minutes slower than Jon, so his total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

To find out how long James runs, we need to subtract the time he swims and rides from his total time. So, 180 - 121 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"So, you wanna know how long Movie A is. Alright, let's figure it out. Movie C is 1 hour and 15 minutes, that's 75 minutes. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than that, so it's 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Now, Movie A is one-fourth of Movie B. That means we gotta divide 80 by 4. 80 divided by 4 is... 20. So, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, Michael's horse is racin' and it eats hay. It eats half a bail of hay for every mile it runs. A bail of hay costs 3 bucks. Michael's horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. 

First, we gotta figure out how far the horse ran. Since it ran for 30 minutes, we gotta convert that to hours. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is half an hour. 

Now, we multiply the speed by the time. Speed is 32 miles per hour, and time is half an hour. So, 32 * 0.5 is 16 miles. That's how far the horse ran.

Now, we gotta figure out how much hay it ate. It eats half a bail per mile, and it ran 16 miles. So, it ate 16 * 0.5 bails of hay, which is 8 bails.

Each bail costs 3 bucks, so 8 bails cost 8 * 3, which is 24 bucks.

Michael's got 6 five-dollar bills, so he's got 6 * 5, which is 30 bucks.

Now, we gotta find out how much change he gets. We subtract the cost of hay from the money he's got. 30 - 24 is 6.

The final answer is: $6"
"So Rozanne's makin' eggnog, right? She's got 4 dozen eggs from them cases, and 2 more just sittin' around. Now, I know there's 12 eggs in a dozen, so that's 4 x 12 = 48 eggs from the cases. And then she's got them 2 loose eggs, so that's 48 + 2 = 50 eggs total.

Now, each glass needs 5 eggs, so we gotta divide 50 by 5. That's 50 ÷ 5 = 10 glasses. Now, Rozanne's got these trays that hold 5 glasses each, so we gotta divide 10 by 5. That's 10 ÷ 5 = 2 trays.

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

The final answer is: 2"
"So Joey had 214 points and then he got 26 more. That's 240 points. Marcy had 225 points and then she got 10 more. That's 235 points. Now we gotta find out how many more points Joey has than Marcy. 

240 - 235 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"So, the salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of 'em for $20 each on Monday, which is 17 x 20 = $340. Then he sold the rest to a department store for $25 each. There's 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left. So, he sold 31 x 25 = $775 worth of sneakers to the department store. 

Now, let's add the money he made from both sales: $340 + $775 = $1115. To find out how much profit he made, we gotta subtract the cost of the sneakers from the total money he made: $1115 - $576 = $539.

The final answer is: $539"
"So Beatrice bought ten packets of crayons. Six of 'em had 8 pieces each, and the other four had 16 pieces each. I gotta count 'em all.

First, I count the ones with 8 pieces: 6 * 8 = 48. That's a lot of crayons.

Then I count the ones with 16 pieces: 4 * 16 = 64. That's even more crayons.

Now, I gotta add 'em all together: 48 + 64 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"So, you wanna know the price of popcorn. Alright, let's figure it out. 

You can buy a super ticket for $20, and it comes with a soda and popcorn for $1 extra. Or you can buy a regular ticket for $12 and get a soda and popcorn separately. Now, if you don't get the super ticket and you save $2, that means the extra $1 for the soda and popcorn in the super ticket is actually worth $3, 'cause that's the difference between the regular ticket and the super ticket.

Now, if the soda costs $3, that means the popcorn costs the rest of the $1. But that don't make no sense, 'cause the popcorn can't be worth nothin'. So, let's try again.

If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, that's $15. If you buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, that's $18. The difference between the two is $3. That means the super ticket includes the popcorn for $3, and the extra $1 is just for the popcorn. So, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"So, you wanna know how much it costs to fill 170 balloons. Alright, let's figure it out. 

First, we gotta know how much it costs to fill one balloon. Now, I know that filling 20 balloons costs 900 bucks. So, if we divide 900 by 20, that's how much one balloon costs. 900 divided by 20 is 45. 

Now, the price went up by 20 bucks, so one balloon costs 45 + 20, which is 65. 

Now, we gotta multiply 65 by 170 to find out how much it costs to fill 170 balloons. That's 65 times 170, which is... 11050.

The final answer is: 11050"
"So you wanna know how fast a car went on a trip. Alright, so it went 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, and then 30 miles per hour for 1 hour. 

First, you gotta figure out how far it went. If it went 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, that's 60 x 2 = 120 miles. Then it went 30 miles per hour for 1 hour, so that's 30 x 1 = 30 miles. So it went a total of 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

Now, you gotta figure out how long it took. It went for 2 hours and then another hour, so that's 3 hours total.

Now, to find the average speed, you gotta divide the total distance by the total time. So, 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"So Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Then she trades 3 of 'em for 2 rubies. I don't know what that's worth, but I'll figure it out.

First, I gotta know how much sapphires and rubies are worth. Sapphires are worth 800 bucks each, and rubies are worth 1200 bucks each.

So, Jenna's got 5 sapphires left after tradin'. That's 5 * 800 = 4000 bucks.

Now, she got 2 rubies. That's 2 * 1200 = 2400 bucks.

So, all together, her jewels are worth 4000 + 2400 = 6400 bucks.

The final answer is: $6400"
"So, Marin and his neighbor Nancy, they eat apples, right? They each eat 4 apples a day. I'm thinkin', if they each eat 4, that's like, 4 + 4, that's 8 apples they eat together in a day.

Now, if they do that for 30 days, that's a lotta apples. Let's see... 8 apples a day, times 30 days... that's like, a lot. I think it's... 240 apples.

The final answer is: 240"
"So, Bob's got 10 raised beds, and each one's 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. We gotta figure out how much soil he needs. 

First, we gotta find out how much soil one bed needs. That's 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet. Now, we gotta multiply that by 10, 'cause he's got 10 beds. That's 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Now, each bag of soil's 2 cubic feet, so we gotta divide 320 by 2. That's 160 bags.

Each bag costs 12 bucks, so we multiply 160 by 12. That's 1920 bucks.

The final answer is: $1920"
"So, there's a bunch of cards, and there's 15 red ones. Then there's green ones, and they're 60% more than the red ones. That means if we got 15 red ones, we gotta find 60% of 15. 

60% of 15 is like, 9 more. So we got 15 red ones, and 9 more green ones, that's 24 green ones. Now, the yellow ones, they're as many as the red and green ones put together. So, that's 15 + 24, which is 39 yellow ones.

Now, we gotta add 'em all up, so we got 15 red ones, 24 green ones, and 39 yellow ones. That's 78 cards in total.

The final answer is: 78"
"So, there's this girl Katelyn, and she's playin' with her friends in the school playground. She sees 50 fairies flyin' above the forest. Then, one of her friends sees half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, and they join the ones that were already there. That's 25 more fairies. So now, we got 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

Then, 30 fairies fly away. We gotta subtract those from the total. 75 - 30 = 45.

So, there's 45 fairies left.

The final answer is: 45"
"So, let's figure this out. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of 'em have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of 'em have spots. We gotta find out what percent of all the puppies have spots.

First, we gotta count all the puppies. Jennifer's got 8, and Brandon's got 12. So, that's 8 + 12 = 20 puppies in total.

Now, we gotta count the puppies with spots. Jennifer's got 3, and Brandon's got 4. So, that's 3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.

Now, we gotta find the percent. We take the number of puppies with spots, which is 7, and we divide it by the total number of puppies, which is 20. Then we multiply by 100. That's 7 / 20 * 100 = 35.

So, the answer is 35."
"So the farmer buys a bunch of stuff for his horses. He gets two boxes of sugar cubes, which is 2 pounds. Then he gets 4 big bags of carrots, which is 48 pounds. He gets a whole lotta hay, 42 big bales, which is 3150 pounds. And he gets 20 big sacks of oats, which is 1300 pounds. 

So, we gotta add all that up. 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds. Now we gotta figure out how many times the farmer's truck can carry that much stuff. The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. 

So, we divide 3400 by 2250. That's 1.511. But we can't make a half trip, so we gotta round up. That means the farmer needs to make 2 trips."
"Grayson recycles cans and bottles. She drinks 3 cans of soda and 5 bottles of water a week. Cans are worth 2 cents each and bottles are worth 3 cents each. 

First, I gotta figure out how much she gets from cans. She drinks 3 cans a week, so that's 3 * 2 cents = 6 cents from cans.

Now, I gotta figure out how much she gets from bottles. She drinks 5 bottles a week, so that's 5 * 3 cents = 15 cents from bottles.

Now, I add the two together. 6 cents from cans + 15 cents from bottles = 21 cents a week.

Since there's 4 weeks in a month, I multiply 21 cents by 4. That's 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"So, let's figure this out. We got Frederick, and he's got 10 plants. Now, Toni's got 60% more plants than Frederick. That means Toni's got 60% of 10, plus 10. 

60% of 10 is 6, so Toni's got 10 + 6, which is 16 plants.

Now, Shondra's got 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we gotta take 7 away from 16. That's 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"So, Ali had 21 bucks. Then Leila gave him some money. She gave him half of her 100 bucks. That's 50 bucks. Now Ali has 21 + 50. That's 71 bucks.

The final answer is: $71"
"So, Ashley's pizza delivery costs 15 bucks. She wants to give the delivery man a tip that's 1/5 of that. 

First, I gotta figure out what 1/5 of 15 is. That's like, one part out of five equal parts. So, I'll just divide 15 by 5.

15 divided by 5 is 3. So, the tip is 3 bucks.

Now, I gotta add the tip to the cost of the pizza. That's 15 + 3.

15 + 3 is 18.

So, Ashley should give the delivery man 18 bucks."
"So Finley ran a 100-meter race. She started first, but then she fell back 5 spots. That means she was in 6th place. Then she moved up 2 spots, so she was in 4th place. But then she fell back 3 spots, so she was in 7th place. And then she moved up 1 spot, so she was in... 6th place.

The final answer is: 6"
"So Miss Maria got a lotta cards. She got 6 boxes of basketball cards, and each box got 25 cards. That's 6 * 25, which is 150 basketball cards.

She also got 5 boxes of baseball cards, and each box got 40 cards. That's 5 * 40, which is 200 baseball cards.

So she got 150 basketball cards and 200 baseball cards, that's a lotta cards. She got 350 cards in total.

She kept 50 cards for herself, so she gave the rest to her students. That's 350 - 50, which is 300 cards.

Now, she gave each student 10 cards. So, how many students did she give cards to? That's 300 / 10, which is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"So, Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. Then she got a dollar off. That's like, 100 cents. So, she paid 20 * 45 cents, that's 900 cents. Then we subtract 100 cents, so that's 800 cents. That's like, 8 dollars.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. She got a 10 percent discount. That's like, 10 out of 100. So, we take 10 percent of 1000 cents, that's 100 cents. Then we subtract that from 1000 cents, so that's 900 cents. That's like, 9 dollars.

Now, we gotta find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. That's 9 dollars minus 8 dollars, so that's 1 dollar.

The final answer is: $1"
"So, there's this hotel and they got a lot of laundry. Each room's got 2 sheets, 1 comforter, 4 pillow cases (that's 2 times 2), and 8 towels (that's 2 times 4). 

So, if we count all the stuff in one room, we got 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 things. Now, we gotta multiply that by how many rooms there is. There's 80 rooms. 

15 * 80 = 1200

The final answer is: 1200"
"So, Fireman Frank got 200 shoes. Then he got 5 pairs of shoes on Monday. That's 10 shoes. Then he got 15 pairs on Wednesday, that's 30 shoes. And then he got 30 pairs on Friday, that's 60 shoes. So, he got 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes. That's 300 shoes in total. Then he got rid of 180 shoes on Saturday. So, he's got 300 - 180 = 120 shoes left.

The final answer is: 120"
"Mary's got 6 jars of sprinkles. Each jar can make 8 cupcakes. She wants to use up all the sprinkles. I think she should bake a lot of cupcakes. 

Let's see, if she's got 6 jars and each jar makes 8 cupcakes, that's 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes. Now, I know she can't bake just 48 cupcakes, 'cause that's not how it works. She's gotta bake in pans, and each pan's got 12 cupcakes. 

So, I'm thinkin', how many pans can she fill with 48 cupcakes? I'm gonna divide 48 by 12. That's like, 48 little cupcakes divided into groups of 12. That's... 48 / 12 = 4. 

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes."
"So, Theo bought a pen for 2 bucks. Then she bought a piece of paper. The paper cost a dollar less than three times the price of the pen. Three times the price of the pen is 3 * 2 = 6. So the paper cost 6 - 1 = 5 dollars.

The pen and the paper together cost 2 + 5 = 7 dollars. Theo gave the cashier 10 dollars. So she got 10 - 7 = 3 dollars back.

The final answer is: $3"
"So, there's 30 kids in Marissa's class, and each kid starts with 10 pencils. That's 30 * 10 = 300 pencils. Now, after a couple of months, 1 out of 5 of those pencils are gone. That's 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils. So, we got 300 - 60 = 240 pencils left.

Now, at the end of the year, only 1 out of 3 of those pencils are left. That's 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

The final answer is: 80"
"So Matt wants cookies, but his dad says he gotta eat carrot sticks first. If he eats carrot sticks, he can have half as many cookies as the sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleanin' his room. Matt wants five cookies. 

Let's say he eats x carrot sticks. Then he gets x/2 cookies, plus 2 cookies. That's x/2 + 2 cookies. We know he wants 5 cookies, so we gotta make it equal to 5:

x/2 + 2 = 5

We gotta get rid of the 2 on the left side. We can do that by subtractin' 2 from both sides:

x/2 = 5 - 2
x/2 = 3

Now we gotta get rid of the 1/2. We can do that by multiplyin' both sides by 2:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So Matt gotta eat 6 carrot sticks."
"So, there's this shark, right? It's 10 feet long. And there's these little fish things called remoras, and they're 6 inches long. We gotta figure out what percent of the shark's body the remoras take up.

First, we gotta make the fishy lengths the same. There's 12 inches in a foot, so 6 inches is 6 / 12, which is 0.5 feet. There's two of 'em, so that's 2 * 0.5, which is 1 foot.

Now, we gotta find out what percent of the shark's body the remoras take up. That's 1 foot (the remoras) divided by 10 feet (the shark), which is 1 / 10. That's 10 percent.

So, the answer is 10 percent.

The final answer is: 10"
"So, like, there's this grade level and most kids got a desktop computer at home. But 20 of 'em don't. Now, I'm thinkin', if most of 'em got one, that means some don't. And if 20 don't, that's like, a quarter of 'em or somethin'. 

So, if 20 is a quarter, then I gotta multiply it by 4 to get the whole number of kids. That's like, basic math, right? 

20 * 4 = 80

So, there's 80 kids in that grade level."
"I don't rightly know how to do them fancy math problems, but I'll give it a shot. Jason wants to break in them new shoes in 3 weeks, and he can walk 4 days a week. 

First, we gotta figure out how many days he's got to walk in total. There's 7 days in a week, so we multiply 3 weeks by 7 days.

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, we gotta find out how many days he's got to walk each day. We know he can walk 4 days a week, so we divide the total days by 4.

21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4

"So Sarah spent 300 bucks on books, and each book is 15 bucks. I wanna know how many books she got for her kids. 

First, I gotta find out how many books she bought. I do that by divin' the total amount she spent by the cost of each book. 

300 / 15 = 20

So she got 20 books. Now, she gave 'em to her 4 kids, and she gave 'em the same amount. I just divide the total number of books by 4.

20 / 4 = 5

So each kid got 5 books.

The final answer is: 5"
"So, there's this class with 32 kids, and some of 'em are allergic to dairy, some to peanuts, and some to both. We gotta figure out how many ain't allergic to nothin'.

There's 9 kids allergic to dairy, and 6 allergic to peanuts. But, 3 of those kids are allergic to both, so we gotta subtract 'em twice, 'cause they're counted twice. That's 9 + 6 - 3 = 12.

Now, we gotta take that number away from the total number of kids in the class, which is 32. So, 32 - 12 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, there's this company and they're goin' on a tour. They got 3 groups of people, and each group's got 200 people in it. Then, they got 7 tour guides for each group. I'm tryin' to figure out how many people's goin' on this tour.

So, if they got 3 groups of 200 people, that's 3 x 200 = 600 people. Then, they got 7 tour guides for each group, and there's 3 groups, so that's 3 x 7 = 21 tour guides.

Now, I gotta add the people and the tour guides together. That's 600 people + 21 tour guides = 621 people.

The final answer is: 621"
"So, Tom's gettin' his wife a trip for their anniversary. Plane tickets cost $5000 each, so that's 2 tickets, that's $10,000 right there.

Now, the hotel's a little pricey 'cause it's a busy weekend. It's $1500 a day, but it's 20% more, so that's like, a little extra. Let's see... 20% of $1500 is... um... *tries to calculate*... that's like, $300 more. So the hotel's $1500 + $300, that's $1800 a day.

They're goin' for 3 days, so that's $1800 * 3, that's $5400.

So, the whole trip's gonna cost $10,000 for the plane tickets and $5400 for the hotel. That's $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"So, Ben's got 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper's got half as many blue tubes as Ben, so that's 4 / 2, which is 2. Jasper's got 3 times as many yellow tubes as Ben, so that's 3 * 3, which is 9. 

So, Jasper's got 2 blue tubes and 9 yellow tubes. That's a total of 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

The final answer is: 11"
"So, Belen's got two kinds of pennies. One's from 2010 and the other's from 1959. The 2010 one's heavier, it's like three-quarters as heavy as the 1959 one. And the 1959 one weighs 48 grains.

To find out how heavy the 2010 one is, I gotta figure out three-quarters of 48. That's like, 3 groups of 16, so it's 48. That's 48 divided by 4, and then 3 of those. So, 3 * 12 is 36.

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains. Now, I gotta add 'em together. 36 + 48 is 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"So they wanna know how much more they need to earn. Alright, let's see. Keegan got $83 and Tasha got $91. That's a total of $174. They need $200. To find out how much more they need, I gotta subtract the amount they got from the amount they need.

$200 - $174 = $26

So they need $26 more."
"So Gabriel got a player that can hold 100 songs, and he's got 20 songs on it. Luri got the same kind of player, but he's got 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. That means Luri's got 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Now, Gabriel can put 100 - 20 = 80 more songs on his player. Luri can put 100 - 60 = 40 more songs on his player.

So, Luri can put 40 less songs on his player than Gabriel can.

The final answer is: 40"
"So, Stetson ate some oranges from the 60 they picked. He ate 2/5 of 'em. That's like, 2 parts out of 5. 

2/5 of 60 is... um... 2 times 60, that's 120, and then you gotta divide by 5. That's like, 120 divided by 5. That's 24. So Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Now, he gave up 10 bucks for each orange he ate. So, we gotta multiply 24 by 10. That's 240. 

The final answer is: $240"
"So, Jillian's shoes cost $80. We gotta figure out how much her bag cost. We gotta multiply the cost of her shoes by 3. That's 3 times $80, which is $240.

Now, we gotta take $20 off that. That's 'cause her bag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. So, we do $240 minus $20, and that's $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"So, James runs 12 miles a day, and he does that 5 days a week. That's a lot of runnin'. To figure out how many hours he runs, we gotta know how fast he runs. He runs 10 miles an hour. 

So, if he runs 12 miles a day, and he does that 5 days a week, that's 12 * 5 = 60 miles a week. Now, we gotta find out how many hours that is. We know he runs 10 miles an hour, so we divide the miles by the speed. 

60 miles / 10 miles an hour = 6 hours

So, James runs 6 hours a week."
"So, Uncle Ben got four horses, right? And each horse eats five pounds of oats twice a day. That's like, ten pounds a day for each horse. 

So, if he got four horses, that's 40 pounds of oats a day. Now, he needs oats for five days. That's 200 pounds. 

Now, I know he got these big bags of oats, and each one's got 50 pounds in it. So, to find out how many bags he needs, I gotta divide 200 by 50. That's like, 4. 

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats."
"So Jana got 27 puppies. Now, we gotta figure out how many of 'em are Pomeranians. We know two thirds of 'em are Pomeranians. That's like, 2 out of 3. So we gotta multiply 27 by 2 and then divide by 3.

27 * 2 = 54
54 / 3 = 18

So Jana got 18 Pomeranians. Now, we gotta find out how many of 'em are girls. We know one third of the Pomeranians are girls. That's like, 1 out of 3. So we multiply 18 by 1 and then divide by 3.

18 * 1 = 18
18 / 3 = 6

So Jana got 6 girl Pomeranians.

The final answer is: 6"
"So, you wanna know the average highest temperature of three places, right? Alright, let's see...

There's this place called Southlandia, and it's super cold, like, really cold. The highest temperature they ever had was -48 degrees Fahrenheit. Then there's Northlandia, and it's not that cold, it's actually kinda warm, 21 degrees Fahrenheit. And then there's Midlandia, and it's like, right in the middle, -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

So, to find the average, I'm gonna add 'em all up. -48 + 21 - 3 = -30. Now, I gotta divide that by 3. -30 / 3 = -10.

So, the average highest temperature is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"So the kid wants a toy car that costs 12 bucks. He already got 4 bucks saved up. He's gonna save 2 bucks a day from his allowance. We gotta figure out how many days it'll take him to save the rest.

First, we gotta find out how much more he needs. He needs 12 bucks total, and he's got 4 bucks, so he needs 12 - 4 = 8 bucks more.

Now, we gotta divide the amount he needs by how much he saves a day. He saves 2 bucks a day, so we do 8 bucks divided by 2 bucks. That's 4 days.

So, it'll take him 4 days to save up the rest of the money.

The final answer is: 4"
"So, Jaime's got 64 eggs and he's got 2 trays. Each tray can hold 24 eggs. I'm thinkin', if he's got 2 trays, that's 2 x 24, which is 48 eggs. That's how many eggs he can put on the trays. Now, if he's got 64 eggs and he can only put 48 on the trays, that means he's got 64 - 48 eggs left over. That's 16 eggs. 

The final answer is: 16"
"So Sally buys a small pizza for 8 bucks and a big pizza that's 3 times as much as the small one. That's like, a lot of pizza. 

The big pizza costs 8 * 3 = 24 dollars. I think I got that right. 

So now we gotta add the two prices together. 8 + 24 = 32. That's how much Sally spent."
"So Heather buys razors, and they come in packs of 4. Each pack costs 4 bucks. But they're on sale, so she only pays for one pack, 'cause she gets the other one free. Then she's got a coupon for 2 bucks off. 

So she's only payin' for one pack, which is 4 bucks, and she's gettin' 2 bucks off, so that's 2 bucks. That's how much she's payin' total. 

Now, she's buyin' 2 packs, so that's 8 razors. To find out how much each one costs, I gotta divide the total by the number of razors. So, 2 bucks divided by 8 razors is... um... 0.25. That's 25 cents.

The final answer is: 25"
"So, we got 9 cheerleaders, and 9 out of 10 of 'em are 64"" tall. That means 9 of 'em is 64"", and the other one is 60"". Now, they're gonna build a pyramid, and it's gonna be like this: 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on top of that, 2 on top of that, and the shortest one at the top.

So, the 4 girls on the bottom, they're all 64"" tall, so that's 4 * 64 = 256"". Then the 3 girls on top of that, they're also 64"" tall, so that's 3 * 64 = 192"". Then the 2 girls on top of that, they're 64"" tall too, so that's 2 * 64 = 128"". And the shortest one at the top is 60"".

Now, we gotta add all that up: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"". Now, we gotta convert that to feet. I think it's like, 12 inches in a foot, so we gotta divide by 12. 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"So Charisma works 8 hours a day, and she gets up to walk every hour for 5 minutes. That's 5 minutes a hour, right? So, she walks 5 * 8 = 40 minutes a day.

Now, she does this for 5 days. So, we gotta multiply 40 minutes by 5 days. That's 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"So, Brett is 14 years old now. In four years, he's gonna be 18. That's 'cause you add 4 to 14. Now, in four years, Angela's gonna be three times as old as Brett is now. That means she's gonna be 3 times 14, which is 42. But that's in four years. So, to find out how old she is now, you gotta subtract 4 from 42. That's 38.

The final answer is: 38"
"So, Paul, he drives his car twice a day, right? Once in the mornin', once in the afternoon. He does this for 14 days. Now, I know the mornin' ride costs him 6 bucks, and the afternoon ride costs him 2 bucks.

So, let's figure out how much he spent on the mornin' rides. That's 14 days, and each day it's 6 bucks. That's 14 * 6 = 84 bucks.

Now, let's do the same for the afternoon rides. That's 14 days, and each day it's 2 bucks. That's 14 * 2 = 28 bucks.

Now, we gotta add those two together. 84 + 28 = 112 bucks.

The final answer is: $112"
"So, Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box. That's 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. Then Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she got 50 + 20 = 70 oranges. Now, we gotta add 'em together, so 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Now, we need to know how many pies we can make. Each pie needs 3 oranges. So, we gotta divide 120 by 3. That's 120 ÷ 3 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"So, Mark's tryin' to pick a place for his wife's surprise party. There's two places, and they cost different ways. One place costs $200 no matter how many people come, and then you gotta pay $5 for each person for food. The other place, you pay $25 for each person, but food's already included.

Let's say there's x people comin'. The first place costs $200 + $5x. The second place costs $25x.

We wanna know when they're equal, so we set 'em equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, we gotta get x by itself. We can do that by gettin' rid of the 5x on the left side. We can do that by subtractin' 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Now, we gotta get rid of the 20 on the right side. We can do that by dividin' both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, there's 10 people needed for the two places to be equal in cost.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's figure this out. We got 43 bugs in total. Lily got more than David. David got half of what Bodhi got. 

Let's say Bodhi got x bugs. Then David got x/2 bugs. Lily got x/2 + 7 bugs. 

We know they got 43 bugs in total. So, x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43. 

We can combine the x's: x + x = 2x. And 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation is 2x + 7 = 43.

Now, we gotta get rid of the 7. We can do that by subtracting 7 from both sides. That gives us 2x = 36.

Now we gotta get rid of the 2. We can do that by dividing both sides by 2. That gives us x = 18.

So Bodhi got 18 bugs. David got half of that, which is 9 bugs. And Lily got 9 + 7, which is 16 bugs.

The final answer is: 16"
"So, Mariah's grandma is teachin' her to knit. Mariah used a quarter of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used half a skein. I think I know how to figure this out. There's 364 yards in a skein, right? 

So, Mariah used 1/4 of that, which is like, 91 yards. I counted it on my fingers. And her grandma used 1/2, which is like, 182 yards. I counted those on my fingers too.

Now, let's add 'em together. 91 + 182 is... um... 273. Yeah, that's right. They used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"So Cherrie wants to buy gifts for her 5 friends. 2 of 'em want 5 gifts each, and the other 3 want 2 gifts each. Then she gets 10 more gifts. 

First, we gotta figure out how many gifts the 2 friends want. That's 2 times 5, which is 10 gifts. Then we gotta figure out how many gifts the other 3 friends want. That's 3 times 2, which is 6 gifts. Now we add those together, 10 + 6, which is 16 gifts. 

Then we gotta add the 10 extra gifts she got. So we got 16 + 10, which is 26 gifts. 

The final answer is: 26"
"So, the chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so it's 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.

Now, the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Then, you gotta add 2 more feet to that, so the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

The final answer is: 18"
"So, Suzie bought 4 packs of gum. She got 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum for $2, and 1 pack of green apple gum for half that, so that's $1. She paid $7 in total.

Let's figure out how much the strawberry gum cost. We know the total cost is $7. We know the grape gum cost $2 and the green apple gum cost $1. So, if we add those together, that's $3. That means the strawberry gum must cost $7 - $3, which is $4. But wait, that can't be right, 'cause there's two packs of strawberry gum. So, we gotta divide $4 by 2. That's $2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"I wanna help Frederick make the most popsicle sticks. He's got 24 bucks to spend on wood. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood for 4 bucks, or 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood for 6 bucks.

Let's see, if he buys a 2 x 4, he can get 200 sticks for 4 bucks, so that's 50 sticks per buck. If he buys a 2 x 8, he can get 400 sticks for 6 bucks, so that's 66.67 sticks per buck. I'm gonna round that down to 66 'cause you can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood.

So, the 2 x 8 gives him the most sticks per buck. Now, let's see how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy with his 24 bucks. 24 divided by 6 is 4. So, he can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

Each 2 x 8 piece gives him 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will give him 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"So Mario's got 6 sled dogs, right? And each dog's got 4 legs. That means he's gotta get snowshoes for 6 * 4 = 24 legs. But, he don't need snowshoes for legs, he needs 'em for the dogs. So, he needs 6 pairs of snowshoes. Now, each pair costs 12 bucks. So, 6 * 12 is... 72. No, wait, that's not right. He needs 6 pairs, so that's 12 * 6. That's... 72. No, I mean 12 * 6 is 72, but that's for 6 pairs, so that's 12 * 6. That's... 72. I mean, 12 * 6 is 72. 

The final answer is: $72"
"So, Janet takes the bus a lot. She goes five days a week. Each time she goes, it costs her 2 dollars and 20 cents. I wanna know how much she saves if she buys a weekly pass for 20 bucks.

First, I gotta figure out how much she pays in a week. She goes 5 times a week, and each time it's 2 dollars and 20 cents. So, I multiply 2.20 by 5. That's 11 dollars.

Now, if she buys a weekly pass for 20 bucks, she don't gotta pay 11 dollars. So, she saves... 11 dollars minus 20 dollars... no, that's wrong. She saves 20 dollars minus 11 dollars. That's 9 dollars.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"So, the farm got 30 cows. And the zoo got 20 sheep. Now, the zoo got twice as many cows as the farm. That means the zoo got 2 times 30, which is 60 cows. 

Now, the farm got half as many sheep as the zoo. And the zoo got 20 sheep. So, the farm got 20 divided by 2, which is 10 sheep.

Now, let's count the animals. The farm got 30 cows and 10 sheep, so that's 40 animals. The zoo got 60 cows and 20 sheep, so that's 80 animals. 

So, if we add the animals from the farm and the zoo, we get 40 + 80, which is 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"So, Sophia and Rose went to the market, right? Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Now, we gotta figure out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought. 

Rose bought 4 times as many onions and potatoes as Sophia. That means if Sophia bought x onions and y potatoes, Rose bought 4x onions and 4y potatoes. 

We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. So, we can say 4x = 12 and 4y = 4. 

If 4x = 12, then x = 3. And if 4y = 4, then y = 1. 

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"So, Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by his birthday, which is July 19th. Today is December 31st. He needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound. I'm gonna count the days till his birthday.

December has 31 days, so that's 31 days. 
January has 31 days, so that's 31 more days. 
February has 28 days, so that's 28 more days. 
March has 31 days, so that's 31 more days. 
April has 30 days, so that's 30 more days. 
May has 31 days, so that's 31 more days. 
June has 30 days, so that's 30 more days. 
July has 19 days, so that's 19 more days.

That's 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 181 days.

Now, he needs to burn 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose a pound. So, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find out how many calories he needs to burn each day, I'll divide the total calories by the number of days: 
105,000 / 181 ≈ 579 calories per day.

The final answer is: 579"
"So, Gerald works at a daycare and he gets paid 30 bucks a day. He worked for a whole week, which is 7 days. That's a lotta days. 

So, he gets 30 * 7 = 210 dollars. That's how much he made. Then, he spent 100 bucks. I don't know what he spent it on, but I guess he just did. 

So, to find out how much he has left, I gotta subtract the money he spent from the money he made. That's 210 - 100.

"So Julie had 500 bucks, right? She spent 20% of it on clothes. That's like, a fifth of it. So she spent 100 bucks on clothes. That leaves her with 500 - 100 = 400 bucks.

Then she spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs. That's like, a quarter of it. So she spent 100 bucks on CDs. That leaves her with 400 - 100 = 300 bucks.

So Julie had 300 bucks left.

The final answer is: $300"
"So, you wanna know how much the house cost. Alright, let's figure it out. The house and the lot together cost $120,000. Now, the house is three times as expensive as the lot. That means if the lot cost, say, $x, the house would cost $3x.

So, if we add the cost of the house and the lot together, we get x + 3x = $120,000. That's like, the total cost, right?

Now, we gotta get rid of the x's. We can do that by adding 'em together, so we get 4x = $120,000.

Now, we gotta get x by itself. We can do that by dividin' both sides by 4. That gives us x = $30,000.

Now, we know the house is three times as expensive as the lot, so the house cost 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"So Tara bought 8 packs of bags, and each pack had 5 bags. That's 8 * 5 = 40 bags. She paid 4 bucks for each pack, so she paid 40 * 4 = 160 bucks for all the bags.

Then she sold each bag for 8 bucks. So she made 40 * 8 = 320 bucks from selling the bags.

Now, to find out how much profit she made, we gotta subtract the cost from the money she made. So, 320 - 160 = 160 bucks.

The final answer is: $160"
"So, Joe throws 25 punches a minute.  He fights for 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes.  That's a lot of punches.  To find out how many punches he threw, I gotta multiply the number of punches he throws a minute by how many minutes he fights.

There's 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes, so that's 5 x 3 = 15 minutes.  Now, I gotta multiply that by how many punches he throws a minute, which is 25.  So, 15 x 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"So, there's this bake-off thingy at school, and Kelsie made cookies. She made twice as many cookies as Josh. Josh made a quarter of what Suzanne made. Suzanne made 36 cookies. 

So, Josh made 36 / 4, that's 9 cookies. Now, Kelsie made twice as many as Josh, so that's 9 * 2, which is 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"So Ali got some money, right? He got 4 of them $10 bills, that's $40, and 6 of them $20 bills, that's $120. So he got a total of $40 + $120, that's $160.

Then he gives his sister half of it, which is $80. So he's left with $160 - $80, that's $80.

Now, he uses 3 out of 5 of the money he's left to buy dinner. That's like, 3/5 of $80. Let's see... 3/5 of $80 is $48. So he's left with $80 - $48, that's $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"So, Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. We gotta convert that to minutes, right? 2 hours is 2 * 60, that's 120 minutes. 

Now, Royce takes longer than Rob, like, a lot longer. He takes double the time it takes Rob, plus 40 minutes. So, we gotta double 120, that's 240, and then add 40. 240 + 40 is 280.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

The final answer is: 280"
"So Martha's got three kids, and she's makin' 'em all winter clothes. She's makin' hats, scarves, sweaters, mittens, and socks. Now, I don't know how much wool it takes to make all that stuff, but I'll try to figure it out.

For the hats, it takes 2 skeins of wool per hat. She's got three kids, so that's 3 kids * 2 skeins = 6 skeins.

For the scarves, it takes 4 skeins per scarf. So, 3 kids * 4 skeins = 12 skeins.

For the sweaters, it takes 12 skeins per sweater. That's a lot of wool. So, 3 kids * 12 skeins = 36 skeins.

For the mittens, it takes 1 skein per pair. So, 3 kids * 1 skein = 3 skeins.

For the socks, it takes 2 skeins per pair. So, 3 kids * 2 skeins = 6 skeins.

Now, let's add it all up: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63 skeins.

The final answer is: 63"
"So, Chris gotta do 100 math problems. He does 12 on Monday. Then he does 3 times as many on Tuesday, which is 3 * 12 = 36. So, he done 12 + 36 = 48 problems by Tuesday.

Now, he got 100 problems total, so he got 100 - 48 = 52 left after Tuesday. Then he does 1/4 of the 52 problems on Wednesday, which is 52 / 4 = 13. So, he done 13 more problems on Wednesday.

Now, he done 48 + 13 = 61 problems total. So, he got 100 - 61 = 39 problems left to do on Thursday.

The final answer is: 39"
"So, there's this farm and they're pickin' strawberries. Tony can pick 6 quarts an hour. Bobby, he can pick one less than Tony, so that's 5 quarts an hour. Kathy, she can pick twice as much as Bobby, so that's 10 quarts an hour. And then there's Ricky, he can pick 2 less than Kathy, so that's 8 quarts an hour.

So, if we add all them up, we get: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29

"So, the bakers made 200 loaves of bread. They sold some in the morning, 93 of 'em. Then they sold some more in the afternoon, 39. And then, a store gave 'em back 6 loaves. I gotta figure out how many they got left.

First, I add the ones they sold in the morning and the afternoon. That's 93 + 39, which is 132. Then I gotta take away the ones they sold and the ones they got back. So, I take 200 and subtract 132, and then I subtract 6. That's 200 - 132 - 6. That's 62.

The number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"Jackson's plantin' tulips. He got 36 red ones and 24 blue ones. He can fit 6 red ones in a row and 8 blue ones in a row. 

Let's see, for the red ones, if he got 36 and he can fit 6 in a row, that's 36 / 6. That's 6 rows of red ones.

Now, for the blue ones, he got 24 and he can fit 8 in a row, that's 24 / 8. That's 3 rows of blue ones.

So, he can plant 6 rows of red ones and 3 rows of blue ones. That's a total of... 6 + 3 = 9 rows."
"So, Heather got a big ol' bag of raisins, and it's got 27 cups in it. She wants to make some oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with 'em. Now, a batch of oatmeal cookies needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Let's see, if she's gonna divide the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, that's 3 things. So, each one gets 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins. That means there's 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies.

Now, we gotta figure out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make. Each batch needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins. So, we gotta divide 18 by 3/4. To do that, we multiply 18 by 4 and then divide by 3. That's 18 * 4 = 72, and then 72 / 3 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"So, Ada uses 12 kilowatts of electricity a day. She's gettin' a new thingy that uses 2 kilowatts a day. I think that's a lot. 

First, I gotta figure out how much she uses in a week. There's 7 days in a week, so I multiply 12 by 7. That's 84 kilowatts. Then I multiply that by 1.50, 'cause that's how much it costs per kilowatt. That's 126 bucks.

Now, I gotta do the same thing for when she gets the new thingy. 12 + 2 is 14 kilowatts a day. Multiply that by 7, that's 98 kilowatts. Multiply that by 1.50, that's 147 bucks.

So, the difference is 147 - 126, that's 21 bucks.

The final answer is: $21"
"So, if one person can paint half a house in 5 days, that means they can paint a whole house in 10 days, right? 'Cause if you got half, you gotta double it to get the whole thing. 

Now, if we got 5 people doin' it, it's gonna be way faster. They can paint a whole house in 2 days, 'cause 5 people can do in 2 days what one person can do in 10 days. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many hours that is. There's 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

So, it's 48 hours."
"Ophelia got 20 sofas. She got 2 less chairs than sofas, so she got 20 + 2 = 22 chairs. 

Jenna got 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she got 3 * 22 = 66 chairs. 

Jenna got 2 less sofas than chairs, so she got 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Ophelia got 20 sofas and 22 chairs, that's 20 + 22 = 42 things. Jenna got 64 sofas and 66 chairs, that's 64 + 66 = 130 things. 

So, they got 42 + 130 = 172 things in total.

The final answer is: 172"
"So, Tom bought a CD for 4 bucks, and some headphones. He spent 48 bucks in total. I wanna know how many more CDs he coulda bought if he didn't get the headphones.

First, I gotta figure out how much he spent on the headphones. He spent 48 bucks total, and 4 bucks on the CD, so he spent 44 bucks on the headphones.

Now, if he spent 44 bucks on the headphones, and each CD costs 4 bucks, I can figure out how many CDs he coulda bought with that money. 44 divided by 4 is 11.

But wait, he coulda bought 12 CDs with the 48 bucks he had. So, if he didn't get the headphones, he coulda bought 12 - 1 = 11 CDs.

The final answer is: 10"
"So Josh, he's been workin' out for 8 weeks. Now, he usually works out 4 hours a week, but there's some weeks he works out more. He works out 5 hours for 2 weeks straight, and then there's one week he works out 6 hours. 

Let's see, for the weeks he works out 4 hours, that's 6 weeks. So that's 6 * 4 = 24 hours. Then there's 2 weeks he works out 5 hours, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 hours. And then there's 1 week he works out 6 hours, so that's 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

The final answer is: 40"
"So, there's 48 people on the bus. Then, 8 people get off. That leaves 48 - 8 = 40 people.

Now, 5 times as many people as got off get on. That's 5 * 8 = 40 people gettin' on. So now we got 40 people left + 40 people gettin' on = 80 people.

Then, 21 people get off. That leaves 80 - 21 = 59 people.

Now, it says 3 times fewer people get on. That means 3 times 21 is 63, but that's the number of people that didn't get on. So, we gotta subtract that from 21. That's 21 - 63, but you can't have a negative number of people, so that means 63 more people got on. That's 21 + 63 = 84 people gettin' on.

So, now we got 59 people left + 84 people gettin' on = 143 people.

The final answer is: 143"
"So, Jame is gonna be 27 in 5 years. That means he's 22 now. 

Now, in 8 years, Jame's cousin is gonna be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, in 8 years, Jame's age is gonna be 22 + 8 = 30. Twice that is 60. So, Jame's cousin is gonna be 60 - 5 = 55 in 8 years. 

Now, if Jame's cousin is 55 in 8 years, that means he's 55 - 8 = 47 now.

So, Jame is 22 and his cousin is 47. The difference between their ages is 47 - 22 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"So, Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for 2,400 bucks. He paid 400 less for the printer than the computer. And the computer cost 1,100 bucks. 

First, I gotta figure out how much the printer cost. If the computer cost 1,100, and he paid 400 less for the printer, that means the printer cost 1,100 - 400 = 700 bucks.

Now, I know the computer and the printer together cost 1,100 + 700 = 1,800 bucks. So, the 2 monitors together cost 2,400 - 1,800 = 600 bucks.

To find out how much one monitor cost, I just divide the cost of the 2 monitors by 2. That's 600 / 2 = 300 bucks.

So, one monitor cost 300 bucks."
"So, there's 20 kids goin' on a school trip. They get split into two groups, equal number of boys and girls. They go lookin' for seashells. The boys find 60 shells each. Now, the girls, they find some more. They find the same amount as the boys, plus four times as many as the boys.

So, the boys find 60 shells each, that's 10 boys, that's 600 shells. Now, the girls find 60 more than that, plus four times 60. That's 60 + 240, that's 300 more. So, the girls find 600 + 300, that's 900 shells.

Now, there's 10 girls, so each girl finds 900 / 10, that's 90 shells.

The final answer is: 90"
"So, let's figure this out. George had some candies, and then he ate 5. Now he's got 3 left. That means before he ate 5, he had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

"So, my wife wants me to pay the bill and then give an extra 20% on top of that. The bill is $50. 

20% of $50 is like, um, 20 cents for every dollar. So, 20 cents times 50 dollars is... 10 dollars. 

So, I gotta pay the original $50 and then add the extra $10. That's $60."
"So, let's figure this out. 

First, we gotta find out how much the eldest boy got. We know he got a part of $18, and there's 3 of 'em. So, we divide $18 by 3, and that's $6. That's what he got.

Then, he adds $5 to that, so now he's got $6 + $5 = $11.

Next, he adds another $10, so now he's got $11 + $10 = $21.

But then, he spends $8, so now he's got $21 - $8 = $13.

"So, Elvis wants to save some money, and he's got a goal of $1125 for the month. He wants to save more in the second half of the month than he does in the first half. He wants to save twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half.

Let's see... If he's saving twice as much in the second half, that means he's saving half as much in the first half. So, if we call the amount he saves in the first half ""x"", then he's saving 2x in the second half.

Now, let's think about it. He's got 30 days in April. If he's saving half as much in the first half, that means he's saving half of 30 days, which is 15 days. So, he's saving in the first half for 15 days.

Now, let's think about how much he's saving each day in the first half. If he's saving a total of $1125 for the month, and he's saving for 15 days in the first half, that means he's saving $1125 / 15 = $75 per day in the first half.

But, he's saving twice as much in the second half, so he's saving $75 x 2 = $150 per day in the second half.

"So Verna bought some fruits. She got 3 apples for $1.50 each, 5 oranges for $0.80 each, and 6 peaches for $0.75 each. She gave the store 20 bucks. I gotta figure out how much change she got back.

First, I'll add up the cost of the apples. 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x 1.50, that's 4.50 dollars.

Next, I'll add up the cost of the oranges. 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x 0.80, that's 4 dollars.

Now, I'll add up the cost of the peaches. 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x 0.75, that's 4.50 dollars.

Now, I add all the costs together: 4.50 + 4 + 4.50 = 13 dollars.

So, Verna gave the store 20 bucks, and she spent 13 bucks on fruits. To find out how much change she got, I'll subtract 13 from 20. That's 20 - 13 = 7 dollars.

"So, Jeff and Brad are divvying up 100 bucks. Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. I'm thinkin', if Brad gets some amount, let's call it x, then Jeff gets 4x.

So, if we add what they both get, it's gotta be 100. That's like, the whole pie. So, we got x + 4x = 100.

Now, I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I think it means we gotta add the x's together. So, that's 5x. And if we got 5x, that's like, 5 times x. And if that's 100, then we gotta divide 100 by 5 to find out what x is.

So, 100 divided by 5 is 20. That means x is 20. And since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, that means Jeff gets 4 * 20, which is... 80.

So, Jeff gets 80 bucks.

"So, Daniel wants to buy some stuff from the shop. He wants 5 notebooks for $1.50 each, 2 pens for $0.25 each, 1 calculator for $12, and 1 geometry set for $10. 

First, let's add up the cost of all the notebooks: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50. Then, we add the cost of the pens: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. Now, we add the cost of the calculator and the geometry set: $12 + $10 = $22. 

Now, we add all these costs together: $7.50 + $0.50 + $22 = $30. 

But, the shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. 10% of $30 is $3. So, we subtract $3 from $30 to get the final cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

Now, if she sells more than $1000, she gets an extra 10% on the extra amount. So, if she sells $2500, that's $1500 more than $1000. 10% of $1500 is $150. 

So, she gets $300 from the first $1000 and $150 from the extra $1500. That's a total of $450."

Now, Peter's locker is a quarter of Zack's, so we gotta divide 12 by 4. That's like, 12, 3, 0.25, no, that's not right. You gotta keep goin' down, 12, 6, 3. So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"So, Juan drinks a lot of coffee, and his doctor says he gotta cut back. Octavia, his wife, she drinks half the amount of coffee that's good for her. And Juan, he drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks. 

Let's figure out how much coffee Octavia drinks. If she drinks half the good amount, and the good amount is 4 cups, then she drinks 4 / 2 = 2 cups.

Now, Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, so he drinks 10 * 2 = 20 cups.

His doctor says he should drink 4 cups, so he needs to cut back 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

The answer is 16."
"So, the pet shop had 6 cages. 3 of 'em had hamsters, and 3 had guinea pigs. Now, let's count 'em.

There's 3 cages with hamsters, and each cage has 10 hamsters. That's 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters.

And then there's 3 cages with guinea pigs, and each cage has 5 guinea pigs. That's 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Now, let's add 'em together. 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.

The final answer is: 45"
"So, let's figure this out. Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so she weighs 150 - 20, that's 130 pounds. Now, Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs 2 * 130, that's 260 pounds.

Now we gotta find the total weight of all three. We add 'em up: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

Now we gotta find the average. We take the total weight and divide it by 3. That's 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The final answer is: 180"
"So, the sun starts at the top of the pyramid, and it moves up 5 degrees every hour. It moves for 10 hours. I think we gotta add the hours it moves to the degrees it moves per hour. That's 5 degrees an hour * 10 hours, which is 50 degrees. 

Now, we gotta add the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees. So, 32 + 50 is 82 degrees. That's how much the sun will be from the ground.

The final answer is: 82"
"So James is buyin' candles for his two kids. One's 12 and the other's 4 years younger, so that's 8. They need one candle per year, so they need 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, I know a pack of candles costs 3 bucks and it's got 5 candles in it. To find out how many packs James needs, I'll divide 20 by 5. That's 4 packs.

So James needs 4 packs of candles. And since each pack costs 3 bucks, he's gonna spend 4 * 3 = 12 bucks.

The final answer is: $12"
"So, Judy reads for 15 minutes every night, and there's 7 nights in a week. That's 15 * 7 = 105 minutes. Now, I gotta figure out how many pages she read in that time. She can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. So, I need to find out how many 1.5 minute chunks are in 105 minutes. That's 105 / 1.5 = 70. Now, she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, so she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

Then, in the second week, she read 100 pages. So, in two weeks, she read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"So, Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third of 'em, and Trevor ate a quarter. 

To figure out how many Cody ate, I'd divide 12 by 3. That's 4 sandwiches.

Now, Trevor ate a quarter, so I'd divide 12 by 4. That's 3 sandwiches.

So, together they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

Now, to find out how many are left, I'd subtract 7 from 12. That's 5 sandwiches.

The final answer is: 5"
"So, Shiloh is 44 years old now. In 7 years, he's gonna be 51. That's 'cause you add 7 to 44. 

Now, in 7 years, his nephew's age is gonna be some number. Let's call that number x. So, in 7 years, the nephew's age will be x + 7.

Now, the problem says that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. That means 51 is three times x + 7. 

So, I'm gonna divide 51 by 3 to find out what three times x + 7 is. That's 17. 

Now, I need to find out what x + 7 is equal to 17. So, I'm gonna subtract 7 from 17. That's 10.

So, the nephew is 10 years old now.

The final answer is: 10"
"So, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $5 for the first tooth. Then, she gave her $1 for each of the next three teeth, so that's 3 * $1 = $3. Then, for the last two teeth, she gave her half of what she gave for the first three, which is $1 / 2 = $0.50. So, for the last two teeth, she gave her 2 * $0.50 = $1.

Now, let's add it all up: $5 + $3 + $1 = $9.

The final answer is: $9"
"So, there's three teenagers playin' soccer, right? One of 'em, Richie, he scored 80 goals. Now, I know he scored more than the other two. He scored 20 more than Mark, and 45 more than Anna.

Let's figure out how many goals Mark scored. If Richie scored 20 more than Mark, that means Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.

Now, let's figure out how many goals Anna scored. If Richie scored 45 more than Anna, that means Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Now, let's add up all their goals. Richie scored 80, Mark scored 60, and Anna scored 35. So, the total number of goals is 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"So, Liam and Mitchell, they got lemonade stands across the street from each other. Liam says he made 63 bucks one weekend. Mitchell says he sold 21 lemonades for 4 bucks each. I wanna know how much more Mitchell made than Liam.

First, I gotta figure out how much Mitchell made. He sold 21 lemonades for 4 bucks each, so that's 21 * 4 = 84 bucks.

Now, I gotta subtract how much Liam made from how much Mitchell made. So, 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"So Peter's got 70 bucks, and he wants to spend it all in a week. He buys wooden action figures for 5 bucks each on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. That's 4 days, so he spent 4 * 5 = 20 bucks on those wooden action figures. He bought 20 / 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

Now, he's got 70 - 20 = 50 bucks left. He's gonna spend it on plastic action figures, which cost 2 bucks each. He's got 5 days left, so he can buy 50 / 2 = 25 plastic action figures.

So, he's got 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures. That's a total of 4 + 25 = 29 action figures.

The final answer is: 29"
"So Leah got a new kitten. She had to pay to get it spayed, that cost 200 bucks. Then she had to get it some shots, and that cost 20 bucks a pop, so that's 3 shots, that's 60 bucks. And the little guy, it broke 4 vases, and each vase cost 12 bucks, so that's 48 bucks.

"So, Ford grows roses and he sells 'em to the shops. He grows 40 roses a week. The first shop wants 20, the second shop wants 15, and the third shop wants 30. That's a lot of roses. 

Let me count it. 20 + 15 + 30 is 65 roses a week. Now, there's 4 weeks in a month, so I gotta multiply that by 4. 65 * 4 is 260 roses a month. 

Ford grows 40 roses a week, so that's 40 * 4, which is 160 roses a month. Now, I gotta find out how many roses he's short. So, I subtract 160 from 260. That's 260 - 160, which is 100. 

The final answer is: 100"
"So Katina got $3000 in her bank. She takes out $100 every month. I wanna know how much she'll have left after 2 years.

There's 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, that's 24 months. She takes out $100 each month, so she takes out 24 x $100 = $2400 in 2 years.

She started with $3000, and she took out $2400, so she's got $3000 - $2400 = $600 left.

The final answer is: $600"
"So, you wanna know how much profit a food truck makes sellin' grilled cheeses. They buy bread for $3 a loaf and it makes 10 sandwiches. They spend $30 on cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7 each.

First, you gotta figure out how much they spend. They need 1 loaf of bread for 10 sandwiches, so that's $3. Then they need cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches, which is $30. So, they spend $3 + $30 = $33.

Now, they sell 10 sandwiches for $7 each, so they make $70.

To find the profit, you gotta subtract how much they spent from how much they made. So, $70 - $33 = $37.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"So Kate got 3 boxes of crayons, and each box has 64 crayons. That's a lotta crayons. She wants to melt 'em down and make muffin crayons. She puts 8 crayons in a muffin tin and puts it in the oven. Then she sells 'em for $1.50 each.

First, we gotta figure out how many muffin crayons she can make. She's got 192 crayons, and she uses 8 for each muffin crayon. So, we divide 192 by 8. That's 24 muffin crayons.

Now, we gotta figure out how much money she can make. She's selling each muffin crayon for $1.50. So, we multiply 24 by $1.50. That's $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"So, Michael's gettin' new carpet. He's got a room that's 18 feet by 12 feet. He's gonna need to know how much it's gonna cost him. 

First, we gotta figure out how much carpet he needs. That's 18 times 12, which is 216 square feet. Now, the carpet costs $12 a square foot, so that's 216 times 12, which is $2592. Then there's the padding, which is $2 a square foot, so that's 216 times 2, which is $432. 

Now, the old carpet's gotta go, and that's gonna cost him $4 a square foot, so that's 216 times 4, which is $864. And then there's the new carpet gettin' put in, which is $34 a square foot, so that's 216 times 34, which is $7344.

Now, let's add up the cost of the carpet and padding, which is $2592 + $432, that's $3024. Then we add the cost of removin' the old carpet, which is $864, so that's $3888. And then we add the cost of puttin' in the new carpet, which is $7344. That's a total of $3888 + $7344, which is $11232.

But wait, I made a mistake, I forgot to add the cost of the new carpet itself. That's $2592, so that's $11232 + $2592, which is $13824.

The final answer is: $13824"
"So, Mack wants to know how many birds he saw on average. He saw 50 birds on the first two days. Then, on the third day, he saw none. On the fourth and fifth days, he saw 120 birds. On the sixth day, he saw 20 birds, and on the seventh day, he saw 90 birds. 

To find the average, we gotta add up all the birds he saw and then divide by the number of days. 

50 + 0 = 50
50 + 120 = 170
170 + 20 = 190
190 + 90 = 280

So, he saw a total of 280 birds. There are 7 days. 

280 / 7 = 40

"So, Maggie's oven is broke. It says 450 but it's really 468. That's like, 18 degrees more. To find out how much more it's off, we gotta divide 18 by 450. That's like, 18 divided by 450. That's 0.04. Multiply that by 100 and you get 4. So it's off by 4%.

Now, Maggie's got a recipe that says 520. We gotta find out what she should set it to. We take 4% of 520. That's like, 4 out of 100, so it's 0.04. Multiply that by 520 and you get 20.8. That's how much more it's off. So, we gotta subtract that from 520. That's 520 minus 20.8. That's 499.2.

So, Maggie should set it to 499."
"So, Max is gonna watch two movies this weekend. The first one is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. That's like, 60 minutes plus 30 minutes, so that's 90 minutes. The second one is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. That's 120 minutes plus 5 minutes, so that's 125 minutes.

"So, Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts. Each box lasts him 45 days and has 90 contacts. That means he uses 2 contacts a day. He's gonna use 180 contacts in total.

Each box costs $100, but it's on sale for 10% off. That's like, a discount, right? So, he pays $100 for each box, but he gets $20 off. That's $80 per box. He buys 2 boxes, so that's $160.

Now, we gotta find out how much each contact costs. He's got 180 contacts, and he paid $160. So, we divide $160 by 180 contacts. That's like, $160 divided by 180. That's $0.89.

"So, Tabitha paid John and Jill $10 an hour to clean her attic and basement. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. That's 3 hours total. She gets $10 an hour, so she made $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. And he worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours. He gets $10 an hour, so he made $70.

Now, to find out how much more John made than Jill, we gotta subtract Jill's money from John's money. That's $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"So, Hannah does some aerobics and runs. She burns calories, and she needs to drink water for every 200 calories she burns. She burns calories from aerobics and running. Aerobics burns 500 calories an hour, and she does it for 2 hours. That's 500 * 2 = 1000 calories. Running burns 600 calories an hour, and she does it for 1 hour. That's 600 * 1 = 600 calories. So, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Now, she needs to drink water for every 200 calories. So, we need to divide 1600 by 200. That's 1600 / 200 = 8. That means she needs to drink water 8 times. And each time she drinks 100 ml of water. So, she needs to drink 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

"So, there's this jar with jelly beans in it. It's got red, blue, and green ones. There's a note on the jar that says there's 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones. And there's a total of 4500 jelly beans in the jar.

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B. Then the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (that's 1% less than B), and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B (that's 1% more than B).

We know that B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500. That's because there's a total of 4500 jelly beans. 

Now, let's add those numbers together: 0.99 + 1.01 is 2.00, so we can say 2.00B = 4500. 

Now, we gotta get B by itself. We do that by dividing both sides by 2.00. That's like, 4500 divided by 2.00, which is 2250. So B is 2250.

Now that we know B, we can find out how many red and green jelly beans there are. The number of red jelly beans is 0.99 * 2250, which is 2224.5. But we can't have half a jelly bean, so we'll just say it's 2225. The number of green jelly beans is 1.01 * 2250, which is 2275.5. But again, we can't have half a jelly bean, so we'll just say it's 2275.

Now, let's find out how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans. That's 2275 - 2225, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"

Then she calls up 10 of her friends and 8 of 'em say they're bringin' their spouses. That's 10 + 8, that's 18 more people.

So now we gotta add all them people together. 300 + 18 is 318. But we gotta remember Alex herself is comin', so we gotta add 1 more. That's 319.

Now, I see these same boots on eBay, and they're only 13 bucks. But the shipping is twice as much as on Amazon, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 bucks.

So, the boots on eBay are 13 + 8 = 21 bucks total.

Now, I wanna know how much more expensive they are on eBay. So, I take the total cost on eBay and subtract the total cost on Amazon: 21 - 20 = 1.

"So, John eats 200 grams of mushrooms a day. And a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein. To find out how much protein he gets, we gotta figure out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms.

If 100 grams of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, then we gotta multiply the grams of mushrooms he eats by the grams of protein in 100 grams. So, 200 grams * 3 grams of protein in 100 grams is... 200 * 3 = 600. But that's not right, that's too much. We gotta divide by 2, 'cause 200 is twice 100. So, 200 * 3 / 2 = 300. But that's still not right, we gotta divide by 2 again, 'cause we're only using half of the 100 grams. So, 300 / 2 = 150. No, that's still not right. I think I got it now. We gotta multiply 200 by 3 and then divide by 100. That's 600 / 100 = 6. So, John gets 6 grams of protein a day.

Now, we gotta multiply that by 7, 'cause there's 7 days in a week. 6 * 7 = 42. So, John gets 42 grams of protein a week.

The final answer is: 42"
"So, Jerry's age is a mystery, but we know he's twice as old as he was 5 years ago. That means if he was, say, 5 years old 5 years ago, he's 10 now. But we don't know that for sure. Let's just say he's x years old now.

So, x is equal to 2 times x minus 5. That's like, x = 2x - 5. We gotta get x by itself, so we subtract 2x from both sides. That leaves us with -x = -5. Now we gotta get rid of the negative sign, so we multiply both sides by -1. That gives us x = 10.

So Jerry's 10 years old now. In 3 years, he'll be 10 + 3 = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"So George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each one costs 2000 bucks. But one of 'em, he wants a fancy crown on it, that's an extra 500 bucks. He already put down 600 bucks. He makes 15 bucks an hour at work.

First, we gotta figure out how much he owes. He owes 2000 for the first implant, and 2000 for the second one, that's 4000 bucks. Then he owes 500 for the crown, so that's 4500 bucks total. But he already paid 600 bucks, so he owes 4500 - 600 = 3900 bucks.

Now we gotta figure out how many hours he needs to work to pay for it. He makes 15 bucks an hour, so we divide 3900 by 15. That's 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"So, you got this problem about a triangle, right? It says the three angles add up to 180 degrees. One angle is twice the smallest one, and one angle is three times the smallest one. I'm gonna try to figure it out.

Let's say the smallest angle is x. That means the other angle is 2x, and the other one is 3x. Now, we gotta add 'em all up. So, it's x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Now, I'm gonna combine the x's. That's like, x + x + x, so it's 6x. So now we got 6x = 180.

Now, I'm gonna divide both sides by 6. That's like, if I got 12 cookies and I wanna know how many cookies I got per bag, I'd divide by 6. So, 180 divided by 6 is 30. That means x is 30.

Now, I know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. That means the other angle is 2x, which is 2(30) = 60. And the other one is 3x, which is 3(30) = 90.

So, the biggest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"So Colby's got some money, and he wants to buy gumballs that cost a nickel each. He's got 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies. Let's count the money.

8 quarters is 8 x 25 cents, that's 200 cents. 6 dimes is 6 x 10 cents, that's 60 cents. 14 nickels is 14 x 5 cents, that's 70 cents. And 15 pennies is 15 x 1 cent, that's 15 cents.

Now, let's add all that up. 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 is 345 cents. Now we gotta figure out how many gumballs he can buy with that.

Each gumball costs 5 cents, so we gotta divide 345 by 5. That's 69. So Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

The final answer is: 69"
"So, there's a pet store with dogs, cats, and birds. I'm tryin' to figure out how many legs they all got. 

Dogs got 4 legs each, and there's 5 of 'em, so that's 5 x 4 = 20 legs. 

Cats got 4 legs too, and there's 2 of 'em, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 legs.

Birds got 2 legs, and there's 10 of 'em, so that's 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 20 + 8 + 20 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"So Jamaal's usin' an 8-pound weight, right? Then he makes it heavier by 50%. That means he adds half of 8 pounds to it. Half of 8 is 4, so he adds 4 pounds. Now he's usin' 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

But then he says it's too heavy, so he takes 2 pounds off. That means he's usin' 12 - 2 = 10 pounds now.

The final answer is: 10"
"So, Steve gets a console and 5 games for his birthday. Then he saves up money to buy 1 game a month for a year, that's 12 games. Then he starts buyin' 2 games a month for a year, that's 24 games. Then he gets a new job and starts buyin' 4 games a month for a year, that's 48 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year. 

So, in the first year, he gets 5 birthday games and 5 Christmas games, that's 10 games. Then he gets 12 more from savin' up. That's 22 games.

In the second year, he gets 5 birthday and Christmas games, that's 10 games. Then he gets 24 more from buyin' 2 games a month. That's 34 games.

In the third year, he gets 5 birthday and Christmas games, that's 10 games. Then he gets 48 more from buyin' 4 games a month. That's 58 games.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 22 + 34 + 58 = 114. No, wait, that's not right. I made a mistake. Let me try again. 22 + 34 = 56. Then 56 + 58 = 114. No, I did it again. Let me try once more. 22 + 34 = 56. Then 56 + 58 = 114. I'm pretty sure that's right this time.

The final answer is: 114"
"So, you wanna know how long it takes for a plane to fly 2000 miles if it already flew 1200 miles in 3 hours. 

First, we gotta figure out how fast the plane is goin'. If it flew 1200 miles in 3 hours, that means it's flyin' 1200 / 3 = 400 miles per hour. 

Now, we wanna know how long it takes to fly 2000 miles at that speed. We just divide 2000 by 400. That's 2000 / 400 = 5 hours.

So, it's gonna take 5 hours to fly 2000 miles.

The final answer is: 5"
"So, Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. That's like, a lot of chocolates. I think he makes 60 pounds in 1 hour. 

Now, Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in an hour. That's like, 3/4 of 60. I think that's 45 pounds. 

So, if they work for 12 hours, Ruiz makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates. And Marissa makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

They make a lot of chocolates together. Let's add 'em up. 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds of chocolates.

The final answer is: 1260"
"So Howard goes to the arcade on Monday and spends 8 bucks. Then on Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, so that's 2 * 8 = 16 bucks. Then on Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, so that's 4 * 16 = 64 bucks.

So he spent 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 bucks total. He started with 100 bucks, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from the original amount: 100 - 88 = 12 bucks.

"So, Patrick sold lemonade. He sold it for 4 hours at first, and then for 2 more hours. 

He sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour for the first 4 hours. That's 15 * 4 = 60 cups. He sold each cup for 50 cents. So, he made 60 * 0.50 = 30 dollars in the first 4 hours.

Then, he sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour for the next 2 hours. That's 10 * 2 = 20 cups. He sold each cup for 60 cents. So, he made 20 * 0.60 = 12 dollars in the next 2 hours.

So, in total, he made 30 + 12 = 42 dollars.

The final answer is: $42"
"So, Jeremy's car goes 400 miles a month, and the tires go 725 times around for every 2 miles. That's a lotta goin's around. 

First, we gotta figure out how many times the tires go around in a month. We do that by multiplyin' the miles by the rotations. So, 400 miles times 725 rotations is... 290,000 rotations a month.

Now, we gotta know how many times the tires can go around before they need to be replaced. That's 10,440,000 times. 

To find out how many months that is, we divide the total rotations by the monthly rotations. That's 10,440,000 divided by 290,000. That's 36 months.

Now, we gotta turn that into years. There's 12 months in a year, so we divide 36 by 12. That's 3 years.

So, the tires will last 3 years before they need to be replaced.

The final answer is: 3"
"So, you wanna know how much one pump of shampoo costs. Alright, so the big bottle costs 24 bucks, and it says to use 2 pumps for 120 washes. But Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash. 

First, we gotta figure out how many pumps are in the bottle. If 2 pumps do 120 washes, then 1 pump does 120 / 2 = 60 washes. So, there's 120 * 2 = 240 pumps in the bottle.

Now, we gotta find out how much one pump costs. The bottle costs 24 bucks, which is 2400 cents. So, we divide 2400 cents by 240 pumps. That's 2400 / 240 = 10 cents per pump.

"So, Joe's got $50 to buy some clothes. There's a sale goin' on at the store, 30% off. He picks out a shirt for $25 and some shorts for $35. I gotta figure out how much he's got left after buyin'.

First, I gotta find out how much he saves on the shirt. 30% of $25 is... um... 30% is like, a third, right? So, that's $25 divided by 3, which is $8.33. So, he saves $8.33 on the shirt.

Now, I gotta find the price of the shirt after the discount. That's $25 minus $8.33, which is $16.67.

Now, I add the price of the shirt and the shorts together. That's $16.67 + $35, which is $51.67.

Joe's got $50, and he spent $51.67. That means he's short $1.67."
"So Juan wants to make croissants, right? He wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week. That's a lotta croissants. There's 7 days in a week, so he's gonna make 4 dozen * 7 days. That's 28 dozen. Now, I know there's 12 croissants in a dozen, so that's 28 * 12, which is 336 croissants.

Now, it takes a quarter pound of butter to make a dozen croissants. So, we gotta multiply 336 by a quarter. That's like 336 * 0.25. I think that's like 84. Yeah, that's right. He needs 84 pounds of butter.

The final answer is: 84"
"So, Lewis' street is 490 meters long and it costs 194 bucks to repave a meter. I gotta multiply the two numbers together to find out how much it costs to repave Lewis' street.

Now, I gotta find out how much it costs to repave Monica's street. Her street is 150 meters long. I multiply that by 194.

194 * 150 = 29,100

Now, I gotta find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's. I subtract the cost of Monica's street from Lewis'.

95,060 - 29,100 = 65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"So, John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months. Then it takes him 10 times as long, so that's 50 months. Now, he needs more money each month. He needs 50% more than the first month, which is $100,000. 50% of $100,000 is $50,000, so he needs $150,000 each month for 50 months.

To find out how much he needs for 50 months, I multiply $150,000 by 50. That's $7,500,000.

Now, I add the first 5 months to the 50 months. $100,000 + $7,500,000 = $7,600,000.

"So, you wanna know the total price of three jewels. Alright, let's figure it out. 

First, we got a diamond jewel that's worth $2000. Now, the gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the diamond jewel. That means we gotta multiply 2000 by 4 and then divide by 5 to get the price of the gold jewel.

4/5 of 2000 is 1600. So, the gold jewel is worth $1600.

Now, the silver jewel is $400 less than the gold jewel. That means we gotta subtract 400 from 1600 to get the price of the silver jewel.

1600 - 400 is 1200. So, the silver jewel is worth $1200.

Now, we got all three prices. We just add 'em up to get the total price.

$2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800.

"So, Manny's parents said they won't sign him up for karate if the classes cost more than $10 per class. He's gotta pay $60 total for 10 classes. 

Let's see, if he pays $6 per class, that's 10 classes times $6, which is $60. But that's the same as if he paid $10 per class. So, if he pays $6 per class, he can take all 10 classes. 

But if he pays $10 per class, that's 10 classes times $10, which is $100. That's more than $60, so he can't take all 10 classes at $10 per class.

So, if he pays $6 per class, he can take all 10 classes. If he pays $10 per class, he can take 6 classes. That's because 6 times $10 is $60, which is the same as the total cost.

So, the answer is 6."
"So, Jewel, she's workin' at the cash register, and she does 50 customers a day. Now, Julie, she's faster, she does twice as many as Jewel. That means Julie does 50 * 2, which is 100 customers a day.

Now, we gotta figure out how many customers they do in a week. There's 7 days in a week, so Jewel does 50 * 7, which is 350 customers. And Julie does 100 * 7, which is 700 customers.

So, if we add 'em together, we get 350 + 700, which is 1050 customers.

He's also gettin' leather seats, and they cost one-third of the king cab, so that's $2,500. Then there's the runnin' boards, they're $500 cheaper than the leather seats, so that's $2,000. And he's gettin' some fancy lights, that's $1,500.

So, let's add it all up. $30,000 + $7,500 = $37,500. Then add the leather seats, $37,500 + $2,500 = $40,000. Then add the runnin' boards, $40,000 + $2,000 = $42,000. And finally, add the fancy lights, $42,000 + $1,500 = $43,500.

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"So, Tim gets a promotion. He's gettin' a 5% raise on his $20,000 a month. That's like, a little extra cash. And he's also gettin' a bonus, which is half of his monthly salary. That's a lot of money.

First, let's figure out the raise. 5% of $20,000 is like, a fifth of a fifth of $20,000. That's $1,000. So now he's makin' $20,000 + $1,000, which is $21,000 a month.

Now, let's figure out the bonus. Half of $20,000 is $10,000. That's a lot of cash.

So, now we gotta add the bonus to his new salary. That's $21,000 + $10,000, which is $31,000 a month.

Now, we gotta figure out how much he makes in a year. There's 12 months in a year, so we multiply $31,000 by 12. That's $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"So James buys a bunch of stuff. He gets 10 suits, 10 pants, and 3 shirts for each suit. 

First, let's figure out how much the suits cost. There's 10 suits and each one is $750. That's 10 * 750 = 7500 dollars.

Now, the pants. They cost 1/5 of what the suits cost. So, 1/5 of 750 is 150. There's 10 pants, so that's 10 * 150 = 1500 dollars.

Now, the shirts. There's 3 shirts for each suit, and there's 10 suits. That's 3 * 10 = 30 shirts. Each shirt is 60 dollars, so that's 30 * 60 = 1800 dollars.

Now, let's add it all up. 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 dollars.

The final answer is: $10800"
"So, there's this news website and its sister company. They publish a lot of articles. The news website puts out 20 articles every day, and its sister company puts out 10 articles every day. We gotta figure out how many articles they put out in February. February's got 28 days, right?

So, if the news website puts out 20 articles a day, that's 20 * 28 = 560 articles. And the sister company puts out 10 articles a day, that's 10 * 28 = 280 articles. Now, we gotta add 'em together. 560 + 280 = 840.

The final answer is: 840"
"So, Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she's 64. Their son is half as old as his mom, so he's 32. Now, his wife, she's 3 years younger than him, so she's... 32 - 3 = 29.

The final answer is: 29"
"So, you wanna know how much flour was in three bags before it was divided into portions. Alright, let's figure it out. 

If you got 8 portions in a bag and each portion is 2 kilograms, that means one bag has 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms of flour. 

Now, if you got three bags, you gotta multiply the amount in one bag by 3. So, 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is: 48"
"So, Alisa, she biked 12 miles an hour for 4.5 hours. That's 12 * 4.5, which is 54 miles. Then there's Stanley, he biked 10 miles an hour for 2.5 hours. That's 10 * 2.5, which is 25 miles. Now, if we add those two together, we get 54 + 25, which is... 79 miles.

The final answer is: 79"
"So, Bill's tryin' to dig a well in his yard. He can dig through soil pretty fast, 4 feet an hour. But clay's a lot harder, so it takes him twice as long, that's 2 feet an hour.

He's gotta dig through 24 feet of soil, so that's 24 / 4 = 6 hours. Then he's gotta dig through 8 feet of clay, that's 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

So, in total, it's gonna take him 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

The final answer is: 10"
"So Howie wants to get cupcakes for his whole class. He's thinkin' 'bout gettin' one vanilla and one chocolate for each person. He's gonna get some for himself, his teacher, and all his classmates. There's 25 kids in his class, plus him and his teacher, that's 27 people. He's gettin' 2 cupcakes for each person, so he needs to multiply 27 by 2.

27 * 2 = 54

So, Howie needs to get 54 cupcakes."
"So, Fishio posts a selfie on Instagram and gets 2000 likes. Then, after 3 weeks, she gets a whole lot more likes. It's 70 times more than the first 2000 likes. That's a lot, 70 times 2000 is 140000. 

Now, we gotta add the new likes she got. We don't know how many she got in those 3 weeks, but we do know she got 20000 more likes recently. So, if we subtract the first 2000 likes from 140000, we get 138000. That's how many likes she got in 3 weeks. 

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to 138000. That's 138000 + 20000 = 158000."
"So, Clara buys 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she gets $2 off 'cause she's got a voucher. That's 20 * 20, which is 400, minus 2, which is 398.

Then the next day, the price goes up to 30 bucks a pomegranate, and they give a 10% discount. So, 20 * 30 is 600, and 10% of 600 is 60, so that's 540.

Now, I gotta find the difference between the two prices. So, 540 minus 398 is 142.

The final answer is: $142"
"So, Ariadne's shop sells hats, and she made some money from red hats and green hats. In one month, she made $400 from red hats, and that's half of what she made from green hats. That means she made $800 from green hats. 

So, in that month, she made $800 + $400 = $1200.

Now, in the next month, she made 3/4 of what she made in the first month. That's 3/4 of $1200, which is $900.

So, in two months, she made $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"So James rents a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM. He gets one hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours. The first hour costs 15 bucks. Then each hour after that costs twice as much, so that's 30 bucks. 

So, he pays 15 for the first hour, 30 for the second hour, and 30 for the third hour. That's 15 + 30 + 30 = 75 bucks.

The final answer is: $75"
"So Sally's bank account had $200 in it at the start of the week. Now it's got $420. She didn't get any other money, just her wage. She's supposed to get $300 a week. 

Let's figure out how much she should have. If she's supposed to get $300 and she already had $200, she should have $300 + $200 = $500.

But she only has $420. So, she's missing $500 - $420 = $80. That's how much they took out of her wage."
"So, Lori's havin' a party and she's makin' deviled eggs. She needs 1 whole egg to make 2 halves, and each of her 16 guests is gonna eat 3 halves. 

First, we gotta figure out how many halves she needs in total. That's 16 guests times 3 halves per guest. That's 16 * 3 = 48 halves.

Now, we gotta figure out how many eggs she needs. She needs 1 egg for every 2 halves, so we gotta divide 48 by 2. That's 48 / 2 = 24 eggs.

Now, we gotta figure out how many dozens of eggs she needs. There's 12 eggs in a dozen, so we gotta divide 24 by 12. That's 24 / 12 = 2.

So, Lori needs 2 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 2"
"Shiela gotta write a 15-page paper. She done 1/3 of it. I wanna know how many pages she got left.

If she done 1/3, that means she got 1/3 done. So, she got 2/3 left. To find out how many pages that is, I'll just multiply 2/3 by 15.

2/3 * 15 = 10

So, Shiela got 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is: 10"
"So Mike's got a book to read, 200 pages, and he gotta read it in 30 days. He's gonna read 10 pages a day. 

Let's see, if he reads 10 pages a day, how many days will it take him to finish? 

200 pages divided by 10 pages a day is... 20 days. That's how long it'll take him to finish the book.

Now, if he's got 30 days to do it, and it'll take him 20 days, that means... he'll finish 10 days before the deadline.

The final answer is: 10"
"So, James buys a plane for $150,000. Then he pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger. That's a lot of money. He also spends twice as much as that on fuel, so that's $10,000 a month. 

To find out how much he spent in a year, we gotta multiply the monthly costs by 12. So, the hanger rental is $5000 * 12 = $60,000. And the fuel is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we gotta add all the costs together. The plane cost $150,000, the hanger rental is $60,000, and the fuel is $120,000. So, $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"So, Finley went to the store and bought rice, beans, and pork. It took her 30 minutes to cook the rice. Now, it took her 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice. That means it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook the pork.

Now, the beans took half the time it took to cook the pork and rice together. The pork and rice took 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes. So, it took her 40 minutes to cook the beans.

Now, let's add up the time it took to cook all the food: 
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

"So, you wanna know how much more it costs for a mix of almonds and walnuts. Alright, let's figure it out.

First, we gotta know how much a pound of almonds costs, which is $10, and a pound of walnuts costs $15. Now, we got two mixes. One's got 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, and the other's got 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

For the first mix, we gotta find out how much it costs. 1/2 pound of almonds is $5, and 1/3 pound of walnuts is $5. So, the total cost of the first mix is $5 + $5 = $10.

Now, for the second mix, 1/5 pound of almonds is $2, and 1/3 pound of walnuts is $5. So, the total cost of the second mix is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we gotta find out how much more the first mix costs than the second mix. That's $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"Let's figure this out. We got sheep and geese, and they got legs and heads. Sheep got 4 legs and geese got 2 legs. We know there's 70 legs in total. 

Let's say we got S sheep. Then we got 70 - 4S legs from the geese. But we know that's 2 times the number of geese, so we can say 70 - 4S = 2G. 

Now, we know there's 20 heads in total. Sheep got 1 head and geese got 1 head, so S + G = 20.

Let's simplify that. 70 - 4S = 40 - 2S. Now we move the S around: 70 - 40 = 2S - 4S. That's 30 = -2S. 

Now we divide by -2: S = -15. That still don't work. 

Let's try again. We know S + G = 20. We can say G is 20 - S. Now we plug that into the other equation: 70 - 4S = 2(20 - S). 

Let's simplify that. 70 - 4S = 40 - 2S. Now we move the S around: 70 - 40 = 2S - 4S. That's 30 = -2S. 

Now we divide by -2: S"
"So, Roger goes to the store to buy some coffee. He likes the regular kind, but it's sold out. He gets the more expensive kind instead. That costs 20% more than the regular kind. The regular kind is $5 a pound. 20% of 5 is 1, so the more expensive kind is $6 a pound.

He needs a week's worth of coffee, and he uses a pound a day. So, he needs 7 pounds. That's 7 * 6, which is 42 dollars for the coffee.

He also gets a donut for 2 dollars.

So, the total is 42 + 2, which is 44 dollars.

The final answer is: $44"
"So Gus went to the store and spent 20 bucks. He bought 2 bags of chips for 2 bucks each, that's 4 bucks. Then he got a bucket of fried chicken for 8 bucks and a soda for 1 buck. So that's 4 + 8 + 1 = 13 bucks. 

Now, if Gus spent 20 bucks and he spent 13 bucks on them other things, then the apple pie musta cost 20 - 13 = 7 bucks."
"So, James delivers newspapers, right? He gives 600 newspapers in a day. He gives 198 to one place, let's call it A, and 209 to another place, let's call it C. Now, we gotta figure out how many he gives to the other place, B.

We know he gives 198 to A and 209 to C. So, if we add those together, we get 407. Now, we gotta subtract that from the total number of newspapers he gives, which is 600.

600 - 407 = 193

So, James gives 193 newspapers to place B."
"So John's takin' a cookin' class, right? It's 4 times a week, and each time it's 2 hours. That's 4 * 2 = 8 hours a week. Now, it's 6 weeks, so that's 8 * 6 = 48 hours total.

Now, he learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. So, we gotta divide 48 by 1.5. That's like, 48 goes into 1.5... um... 32 times. Yeah, 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"So, there's 150 teachers on the court, and 60% of 'em are history teachers. That means 60% is 60 out of 100, so we gotta find 60% of 150. That's like, 60 out of 100 times 150. That's 90 history teachers.

Now, if there's 150 teachers and 90 of 'em are history teachers, that means the rest are math teachers. So, 150 minus 90 is 60. That's how many math teachers there are.

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, and we got 60 math teachers. So, we multiply 60 by 6. That's 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"So, let's figure this out. Aurelia got 120 bucks. Kassidy got 3/4 of that, which is like, 3 parts out of 4. That's 90 bucks. Then Rayna got 60 more than Kassidy, so that's 150 bucks.

Now, we gotta add all their money together. That's 120 + 90 + 150. That's 360 bucks. Now, we gotta split it three ways. That's 360 divided by 3. That's 120 bucks.

The final answer is: $120"
"So, Sarah's basketball game is 4 parts, and each part is 12 minutes long. That's 4 * 12, which is 48 minutes. But then they had to play some more 'cause it was tied. They played for 5 more minutes. So, you gotta add those 5 minutes to the 48 minutes. That makes 48 + 5, which is... 53 minutes.

The final answer is: 53"
"So, there's 50 people in the company, and 20% of 'em are in charge. That's like, 1 out of 5. So, 20% of 50 is... um... 10 people in charge.

Now, out of those 10 people, only 30% are in charge of the whole company. That's like, 3 out of 10. So, 30% of 10 is... 3 people.

So, 3 people oversee the whole company.

The final answer is: 3"
"So, Svetlana needs flour, sugar, and salt to make muffins. She needs 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and a quarter of a tablespoon of salt for each muffin. 

If she's makin' 16 muffins, we gotta multiply the amount of each ingredient by 16. So, for flour, that's 5 * 16 = 80 tablespoons. For sugar, that's 3 * 16 = 48 tablespoons. And for salt, that's 0.25 * 16 = 4 tablespoons.

Now, we gotta add 'em all up. 80 + 48 + 4 = 132. So, Svetlana needs 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

The final answer is: 132"
"So, Robert got 3 pounds of candy, Cindy got 5 pounds, and Aaron got 4 pounds. They wanna share it all together. First, we gotta add up all the candy they got. 

3 + 5 + 4 = 12

Now, we gotta divide it by how many people there is. There's 3 of 'em. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, each of 'em would get 4 pounds of candy."
"So Adam went to the store and bought some sweets. He got 7 of one kind and 10 of another. One of the first kind costs 50 cents, and one of the second kind costs 75 cents. He paid the cashier 15 bucks. I gotta figure out how much change he got.

First, I gotta find out how much he paid for the sweets. He got 7 of the first kind, and that's 50 cents each, so that's 7 x 50 cents = 350 cents. Then he got 10 of the second kind, and that's 75 cents each, so that's 10 x 75 cents = 750 cents. Now I add those two together: 350 cents + 750 cents = 1100 cents.

Now I gotta convert that to dollars. There's 100 cents in a dollar, so 1100 cents is 11 dollars. So Adam paid 11 dollars for the sweets.

Now I gotta find out how much change he got. He paid 15 bucks, and he owed 11 bucks, so the change is 15 - 11 = 4 bucks.

The final answer is: $4"
"So Christina's keepin' track of her moods on a calendar, right? She's got 30 days of moods. Outta those 30 days, 12 were good, 8 were bad, and the rest were neutral. Now, the first 8 days were good, then 8 days were bad, and then 8 days were neutral. After that, she's got 3 more days, and they're good, neutral, and good.

So, we know she's got 12 good days in total. We know the first 8 days were good, and then 3 more days were good. That's 8 + 2 = 10 good days. Now, we gotta figure out how many good days she's got left. If she's got 12 good days in total and she's already had 10, that means she's got 12 - 10 = 2 good days left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"So, Janey's got 21 books. It's said she's got more than Sally, but not just a little more. It's like, twice as many plus 3. That's how many books Janey's got. 

Let's figure out how many Sally's got. If Janey's got twice as many as Sally, plus 3, that's like... 2 times Sally's books, plus 3. So, if we take away 3 from Janey's books, that's like taking away the extra 3, and we're left with twice Sally's books. 

So, if we take 21 (Janey's books) and subtract 3, we get 18. That's twice Sally's books. Now, we gotta find out how many books Sally's got. We gotta divide 18 by 2. 

18 divided by 2 is... 9. So, Sally's got 9 books."
"So, Mrs. Jameson's bamboo is growin' like crazy, 30 inches a day. It's already 20 feet tall, and we wanna know how long it'll take to get to 600 inches. First, we gotta figure out how many inches 20 feet is. There's 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we gotta find out how much more it needs to grow. We subtract the current height from the target height:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we know it grows 30 inches a day, so we divide the difference by that:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it'll take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

The final answer is: 12"
"So James got some toys for the doggies. He had 4 toys for 4 dogs, but then there was more dogs. He had to get more toys. Then he went back and there was even more dogs. He had to get more toys again. Then he went back and some dogs was gone. He don't need those toys no more.

So, let's count the dogs. He had 4 dogs first. Then he got 8 more. That's 12 dogs. Then he got 16 more dogs. That's 28 dogs. Then 3 dogs was gone. That's 25 dogs.

He needs one toy for each dog. So he needs 25 toys."
"So, three people put in $1200 together. Dylan put in 2/5 of that, which is 480 bucks. That leaves 720. Then Frances put in 2/3 of 720, which is 480. That leaves 240. So, Skyler musta put in 240.

The final answer is: $240"
"So, Carol and Jennifer got a bunch of autographs from celebrities. Carol got 20, and Jennifer got 44. They wanna get 100 by the end of summer. They got 64 already, so they need more. 

They need 100 - 64 = 36 more signatures. They got three weeks left. So, they need to get 36 signatures in three weeks. 

To find out how many they need each week, I'll divide 36 by 3. That's 12. They need 12 signatures each week."
"So, Lorie earns 10 bucks an hour. Karen earns twice as much as Lorie, so she earns 20 bucks an hour. Now, if she works 3 hours a day, that's 3 * 20 = 60 bucks a day. And if she works for 2 days, that's 60 * 2 = 120 bucks.

The final answer is: $120"
"So, you wanna know how many hash browns I can make with 96 potatoes. I know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. That's like, a lot of hash browns from just 6 potatoes. 

If I got 96 potatoes, I can just multiply the number of hash browns I get from 6 potatoes by 16. That's 'cause 96 is 16 times 6. So, I multiply 36 hash browns by 16.

36 * 16 = 576

So, I can make 576 hash browns with 96 potatoes.

The final answer is: 576"
"So, you wanna know how much weight is too much for the elevator, right? Alright, let's figure it out. 

There's 9 people goin' up, and each person weighs about 80 kg. That's like, a big person, right? So, we gotta multiply 80 by 9 to get the total weight.

80 * 9 = 720 kg

Now, the elevator can only hold 700 kg. So, we gotta subtract 700 from 720 to see how much extra weight is on the elevator.

720 - 700 = 20 kg

So, they're 20 kg over the limit."
"So, let's figure this out. Katarina got 68 cookies. That's what we know. Now, we gotta find out how many the other people got.

Max got 5 more cookies than Katarina. So, Max got 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Now, the Cookie Monster, he got 12 less cookies than Max. That means he got 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

And then there's Summer. She got 23 more cookies than Max. That's 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we gotta add 'em all up. 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

The final answer is: 298"
"So, Shania's dress is 140cm long now. She added 20cm to it. That's like, extra stuff. To find out how long it was before, we gotta take away the extra stuff. 

First, we gotta figure out how much extra stuff is just the extra length, not the 20cm. Let's call the original length 'x'. If she added 50% of 'x', that's like half of 'x'. So, we gotta add that half to the 20cm. That's 0.5x + 20.

Now, we know the whole thing is 140cm, so we gotta set it up like this: x + (0.5x + 20) = 140.

We gotta get rid of the 20, so we subtract it: x + 0.5x = 120.

Now we gotta get rid of the 0.5x, so we multiply both sides by 2: 2x = 240.

Now we gotta get 'x' by itself, so we divide both sides by 2: x = 120.

So, the original dress was 120cm long.

The final answer is: 120"
"So, Chris has a lawn mower that's got two speeds. He can mow the whole lawn in an hour if he goes slow, or 40 minutes if he goes fast. Today, he decided to mow half the lawn slow and half fast. 

First, let's figure out how long it takes him to mow the lawn slow. An hour is 60 minutes, so if he mows half the lawn slow, that's 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes. Now, let's figure out how long it takes him to mow the lawn fast. 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes. 

Now, we gotta add those two times together to get the total time. 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"So they got 30 minutes to get to school. They gotta walk to the library first, that takes 6 minutes. Then they gotta walk to the fire station, that takes 13 minutes. I'm gonna add those two times together.

6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Now, I gotta subtract that from 30 minutes to see how much time they got left.

30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So they got 11 minutes left to get to school."
"So Catherine goes to the store and buys some stuff. She gets 1 kilo of apples for 4 bucks, 2 kilos of bananas for 2 bucks a kilo, and 2 kilos of oranges for 3 bucks a kilo. 

First, she gets the apples for 4 bucks. Then she gets the bananas, that's 2 kilos, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 bucks. And then she gets the oranges, 2 kilos, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 bucks.

Now, let's add it all up: 4 + 4 + 6 = 14 bucks.

The final answer is: $14"
"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, so she bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

So, they got 30 + 60 = 90 cookies in total. Then they ate 10 cookies. 

To find out how many cookies are left, we gotta subtract the cookies they ate from the total. 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's figure this out. We got one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. They all together is 44 years old. 

Let's say the younger twin is x. Then the older twin is x+7, and the triplet is x. 

We got three of 'em, so we add 'em up: x + (x+7) + x = 44

Now we gotta get rid of them parentheses. We do that by addin' the x's: 3x + 7 = 44

Now we gotta get rid of the 7. We do that by subtractin' 7 from both sides: 3x = 37

Now we gotta find out what x is. We do that by dividin' both sides by 3: x = 12.33

Now we know the younger twin is 12.33. But we need to find the older twin. We do that by addin' 7 to x: 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"
"So John's gotta do his homework first, right? He's got 20 minutes of math, 40 minutes of reading, and 20 minutes of history. That's a lot of homework. 

Let's add it up: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes. That's how long he's gotta do his homework.

Now, he's got 3 hours before dinner. We gotta turn that into minutes, 'cause that's how we measure time when we're doin' stuff. 3 hours is 3 x 60, that's 180 minutes.

Now, we gotta subtract the homework time from the dinner time: 180 - 80 = 100 minutes.

So John's got 100 minutes to nap."
"So, Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. I wanna know how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost.

First, I need to know how much one candy costs. If 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20, and 5 lollipops cost $2.00, then the 4 candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

Now, I divide $1.20 by 4 to find out how much one candy costs. $1.20 / 4 = $0.30. So, one candy costs $0.30.

Now, I need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost. 10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. And 10 candies cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"So, Rong saves 20 coins every month. That's like, a lot of coins. And Neil, he saves 2/5 more than Rong. To find out how much more, I gotta multiply 2/5 by 20. That's 8. So, Neil saves 20 + 8, which is 28 coins every month.

Now, let's see how many coins they save in a year. Rong saves 20 coins a month, so in a year, he saves 20 * 12, which is 240 coins. And Neil saves 28 coins a month, so in a year, he saves 28 * 12, which is 336 coins.

Now, let's see how many coins they save in 10 years. Rong saves 240 coins a year, so in 10 years, he saves 240 * 10, which is 2400 coins. And Neil saves 336 coins a year, so in 10 years, he saves 336 * 10, which is 3360 coins.

So, if we add Rong's and Neil's coins together, we get 2400 + 3360, which is... 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"So John goes to the vet with his dog. His dog needs 2 shots, which cost 20 bucks each, and a heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of the whole bill. John had 125 bucks with him.

First, we gotta find out how much the shots cost. 2 shots at 20 bucks each is 2 x 20 = 40 bucks.

Now, the heartworm check is 60% of the whole bill. Let's call the whole bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 60% of x, or 0.6x.

The whole bill is the shots plus the heartworm check, so it's 40 + 0.6x. We can set this equal to x: x = 40 + 0.6x.

Now, we gotta get x by itself. We can do that by subtracting 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = 40.

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4: x = 100.

So the whole bill is 100 bucks. The heartworm check is 60% of 100, which is 60 bucks.

John paid 40 bucks for the shots and 60 bucks for the heartworm check, so he paid 100 bucks total.

John had 125 bucks when he went in, so he leaves with 125 - 100 = 25 bucks.

The final answer is: $25"
"So, you wanna know how much a crate of fruit costs. Alright, let me tell you. There's 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges in a crate. 

Bananas cost twice as much as apples, and apples cost 50 cents. So, bananas cost 2 * 50 cents = 1 dollar.

Oranges cost three times as much as bananas, and we just found out bananas cost a dollar. So, oranges cost 3 * 1 dollar = 3 dollars.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the fruits:
- 5 bananas: 5 * 1 dollar = 5 dollars
- 12 apples: 12 * 50 cents = 6 dollars
- 7 oranges: 7 * 3 dollars = 21 dollars

So, the total cost of the crate is 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 dollars.

The final answer is: $32"
"So, Brittany's got a quilt with lots of little squares on it. They're all 1 foot by 1 foot. There's 14 red ones, then there's 4 more blue ones than red ones, so that's 18 blue ones. Then there's 6 more green ones than blue ones, so that's 24 green ones. And then there's 12 fewer white ones than green ones, so that's 12 white ones.

Let's count 'em all up: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68. So, Brittany's quilt is 68 square feet."
"So, there's gonna be 42 big people and 15 little ones goin' to Mia's restaurant. They need chairs for 'em. Now, they got 8 high chairs, and they got 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. That means they got 5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs.

Now, we gotta count how many chairs they need in total. We got 42 big people and 15 little ones, so that's 57 chairs they need. They already got 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs, so that's 48 chairs they already got.

Now, we gotta figure out how many more chairs they need. We do that by subtractin' the chairs they got from the chairs they need. So, 57 (chairs they need) - 48 (chairs they got) = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"So, there's 50 deer in a field. Now, 50 percent of 'em are bucks. That's like, half of 'em. So, we got 25 bucks.

Now, we gotta find out how many of them bucks are 8 points. It says 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. That's like, one-fifth of 'em. So, we gotta take 20 percent of 25. That's like, 0.2 times 25. That's... um... 5.

So, there's 5 deer that are 8 points."
"So, there's this class 3B, and they're tryin' to get enough points to go on a trip. There's Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam got 50 points. Now, Betty got more than Adam, 30% more. That's like, 15 more points. So, Betty got 65 points.

Tom got less than Betty, 30 points less. That's 35 points for Tom.

Martha got three times more than Tom, so that's 105 points for her.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points. They need 400 points to go on the trip. So, they're missin' 400 - 255 = 145 points.

The final answer is: 145"
"So Great Grandma Jones got 3 kids. And each of them got 3 kids of their own. That's 3 x 3 = 9 grandkids. Now, each of them got 3 babies, so that's 9 x 3 = 27. That's a lotta little ones.

The final answer is: 27"
"So, Greta gets a paycheck of $2400.00. She puts half of it in her retirement thingy, which is $1200.00. Then she uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment, which is $480.00. 

To find out how much she has left, I gotta subtract those two amounts from her paycheck. So, $2400.00 - $1200.00 is $1200.00, and then $1200.00 - $480.00 is $720.00.

So, she has $720.00 left to spend."
"So, there's a box that can hold 20 pencils. But there's 4 pencils missin'. How many pairs of pencils we got left?

First, we gotta figure out how many pencils we got left in the box. We do that by subtractin' the missin' pencils from the total. So, 20 minus 4 is 16.

Now, we gotta find out how many pairs we got. Since a pair is 2 pencils, we divide 16 by 2. That's 8."
"So, Hannah's city is doin' a big fireworks show for the 4th of July. They got 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box got 20 fireworks in it. That's a lotta fireworks. Hannah's house is in a good spot to see 40% of 'em. That's like, 40 out of 100. So, we gotta find 40% of 300 (15 boxes times 20 fireworks).

First, we gotta find 40% of 300. That's like, 0.4 times 300. That's 120. So, Hannah can see 120 fireworks from the city.

Now, Hannah's gonna set off some fireworks in her backyard too. She's got 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each. That's 15 fireworks. So, she's gonna see 120 from the city and 15 from her backyard.

Let's add 'em together. 120 + 15 is 135.

"So, Aiden and his friends are goin' to the movies. They got 19 people in total, 'cause Aiden and 12 of his friends, and then they meet up with 7 more friends. Each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. They buy enough drinks and snacks for all the seats.

So, they got 19 people, and each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks. That's 19 * 2 drinks, which is 38 drinks, and 19 * 3 snacks, which is 57 snacks. That's a total of 38 + 57, which is 95 items.

Now, each drink and snack costs 2 bucks. So, they spent 95 items * 2 dollars, which is 190 dollars.

The final answer is: $190"
"So, let's figure this out. We got three truck drivers, Gissela, Gordy, and Gary. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so that's 4,800 pounds. Now, when Gary joins 'em, all three trucks together can haul 11,600 pounds.

Let's see, if we add Gissela's and Gordy's trucks together, that's 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. Now, we gotta find out how much Gary's truck can haul. We do that by subtractin' 8,800 from 11,600.

11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800

So, Gary's truck can haul 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"So, Larry made dumplings for his friends. There's 8 guys and 6 girls. Each guy ate one more dumpling than each girl. Girls ate 3 dumplings each. I'm tryin' to figure out how many dumplings Larry made.

First, I count how many people there is. That's 8 guys plus 6 girls, so that's 14 people.

Now, I think about how many dumplings the girls ate. There's 6 girls and each ate 3 dumplings, so that's 6 times 3, which is 18 dumplings.

Next, I think about the guys. Each guy ate one more dumpling than each girl, so each guy ate 4 dumplings. There's 8 guys, so that's 8 times 4, which is 32 dumplings.

Now, I add up how many dumplings the girls and guys ate. That's 18 dumplings from the girls plus 32 dumplings from the guys, which is 50 dumplings.

So, Larry made 50 dumplings.

The final answer is: 50"
"So, Gerald and Julia got $100 together. They split it in a certain way, 3 parts for Gerald and 2 parts for Julia. That's like, 5 parts in total. Gerald gets 3 parts, so he gets 3/5 of the money.

To find out how much Gerald got, I'll just multiply 3 by 100, and then divide by 5. That's like, 3 x 100 = 300, and then 300 divided by 5 is 60. So Gerald got 60 bucks.

Now, Gerald spent 10 bucks on a book. To find out how much he has left, I'll just subtract 10 from 60. That's 60 - 10 = 50.

So, Gerald has 50 bucks left."
"So, Martha's cat is super fast, and her turtle is, like, really slow. The cat can run 15 feet in a second. I think I know how to figure this out. If the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, that means the turtle is, like, 1/5 as fast as the cat. 

So, if the cat can run 15 feet in a second, the turtle can run... um... 15 divided by 5. That's like, 3 feet in a second. Now, I gotta find out how far the turtle can go in 40 seconds. I think I know this one. You just multiply the speed by the time. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

So, the turtle can go 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"So, the firefighters wanna raise $6300. They already got $2100 in 3 hours. They wanna know how many more hours they gotta work to get the rest.

First, we gotta figure out how much they get per hour. They got $2100 in 3 hours, so we divide that by 3. That's $700 per hour.

Now, we gotta find out how much more they need. They need $6300 total, and they already got $2100. So, they need $6300 - $2100 = $2100 more.

Now, we divide the amount they need by the amount they get per hour. That's $2100 / $700 = 3 hours.

They already worked 3 hours, so we add the 3 hours they need to the 3 hours they already worked. That's 3 + 3 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"So, let's figure this out. Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Now, they use 80% of that 40% for industrial stuff. That's like, 80% of 40%, which is 32%. 

So, if they use 32% for industrial stuff, that means they use 100% - 32% = 68% for other stuff. But we want to know what percent of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, and that's 40% of the river. 

So, if they use 68% of 40% for non-industrial stuff, that's like 0.68 * 40% = 27.2%. But we want the percentage, not the decimal, so that's 27.2% or 27.2/100 * 100 = 27.2% is not the answer we want, we want the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, which is 27.2% of 40% of the river's total water. 

So, the answer is 27.2% of 40% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, which is 27.2% of 40% or 27.2/100 * 40/100 = 10.88% of the river's total water is not the

"So, Alex is gettin' paid to tutor people, right? And she does it for 2 whole weeks. Now, I know there's 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is... 7 * 2 = 14 days. 

Now, she gets paid 12 bucks a day. So, if she works for 14 days, that's... 14 * 12 = 168 dollars.

The final answer is: $168"
"So, the ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. That's like, 50 quarts per hour. And it makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours, so that's like, 12.5 quarts per hour.

If they work for 48 hours, they'll make 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream. And they'll make 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.

So, if you add those together, you get 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts of ice cream.

The final answer is: 3000"
"So Marcus buys some stuff. He gets 5 croissants for 3 bucks each, that's 5 * 3 = 15 dollars. Then he gets 4 cinnamon rolls for 2.50 each, that's 4 * 2.50 = 10 dollars. He also gets 3 mini quiches for 4 bucks each, that's 3 * 4 = 12 dollars. And he gets 13 blueberry muffins for a buck each, that's 13 * 1 = 13 dollars.

So now we add all that up, 15 + 10 + 12 + 13 = 50 dollars. Then he gets a discount, 10% off, that's like a tenth of 50, so that's 5 dollars off. So now we subtract that, 50 - 5 = 45 dollars.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"So Erin's got 6 bucks and she wants to buy ice cream. Each scoop is 1.50 bucks. She can get 4 scoops with that money, right? 

But then I thought about it, and if she buys 2 scoops, she gets 1 free. So she can get 3 scoops for 3 bucks. And then she's got 3 bucks left. She can use that to buy 2 more scoops. 

So, Erin should buy 5 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: 5"
"So, Ginger and Amy got 100 pieces of candy each. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We gotta figure out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

Two weeks is 14 days, right? So, Ginger eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces. That's a lot of candy. Amy eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces. That's less than Ginger.

Now, let's see how much candy they got left. Ginger had 100 and ate 56, so she got 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left. Amy had 100 and ate 42, so she got 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

Now, we gotta find out how much more candy Amy got than Ginger. That's 58 - 44 = 14. So, Amy got 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

The final answer is: 14"
"So Mr. Boarden's bathroom is 36 sq ft. He wants to cover two thirds of it. Two thirds of 36 is... um... let me think... if you take 2 and divide it by 3, that's like, 2 groups of 3, so that's 6. Then you multiply 6 by 6, that's 36. So two thirds of 36 is 36. 

Now, he needs 24 tiles for every square foot. So for 36 sq ft, he needs 24 * 36 = 864 tiles. But wait, he only wants to cover two thirds of it, so we gotta take 2/3 of 864. That's like, 2 groups of 864, divided by 3. So that's 1728 / 3 = 576.

The final answer is: 576"
"So James goes blueberry pickin', right? He gotta pay $20 to get in, then it's $1.5 a pound for the blueberries. He picks 30 pounds. 

First, you gotta figure out how much he paid for the blueberries. You gotta add the $20 to the $1.5 times 30. That's $20 + $45. That's $65.

Now, if he bought 'em at the store, it'd be $2.5 a pound. So, $2.5 times 30 is $75.

Now, you gotta figure out how much he saved. That's $75 minus $65. That's $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"So, the company wanted to buy 500 computers and they had 700 bucks for each one. But then they found out the price went up by 10%. I don't know what that means, but I think it means they had to pay more.

So, if they had to pay 10% more, that's like, 10 out of 100, or 1/10. That's like 70 bucks more for each computer. So now each computer costs 700 + 70 = 770 bucks.

Now, they gotta buy 500 computers, so we gotta multiply 770 by 500. That's like, 770 x 500 = 385,000 bucks.

The final answer is: $385,000"
"So, John makes a big ol' omelet with 6 eggs, 2 oz of cheese, and 2 oz of ham. I gotta figure out how many calories that is.

First, I know eggs are 75 calories each, so 6 eggs is... 6 x 75 = 450 calories.

Now, cheese is 120 calories per ounce, so 2 oz of cheese is 2 x 120 = 240 calories.

And ham is 40 calories per ounce, so 2 oz of ham is 2 x 40 = 80 calories.

Now, I add 'em all up: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The final answer is: 770"
"So you wanna know how much change you'd get if you buy 6 pencils and 8 erasers. Alright, let's figure it out. 

Pencils cost 50 cents each, and you buy 6 of 'em. That's 6 * 50 cents, which is 300 cents. Now, I don't know what that is in dollars, but I know it's a lot. 

Eraser's cost 25 cents each, and you buy 8 of 'em. That's 8 * 25 cents, which is 200 cents. Now, I think I know what that is in dollars... that's 2 dollars.

So, you spent 300 cents on pencils and 200 cents on erasers. That's 500 cents. I think that's 5 dollars. 

You paid 10 dollars, so you get 10 - 5 = 5 dollars back. That's your change."

"Goldy got 20 sacks of rice. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. I wanna know how much rice she gave to them.

First, I gotta find out how many sacks she gave away. I do that by addin' the sacks she gave to her cousin and brother. 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Now, I know each sack has 25 kilograms of rice. So, I multiply the sacks she gave away by the weight of each sack. 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

Now, let's figure out how many times she taps her feet in total. She dances for 5 minutes, but only 2 of those minutes are with her arms up. So, we gotta calculate the taps for both scenarios and add 'em together.

First, let's do the easy one: when her arms are down. She taps her right foot 300 times a minute and her left foot 250 times a minute. That's 550 taps per minute. Now, we multiply that by 3 minutes, 'cause that's how long she's got her arms down. That's 1650 taps.

Now, let's do the other one: when her arms are up. She taps each foot 200 times a minute. That's 400 taps per minute. Now, we multiply that by 2 minutes, 'cause that's how long she's got her arms up. That's 800 taps.

Now, we add 'em together: 1650 + 800 = 2450. So, Helga taps her feet a total of 2450 times."
"So, Ron's car is gonna get all messed up from this pothole and it's gonna cost him $450. But if he fixes it himself, the city's gonna fine him $120. And he gotta buy 3 buckets of that stuff, asphalt, and each one's $25. So, that's 3 * 25, which is 75. 

So, the total cost of fixin' it is 120 + 75, which is 195. Now, if he don't fix it, he's gonna lose 450. If he does fix it, he's gonna lose 195. So, he's savin' 450 - 195, which is 255.

The final answer is: $255"
"So, the restaurant got 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. Then, they sent 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs to get fixed. I gotta count how many chairs they got left.

They got 170 normal chairs and sent 20 away, so they got 170 - 20 = 150 normal chairs left. Then they got 23 baby chairs and sent 13 away, so they got 23 - 13 = 10 baby chairs left.

Now, I gotta add the normal chairs and baby chairs together to get the total. 150 + 10 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"So, let's figure this out. There's 5 people, and each person gets a pizza with 12 slices. Now, 3 of 'em ate 2/3 of their pizzas. That's 8 slices each. So, 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices. 

Now, there's 2 other people, and they ate ¾ of their pizzas. That's 9 slices each. So, 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

Now, we gotta add up all the slices they ate. 24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices. Now, we gotta find out how many slices are left. There's 5 people, and each person gets 12 slices. So, 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices. Now, we subtract the slices they ate from the total. 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"So, the cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Now, the dog eats the same number of sausages, but it takes him less time. It takes him 2/3 the time the cat takes. 

So, if the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes 2/3 of that. That's 20 minutes. 

Now, we gotta find the average time they both take. We add the times together and divide by 2. That's 30 + 20 = 50. Then we divide by 2, which is 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"So, Topher's got big shoes, right? And one of 'em is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Now, I gotta figure out how long Bobby's shoes are. 

First, I gotta turn 8 feet into inches. That's like, 8 times 12, 'cause there's 12 inches in a foot. That's 96 inches. Then I add 4 more inches, so that's 100 inches for Topher's shoe.

Now, I'm told that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call Bobby's shoe 'x'. So, I got the equation: x * 9 + 10 = 100.

I subtract 10 from both sides, so I get x * 9 = 90. Then I divide both sides by 9, and I get x = 10.

So, Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long.

The final answer is: 10"
"So, Hannah goes crazy and starts breakin' windows in the school parking lot. She breaks a quarter of the students' cars' windows and three quarters of the teachers' cars' windows. There's 64 students' cars with 4 windows each, and 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each.

First, let's figure out how many windows she breaks from the students' cars. There's 64 students' cars, and each one's got 4 windows. So, that's 64 * 4 = 256 windows. Now, she breaks a quarter of 'em, which is 1/4. That's like 1 out of 4, so we gotta divide 256 by 4. That's 256 / 4 = 64.

Now, let's do the teachers' cars. There's 32 teachers' cars, and each one's got 2 windows. So, that's 32 * 2 = 64 windows. Now, she breaks three quarters of 'em, which is 3/4. That's like 3 out of 4, so we gotta multiply 64 by 3 and then divide by 4. That's 64 * 3 = 192, and then 192 / 4 = 48.

Now, we gotta add 'em together. 64 + 48 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"So, Candy's got a bunch of threads. She's got 15 light blue ones, 45 dark blue ones, 40 light green ones, and 50 dark green ones. I wanna know what percent of 'em are blue.

First, I gotta count how many blue ones she's got. That's the light blue and the dark blue ones. So, I add 'em together: 15 + 45 = 60. That's how many blue ones she's got.

Now, I gotta count how many threads she's got in total. That's all the blue ones plus the green ones: 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150. That's all the threads.

Now, I gotta figure out what percent of 'em are blue. I take the number of blue ones, which is 60, and I divide it by the total number of threads, which is 150. Then I multiply by 100. That's how you get the percent.

60 / 150 = 0.4
0.4 * 100 = 40

So, 40% of Candy's threads are blue.

The final answer is: 40"
"So, like, there's 5000 people at the polling station at 8:00. By midday, 2/5 of 'em voted. That's 2000 people. 

Now, by 16:00, 2/3 of the people who didn't vote by midday voted. That's 3000 people left after midday, and 2/3 of 'em voted. So, 2/3 of 3000 is 2000. 

So, 2000 people voted by 16:00. That means 3000 people didn't vote by 16:00. 

The final answer is: 3000"
"So, Parker chews gum a lot. He chews 4 pieces a day. I reckon he's gonna chew a lot in 30 days. Let's see... 4 pieces a day, that's a lotta gum. If he chews 4 pieces a day for 30 days, that's... um... 4 x 30... that's 120 pieces of gum.

Now, I know he buys gum in packs. Each pack's got 15 pieces. So, to find out how many packs he needs, I gotta divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack. That's 120 divided by 15. Let me think... 120 divided by 15... that's... 8.

So, Parker needs 8 packs of gum."
"So, we gotta figure out how many boxes of graham crackers we need. There's 9 kids and they each want 2 smores, so that's 9 * 2 = 18 smores for the kids. Then there's 6 adults and they each want 1 s'more, so that's 6 * 1 = 6 smores for the adults. 

Now we gotta add 'em together, so 18 + 6 = 24 smores in total. Each box of graham crackers makes 8 smores, so we need 24 / 8 = 3 sleeves. Since there's 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 / 3 = 1 box.

So, we need 1 box of graham crackers.

The final answer is: 1"
"So, Dora's age is 15. Her dad's age is 8 more than twice hers. That's 2 x 15 + 8. That's 30 + 8. That's 38.

Her mom's age is 4 years less than her dad's. That's 38 - 4. That's 34.

Now, we gotta add 'em all up. 15 + 38 + 34. That's 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"So, Greg found 20 bucks on the street and he's got 3 little siblings. He wants to split it fair, so he gives each of 'em some.

20 divided by 3 is... um... 6 and some change."
"So, Cindy's got some books. Her math and science books, they weigh the same, 2 pounds each. Then she's got a French book that's 4 pounds, and an English book that's 3 pounds. Now, her history book, it's twice as heavy as her English book, so that's 6 pounds.

Let's add 'em up: 2 + 2 (for the math and science) is 4. Then we got 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 13. Wait, no, that's not right. I made a mistake. Let me do it again. 2 + 2 is 4, 4 + 4 is 8, 8 + 3 is 11, and 11 + 6 is 17.

Now, we gotta figure out how many votes candidate C got. We know A and B got 50 votes together. So, if we subtract that from the total number of votes, which is 100, we get the number of votes C got.

100 - 50 = 50

So, candidate C got 50 votes.

The final answer is: 50"
"So, Boris got 100 apples. And Beck, he got 23 less than Boris. That means Beck got 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Then, Boris gave Beck 10 apples. So, Beck now got 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Now, Boris got 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

So, Beck got 87 apples and Boris got 90 apples. To find out how many less apples Beck got than Boris, we gotta subtract Beck's apples from Boris's apples. That's 90 - 87 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"So, Peter's got 32 ounces of water. He's gonna make some big cubes, some medium cubes, and some small cubes. Big cubes use 4 ounces each, medium cubes use 2 ounces each, and small cubes use 1/2 an ounce each.

He's makin' 3 big cubes, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 ounces. Then he's makin' 7 medium cubes, so that's 7 * 2 = 14 ounces. And he's makin' 8 small cubes, so that's 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, let's add all that up: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces. That's how much water he used. Now, we gotta subtract that from the 32 ounces he started with. 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

The final answer is: 2"
"So Clara's got 20 books. And she's got twice as many as Steven. That means Steven's got 20 / 2, which is 10 books. Now, Alice's got 6 more books than Steven, so she's got 10 + 6, which is 16 books.

Now, I wanna know how many more books Clara's got than Alice. Clara's got 20 books and Alice's got 16 books. So Clara's got 20 - 16, which is 4 more books than Alice.

"So Cecelia went to the store and bought some milk. She got 10 big jars and 16 little jars. The big jars cost $5 each, and the little jars cost $3 each. 

I think I know how to do this. You gotta add up the cost of the big jars and the little jars. 

First, I'll add up the cost of the big jars. 10 big jars * $5 = $50. That's how much the big jars cost.

Now, I'll add up the cost of the little jars. 16 little jars * $3 = $48. That's how much the little jars cost.

Now, I'll add those two numbers together. $50 + $48 = $98.

The final answer is: $98"
"So, there's 50 kids in a class. Some like to bake, some like to play basketball, and some like to play video games or music. We know 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. Now, we're told that the ones who like music are twice as many as the ones who like basketball. That means if 5 like basketball, then 2 times 5 is 10, so 10 like music.

Now, we gotta figure out how many like video games. We know there's 50 kids total, and 10 like to bake and 5 like basketball. That's 15 kids. So, if we subtract 15 from 50, we get 35. That means 35 kids like video games or music. We already know 10 like music, so if we subtract 10 from 35, we get 25. That means 25 kids like video games.

"So, Jeremy saw 12 birds in his backyard. Then he threw a rock at 'em and scared away some. He scared away 1/3 of 'em. Now, I don't know what 1/3 is, but I know it's like, a quarter and a little bit more. So, I'm gonna guess it's like 4 birds.

So, if he scared away 4 birds, that means he's got 12 - 4 = 8 birds left.

Then, some more birds came. 20 more birds came. So, now he's got 8 + 20 = 28 birds.

So, there's 28 birds in the backyard now."
"So, there's two classes with 80 kids in total. I'm thinkin', if they're equal, that means each class has 40 kids. Now, I'm told 40% of 'em are girls. That's like, 4 out of 10, right? So, if I got 40 kids, I'd multiply 40 by 4, and that's 160, but that can't be right 'cause that's more than 40. I think I did it wrong. Let me try again. If 40% is 4 out of 10, that's like 4/10 of 40. I can do that. 4/10 of 40 is 16. So, there's 16 girls in each class. Now, if there's 40 kids in each class and 16 are girls, that means... um... 40 - 16 is... 24. So, there's 24 boys in each class.

The other park costs 14 bucks for adults and 10 bucks for kids. They got 2 adults and 2 kids. I'm gonna figure out how much they save if they go to the cheaper park.

First, I'm gonna add up the cost for the first park. For the adults, it's 2 times 26, that's 52 bucks. And for the kids, it's 2 times 12, that's 24 bucks. So, the total for the first park is 52 + 24, that's 76 bucks.

Now, let's do the same for the second park. For the adults, it's 2 times 14, that's 28 bucks. And for the kids, it's 2 times 10, that's 20 bucks. So, the total for the second park is 28 + 20, that's 48 bucks.

Now, I'm gonna subtract the cost of the second park from the first park. That's 76 - 48, that's 28 bucks.

First, we gotta figure out how many students per group. We got 54 students and we're makin' 6 groups, so we divide 54 by 6. That's 9 students per group.

Now, we need 12 groups, but we only got 6. So, we gotta make 6 more groups. We already know we need 9 students per group. 

So, we need 6 more groups, and each group needs 9 students. That's 6 * 9 = 54 more students we need."
"So, Candy rents chairs. She rents 60 chairs a day from Monday to Friday, and 100 chairs on the weekends. I wanna know how many chairs she'll rent in two months.

There's 4 weeks in a month, so in one month, there's 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. 

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekend days: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, I multiply the total chairs rented in a week by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month):
500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

But Arnold, he's a sneaky one, he took 12 more. So now Gunther's got 49 - 12, which is 37 bananas.

Then Gunther got 6 more bananas. Now he's got 37 + 6, which is 43 bananas.

So Gunther's got 43 bananas."
"So, Jenna's got 4 roommates, right? And the electricity bill is $100 a month. We gotta split that up between the 4 of 'em. 

$100 divided by 4 is $25. That's how much each one of 'em owes per month. Now, we gotta figure out how much that is for a whole year. There's 12 months in a year, so we multiply $25 by 12.

$25 * 12 = $300. That's how much each one of Jenna's roommates owes for electricity per year."
"So, Jeff sent out a bunch of glasses and plates for a party. He sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. Now, I don't know what a dozen is, but I think it's like a bunch of stuff. So, 8 dozen glasses is like 8 bunches of glasses, and 4 dozen plates is like 4 bunches of plates.

So, he sent out 8 bunches of glasses, and that's like... um... 8 * 12, that's like 96 glasses. And 4 bunches of plates is like... 4 * 12, that's like 48 plates.

Now, some of the stuff came back broken. 10 glasses were broken and 6 plates were broken. So, we gotta take those away from the bunches he sent out. 

Glasses left: 96 - 10 = 86
Plates left: 48 - 6 = 42

So, Jeff's got 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

"So Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for buttons. 90% of 30 is 27, so she trades 27 small stickers for buttons. That's 27 small buttons.

Now she's got 3 small stickers left. She trades 50% of her large stickers for buttons. 50% of 40 is 20, so she trades 20 large stickers for buttons. That's 20 large buttons.

She's got 20 large stickers left. She trades those for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now she's got 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers, 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons. Let's count 'em up. 3 + 20 + 27 + 20 = 70.

"So, there's this council and they voted on somethin'. They said more people voted for it than against it, and it's like, twice as many. There's 33 people on the council. I'm tryin' to figure out how many voted for it.

Let's say the people who voted against it is x. Then, the people who voted for it is 2x, 'cause it's twice as many. So, if we add 'em up, it's x + 2x, and that's equal to 33.

x + 2x = 33

That's like, the same as 3x = 33. Now, I gotta get x by itself. I do that by dividin' both sides by 3.

3x / 3 = 33 / 3
x = 11

So, x is 11. That means 11 people voted against it. And since 2x is the people who voted for it, I multiply 2 by 11.

2 * 11 = 22

So, 22 people voted for it."
"So, Krissa needs to get shirts for her preschool kids. She needs 11 shirts for the little ones. Then she needs 2 times as many for the small ones, so that's 22 shirts. Then she needs 4 less than the small ones for the medium ones, so that's 18 shirts. Then she needs half as many for the large ones as the medium ones, so that's 9 shirts. And then she needs 6 more than the large ones for the extra-large ones, so that's 15 shirts.

So, let's count 'em all up: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

Let's say the second house needs x cases of shingles. Then the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

We know that the total number of cases is 250, so we can say x + x/2 + x = 250. Multiplyin' by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we get 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Now we combine like terms: 5x = 500. 

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

So the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"
"So, Leila buys 3 cucumbers. They cost 2 bucks each. That's 3 * 2 = 6 dollars.

Then, Jack buys 5 tomatoes. They cost 1 buck each. That's 5 * 1 = 5 dollars.

And Chase buys 1 head of lettuce. It costs 3 bucks.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 6 + 5 + 3 = 14 dollars.

The final answer is: $14"
"So, George has 200 bananas. He's got 45% more pears than bananas. That means he's got 45% of 200 bananas in pears. 

45% of 200 is like, um, 45 out of 100, so it's 0.45 times 200. That's 90 pears. 

So, George's got 200 bananas and 90 pears. That's 290 fruits in total.

The final answer is: 290"
"Marissa had 80 bucks, and she spent 20 bucks on a ball. That means she had 80 - 20 = 60 bucks left. Now, she used that 60 bucks to buy candy bars for her brother Jimmy. Each candy bar costs 5 bucks. To find out how many candy bars she bought, we gotta divide 60 by 5.

60 / 5 = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy."
"So, Sam wants to make 4 liters of juice. He needs 5 kilograms of oranges for 1 liter. That's a lot of oranges. He needs 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges. 

Each kilogram costs 3 bucks. So, 20 kilograms will cost 20 * 3 = 60 bucks. That's how much Sam needs to spend."
"So, Ezra read 300 books in one hour. That's a lot of books. He read twice as many as Ahmed. So, Ahmed musta read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Ezra's gonna read 150 more books. That's 300 + 150 = 450 books for him.

Now, let's add up all the books they read. Ahmed read 150, and Ezra read 450. So, 150 + 450 = 600.

The final answer is: 600"
"So Tanya is teachin' at school, right? She gets paid $15 for every hour she teaches. And if she teaches more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5 a day. 

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. That's 5 hours times $15, which is $75. And she gets that extra $5, so she gets $80 for Monday.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. That's 2 hours times $15, which is $30. She don't get that extra $5, 'cause she only taught 2 classes. So she gets $30 for Wednesday.

Now, let's add 'em up. $80 for Monday and $30 for Wednesday, that's $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"So, the perfume company sold some scents. They got 4 kinds of vanilla and 8 kinds of fruity scents. They sold 5 of each kind of vanilla scent and 2 of each kind of fruity scent. I gotta figure out how many more vanilla scents they sold than fruity scents.

They sold 5 vanilla scents, and there's 4 kinds, so they sold 5 * 4 = 20 vanilla scents.

They sold 2 fruity scents, and there's 8 kinds, so they sold 2 * 8 = 16 fruity scents.

Now, I gotta find out how many more vanilla scents they sold than fruity scents. That's 20 - 16.

The final answer is: 4"
"So Bennet sells eggplants for 3 bucks each and he sells 20 of 'em. That's 20 * 3 = 60 bucks. He wants to make 135 bucks total. So he needs to make 135 - 60 = 75 bucks from the corn.

He's got 25 ears of corn. To figure out how much he should sell each ear for, I'll just divide 75 by 25. That's 75 / 25 = 3.

The final answer is: $3"
"So, Tatiana's got 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. She's gonna spend some of that time playin' soccer, some time playin' video games, and some time readin'. She's gonna read for 3 hours. That's 3 hours gone.

Now, she's gonna play video games for 1/3 of the time that's left. That's 1/3 of 9 hours, 'cause 12 minus 3 is 9. So, 1/3 of 9 is 3 hours. That's how much time she's gonna spend playin' video games.

Now, we gotta figure out how much time she's gonna spend playin' soccer. That's 12 hours total minus 3 hours for readin' and 3 hours for video games. That's 12 - 3 - 3, which is 6 hours.

Now, we gotta figure out what percentage of her weekend she's spendin' playin' soccer. That's 6 hours out of 12. So, we take 6 and divide it by 12, and then multiply by 100. That's 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"So, Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave half of 'em to Brandon. That's 25 pencils. Now he's left with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 3/5 of 25 is like, um, 3 groups of 5, that's 15 pencils. So, he gave 15 to Charlie.

Now, he's left with 25 - 15 = 10 pencils. That's how many pencils Anthony kept.

The final answer is: 10"
"So, Jack goes to the museum, right? It's 150 miles away from his house. He drives 75 miles per hour, so it takes him 2 hours to get there. Then he's gotta drive back, which is the same distance, so that's another 2 hours. That's 4 hours just driving. He spends 6 hours at the museum. So, how long is he gone? 

Let's add those hours together: 4 hours driving + 6 hours at the museum = 10 hours.

The final answer is: 10"
"So, Henry's got a bunch of toys to put together. He's got 57 cars and 73 motorcycles. Each car needs 4 wheels and each motorcycle needs 2 wheels. I gotta figure out how many wheels he's got left after he's done.

First, I gotta count the wheels for the cars. That's 57 cars times 4 wheels per car, which is... um... 228 wheels. Then I gotta count the wheels for the motorcycles. That's 73 motorcycles times 2 wheels per motorcycle, which is... 146 wheels. Now I add those two numbers together, 228 + 146, which is... 374 wheels.

Now, Henry's got a box with 650 wheels in it. I gotta subtract the number of wheels he used from the number of wheels he had. So, 650 - 374 is... 276 wheels.

The final answer is: 276"
"So you wanna know how much you gotta pay for a laptop that's $1000. If you get a 20% discount, that's like, a big chunk off. 

To find out how much you save, you gotta take 20% of 1000. That's like, 20 out of 100, so it's 0.20. Multiply that by 1000, and you get 200. That's how much you save.

Now, you gotta subtract that from the original price. So, 1000 minus 200 is 800. That's how much you gotta pay.

The final answer is: $800"
"So Mike's got 600 movies and he wants to get rid of 'em all. He's got 200 movies that's part of a series, and he can get those for cheaper, only $6 each. Then he's got some old movies, 40% of the rest, and those are $5 each. The rest are regular movies, which cost $10 each.

First, let's figure out how much the series movies cost. There's 200 of 'em, and they're $6 each, so that's 200 * 6 = 1200 dollars.

Now, we gotta find out how many of the rest of the movies are old. 40% of the rest, that's 40% of 400, so that's 160 movies. And they're $5 each, so that's 160 * 5 = 800 dollars.

Now we gotta find out how many of the rest are regular movies. There's 400 movies left, and 160 of 'em are old, so that's 240 regular movies. And they're $10 each, so that's 240 * 10 = 2400 dollars.

Now we add it all up: 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 dollars.

"So, Winston went to the orchard and picked some fruit. He got 6 pounds of peaches for $2.00 a pound, 8 pounds of plums for $1.00 a pound, and 6 pounds of apricots for $3.00 a pound. 

First, I gotta figure out how much he spent on peaches. That's 6 pounds times 2 dollars a pound, so that's 12 dollars. Then, he got 8 pounds of plums for 1 dollar a pound, so that's 8 dollars. And last, he got 6 pounds of apricots for 3 dollars a pound, so that's 18 dollars.

Now, I gotta add all that up. 12 dollars plus 8 dollars is 20 dollars. Then I add 18 dollars to that, so that's 38 dollars.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"So, the Llesis family drove and hiked to their vacation spot. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. That's 50 times 6, which is 300 miles. 

They also hiked for 1.5 hours. Now, I gotta figure out how fast they hiked. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 less than that is 20. So they hiked at 20 miles per hour.

Now, I multiply 20 by 1.5 to find out how far they hiked. That's 20 times 1.5, which is 30 miles.

Now, I add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked. 300 plus 30 is 330.

The final answer is: 330"
"So, Ava and Emma are playin' this new video game, and they wanna see who's better. They each play one level, and whoever gets the most points wins. They get points for jumpin' on enemies, collectin' berries, and finishin' the level before time runs out.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, and she gets 3 more berries. But she finishes the level 4 seconds slower. I gotta figure out how much more points Ava gets than Emma.

Let's say Emma gets x points. Ava gets x + 8 points for jumpin' on 8 more enemies. She also gets x + 3 points for gettin' 3 more berries. But she finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she gets 56 - x points for the timer.

So, Emma gets x points, and Ava gets x + 8 + x + 3 + 56 - x = 67 + x points.

The difference between their scores is 67 + x - x = 67.

But wait, we don't know what x is. We gotta figure out the difference in another way. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies, so that's 8 more points. She gets 3 more berries, so that's 3 more points. But she finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so that's 4 less points.

So, the difference between their scores is 8 + 3 - 4 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"So, four friends got four pizzas and they paid 64 dollars for 'em. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. I wanna know how much the other two pizzas cost.

First, I gotta find out how much the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each cost in total. That's easy, it's just 30 * 2 = 60 dollars.

Now, I gotta find out how much the other two pizzas cost. I know the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so I subtract the cost of the two pizzas I already know from that. That's 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Now, I know the other two pizzas cost the same amount, so I just divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2. That's 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

So, the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars each.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"So, let's figure this out. They ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, that's 3 * 5 = 15 times. Then, they ride twice as much on two other days, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. They do that for 2 days, so that's 6 * 2 = 12 times. Now, we add those together, 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"So, Bob had 7 fish in his pond. 3 of 'em were orange and 4 were white. He went to the pet store and got some more fish. He got 17 fish from the store. Now, he's got twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's figure out how many white fish he bought.

Let's say he bought W white fish. Then, he must've bought 17 - W orange fish, 'cause he got 17 fish total.

Now, he's got 3 + (17 - W) orange fish, and 4 + W white fish. We know he's got twice as many orange fish as white fish, so we can say: 3 + (17 - W) = 2(4 + W).

Simplify that: 3 + 17 - W = 8 + 2W.

Combine like terms: 20 - W = 8 + 2W.

Add W to both sides: 20 = 8 + 3W.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 12 = 3W.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

"So, Andy's car gets 10 miles per gallon, right? And gas is $3 a gallon. He goes to work 5 days a week, and it's 5 miles each way, so that's 10 miles a day. Multiply that by 5 days, that's 50 miles a week. Now, we gotta figure out how much gas he uses. If he goes 50 miles a week and his car gets 10 miles per gallon, that's 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon, which is 5 gallons a week. Now, multiply that by the price of gas, which is $3 a gallon, that's 5 gallons * $3 a gallon, which is $15 a week.

The final answer is: $15"
"So Carrie got ten twenties and 140 quarters from her aunt. She spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties. 

First, let's figure out how much money she got from the quarters. There's 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 140 * 25 cents is 3500 cents. Now, we need to change that to dollars. There's 100 cents in a dollar, so 3500 cents is 35 dollars.

Now, let's figure out how much money she got from the twenties. There's 10 twenties, and each twenty is worth 20 dollars. So, 10 * 20 is 200 dollars. Now, she spent 3/5 of that. 3/5 of 200 is 120. 

Now, we need to add the money she got from the quarters and the twenties. 35 + 120 is 155.

The final answer is: $155"
"So Ricardo's got a garden, right? He's got tomato plants and eggplant plants. Each tomato plant gives him 22 tomatoes, and each eggplant plant gives him 4 eggplants. He's got 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants.

Let's see, if he's got 5 tomato plants and each one gives him 22 tomatoes, that's 5 x 22 = 110 tomatoes. And if he's got 8 eggplant plants and each one gives him 4 eggplants, that's 8 x 4 = 32 eggplants.

So, if he's got 110 tomatoes and 32 eggplants, that's a total of... 110 + 32 = 142 fruits.

"So, Samwell sells TVs, right? They sold 40 TVs this week. Some of 'em are smart TVs, some are analog TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is like, 10 TVs. And one-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 5 TVs. 

So, if we add those two together, we get 10 + 5 = 15 TVs. That's how many smart and analog TVs they sold. 

Now, if they sold 40 TVs in total, and 15 of 'em are smart and analog, that means the rest are OLED TVs. So, we subtract 15 from 40, and that's... 25.

First, we gotta figure out how much the school's gonna give. That's half of $300, which is... um... $300 divided by 2. That's $150. 

Now, John's got $50, and the school's gonna give him $150. So, to find out how much more he needs, we gotta subtract the $50 he's got from the $150 the school's gonna give. That's $150 minus $50, which is... $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"So, Carson's pipes will freeze if it gets below 32 degrees. It's 45 degrees during the day, but it gets 33 degrees colder at night. That means it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees at night.

We need to get it up to 32 degrees, so we gotta figure out how many logs to burn. If each log heats it up by 5 degrees, we need to divide 32 by 5. That's 32 / 5 = 6.4. But you can't burn a fraction of a log, so we gotta round up. Carson needs to burn 7 logs to get it up to 32 degrees."
"So, there's this big competition and 90 people gotta split up into smaller groups. They made groups of 9 people each. Now, 3 out of 5 groups, they brought back seashells. Each of 'em brought 2 seashells.

First, we gotta figure out how many groups there are. We got 90 people and each group's got 9 people. So, we divide 90 by 9. That's 10 groups.

Now, we gotta find out how many groups brought back seashells. 3 out of 5 groups did, so we multiply 10 by 3/5. That's 6 groups.

Now, we know 6 groups brought back seashells and each group brought 2 seashells. So, we multiply 6 by 2. That's 12 seashells.

The final answer is: 12"
"So, there's a train with 172 people on it. Then, 47 people get off at the first stop. That leaves 172 - 47, which is 125 people. 

After that, 13 people get on the train, so now we got 125 + 13, which is 138 people.

Then, at the next stop, 38 people get off. So, we gotta take away 38 from 138. That's 138 - 38, which is 100.

The final answer is: 32"
"So Mike wants to buy some jeans, and they're on sale for 25% off. That means they're cheaper. The original price is $40. 

To find out how much cheaper they are, I gotta figure out 25% of 40. That's like, a quarter of 40. So, 40 * 0.25 = 10. That's how much cheaper they are.

Now, I gotta find out how much they cost after the discount. So, I subtract the discount from the original price: 40 - 10 = 30. That's how much they cost now.

Now, Mike's gonna pay with a $50 bill. I gotta find out how much he'll have left over. So, I subtract the price of the jeans from the $50 bill: 50 - 30 = 20.

"I don't rightly know how to do them fancy math problems, but I'll give it a go. 

So, Bubbles has some stuffed animals, and she wants to buy some more goats so that the goats make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. 

First, we gotta figure out how many stuffed animals she's got now. She's got 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Let's add 'em up: 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of 14. I think that's like, 30 out of 100, or 3 out of 10. So, 30% of 14 is 4.2. But we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, so we gotta round up. 

Now, let's say she buys x stuffed goats. We need to find x. We can set up an equation: (14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

But I don't know how to do them fancy math things, so let me just try some numbers. If she buys 1 goat, she's got 15 stuffed animals, and 30% of 15 is 4.5. That's still not enough. If she buys 2 goats, she's got 16 stuffed animals, and 30% of 16 is 4.8. Still not enough. If she buys 3 goats, she's got 17 stuffed animals, and 30% of 17 is 5.1. Still not enough. If she buys 4 goats, she's got 18 stuffed animals, and 30% of 18 is 5.4. Still not enough. If she buys 5 goats, she's got 19 stuffed animals, and 30% of 19 is 5.7. Still not enough. If she buys 6 goats, she's got 20 stuffed animals, and 30% of 20 is 6. Still not enough. If she buys 7 goats, she's got 21 stuffed animals, and 30% of 21 is 6.3. Still not enough.

If she buys 10 goats, she's got 24 stuffed animals, and 30% of 24 is 7.2. Still not enough. If she buys 11 goats, she's got 25 stuffed animals, and 30% of 25 is 7.5. Still not enough. If she buys 12 goats, she's got 26 stuffed animals, and 30% of 26 is 7.8. Still not enough. If she buys 13 goats, she's got 27 stuffed animals, and 30% of 27 is 8.1. Still not enough.

"So Kris wants to play video games for 30 hours. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks, and then she plays for 2 hours every day for a week. 

First, let's figure out how many hours she plays in 2 weeks. There's 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days. If she plays half an hour every day, that's 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

Then, she plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. That's 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

So, in total, she's played 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many hours she still needs to play. She wants to play 30 hours, and she's already played 21 hours. So, she needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"So, there's two cars on the highway. One's goin' 60 miles an hour, and the other's goin' 70 miles an hour. They're gonna keep goin' like that for 2 hours. I wanna know how far apart they'll be after that.

First, I gotta figure out how far each car goes in 2 hours. The first car's goin' 60 miles an hour, so in 2 hours it'll go 60 * 2 = 120 miles. The second car's goin' 70 miles an hour, so in 2 hours it'll go 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Now, I gotta find out how far apart they are. That's the difference between how far the second car went and how far the first car went. So, 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"So James buys a ring, right? It's for his bride-to-be. The diamond costs 600 bucks and the gold costs 300 bucks. He gotta pay extra for it to be made, 30% extra. That's like, a third of the whole thing.

First, you gotta add the diamond and the gold together. That's 600 + 300, which is 900 bucks.

Now, you gotta figure out how much extra he paid. A third of 900 is like, 300 bucks. So he paid 300 extra.

Now you add the extra to the original price. 900 + 300 is 1200 bucks.

The final answer is: $1200"
"So, let's figure this out. We got 340 out of 500 third-graders passin' the test. That's 340/500. Then we got 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passin', which is 40/100. Now, the fifth-graders, they had a pass rate that was twice the fourth-graders', so that's 80/100. 

Now, let's add up all the students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460. And let's add up all the students: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

Now, to find the overall pass rate, we gotta divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students, and then multiply by 100. So, that's (460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%.

The final answer is: 46"
"Milo's makin' a mosaic with glass chips. He needs 12 chips to make one square inch. He got 2 bags of chips, and each bag's got 72 chips. 

So, he's got 2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips. Now, we gotta figure out how many square inches he can make with 144 chips. 

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches. 

Now, we know the mosaic's 3 inches tall. We gotta find out how long it can be. We know the area's 12 square inches, and the height's 3 inches. 

Area's length * width, right? So, 12 = length * 3. We gotta find the length. 

12 / 3 = 4. 

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"So, there's 10 quarts of tea left from the party. Some kids drank some tea. Four kids drank 1.5 quarts each, so that's 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. Then, 16 other kids drank 2 quarts each, so that's 16 * 2 = 32 quarts. 

Now, we gotta add those together. 6 + 32 is 38 quarts. That's how much tea they drank. 

Now, we gotta figure out how much tea was there in the first place. We know there's 10 quarts left, and they drank 38 quarts. So, we add those together: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts. 

Now, I think there's 4 quarts in a gallon. So, we gotta divide 48 by 4. That's 48 / 4 = 12 gallons. 

The final answer is: 12"
"Dale got 100 candies at first. Then he sold 150. That means he's short 50 candies. But then he got 100 more. So now he's got 100 + 100 = 200 candies. He already sold 150, so he needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 more candies.

The final answer is: 50"
"So, there's 10 students at the start of the year. Then, every month, the number of students doubles. 

- January: 10 students
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

So, at the end of May, there's 160 students. To find out how many more students joined, I subtract the initial number from the final number: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"So, Felix is gettin' paid to get stuff outta trees. He charges a quarter for every branch he climbs. He made a hundred and five bucks in a week. I wanna know how many branches he climbed on average per day.

Let's see... a hundred and five dollars, that's a lotta quarters. If he charges a quarter per branch, I reckon we gotta divide a hundred and five by a quarter.

A hundred and five divided by a quarter is... 420. That's how many branches he climbed in a week.

Now, he worked for five days, so we gotta divide 420 by 5 to get the average.

420 divided by 5 is... 84.

So, Felix climbed 84 branches on average per day."
"So Rose is pickin' flowers, right? She gets 3 flowers with 5 petals each, that's 15 petals. Then she gets 4 flowers with 6 petals each, that's 24 petals. Then she gets 5 flowers with 4 petals each, that's 20 petals. And then she gets 6 flowers with 7 petals each, that's 42 petals. 

Now, let's add 'em all up: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals. But then she drops 1 petal from each bunch, so that's 4 petals gone. So we gotta take 4 away from 101. That's 97 petals.

The final answer is: 97"
"So, John and DeSean got a bag of marshmallows. They got 35 marshmallows in the bag. They made some s'mores, and they dropped some on the ground. John made 9 s'mores, and DeSean made 9 s'mores too. They dropped 3 marshmallows.

First, we gotta figure out how many marshmallows they used. John used 9, and DeSean used 9. That's 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. Then they dropped 3 more. So, they used 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows.

Now, we gotta find out how many marshmallows are left. We had 35, and they used 21. So, 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows left.

Now, we gotta figure out how many s'mores each kid can make. There's 2 kids, and there's 14 marshmallows left. So, we gotta divide 14 by 2. That's 14 / 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"So, there's this arcade and Jack goes with his 3 friends. Jack can play a game for 20 minutes with a quarter. Two of his friends are pretty bad at it, so they can only play for half as long. And one of them is really good, so they can play for 1.5 times as long. They play for 4 hours.

First, we gotta figure out how long each of them played. 4 hours is 240 minutes. Jack played for 240 minutes. The two bad friends played for half that, so that's 120 minutes each. The good friend played for 1.5 times that, so that's 360 minutes.

Now, we gotta add up all their playtime. 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Each quarter lets Jack play for 20 minutes, so that's 1/20 of a quarter per minute. We gotta multiply the total minutes by that to get the total quarters used. 840 * 1/20 = 42.

So, they used 42 quarters.

The final answer is: $42"
"So, Tanya makes this salt scrub stuff, and she puts it in a 10-ounce jar. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest. I'm tryin' to figure out how much oil she uses.

Let's see... if she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, that's like, the same thing, right? So, let's call that x. Then, the salt and sugar, they're the same too, so that's 2x. And the oil, it's twice as much as the salt, so that's 4x.

Now, we gotta add all this stuff together to get 10 ounces. So, it's x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10.

I'm not really good at math, but I think I can do this. Let's see... 8x = 10. If we divide both sides by 8, we get x = 10 / 8. That's like, 1.25.

Now, we gotta find out how much oil she uses. It's 4x, so that's 4 * 1.25. That's... 5.

So, Tanya uses 5 ounces of oil.

The final answer is: 5"
"So John goes to the market and buys some goats and cows. He buys 3 goats for 500 bucks each and 2 cows for 1500 bucks each. I gotta figure out how much he spent.

First, I gotta find out how much he spent on the goats. He bought 3 goats for 500 bucks each, so that's 3 x 500 = 1500 bucks.

Then, I gotta find out how much he spent on the cows. He bought 2 cows for 1500 bucks each, so that's 2 x 1500 = 3000 bucks.

Now, I gotta add the two together to find out how much he spent in total. 1500 + 3000 = 4500 bucks.

The final answer is: $4500"
"So Paul needs cupcakes for a party. He's got some already, but not enough. He needs 63 cupcakes in total. He's got 8 chocolate ones and 40 toffee ones. Let's count 'em together: 8 + 40 = 48. That's how many he's got. Now, we gotta find out how many more he needs. We do that by subtractin' the ones he's got from the ones he needs. So, 63 - 48 = 15. That's how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy."
"So, Joe's got twice as many cars as Robert. And Robert's got 20 cars. That means Joe's got 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of 'em. That's like, a fifth of 'em. So, he sells 40 * 0.2 = 8 cars.

Then, he gives away twice as many as he sold. That's 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

So, he gave away a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

Now, to find out how many he's got left, we gotta subtract the ones he gave away from the ones he started with. That's 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"So, there's 20 students raisin' money for charity. They all earn the same amount. They got a total of $175,000. But $50,000 of that came from other places, not the students. So, we gotta find out how much the students raised.

We subtract the $50,000 from the total, so $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000. That's how much the students raised.

Now, we gotta divide that by the number of students, which is 20. So, $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"So Sandy walked from one place to another for 8 hours one day. Then she walked half that time the next day. That's 4 hours. 

To find out how long she walked in total, we gotta add those two times together. 8 hours is 8 * 60 minutes, that's 480 minutes. 4 hours is 4 * 60 minutes, that's 240 minutes. 

So, 480 + 240 is 720 minutes. 

The final answer is: 720"
"So, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot when he went to class. Then, 20 more cars came in, so now there's 50 + 20 = 70 cars. 

Now, when he went out for lunch, half of the cars left. That's 1/2 of 70, which is 35. So, half of the cars left, and that means there's 70 - 35 = 35 cars left.

So, when he went out for lunch, there were 35 cars in the parking lot.

The final answer is: 35"
"So John does 30 cycles a day, and each cycle got 5 tasks. Each task pays a buck twenty. I wanna know how much he makes in a week.

First, I gotta figure out how much he makes in a day. He does 30 cycles, and each cycle got 5 tasks. That's 30 * 5 = 150 tasks. And each task pays a buck twenty, so that's 150 * 1.20 = 180 bucks a day.

Now, I gotta figure out how much he makes in a week. There's 7 days in a week, so I multiply 180 by 7. That's 1260 bucks.

"So Sasha and Julie are playin' basketball, right? They got two games. In the first game, Sasha's team was at home and she scored 14 points. Now, Julie, she scored 4 less than Sasha in that game. So, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

Now, in the second game, Sasha's team was at Julie's place, and Sasha don't do good at away games. She scored 6 less points than Julie did in the first game. Julie scored 10 points in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

So, Sasha scored 14 points in the first game and 4 points in the second game. Let's add 'em up: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"So, Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and 6 packages of dog food. Now, I gotta figure out how many more tins of cat food she got than dog food.

Each package of cat food has 11 tins, so if she got 8 packages, that's 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Each package of dog food has 6 tins, so if she got 6 packages, that's 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, I gotta find out how many more tins of cat food she got than dog food. That's 88 - 36 = 52.

"So, there's three people, Becca, Smendrick, and PJ. They got a bunch of Magic Cards. Together, they got 341 cards. Becca got more than Smendrick, and Smendrick got three times as many as PJ.

Let's say PJ got x cards. Then Smendrick got 3x cards 'cause he got three times as many as PJ. And Becca got 3x + 12 'cause she got 12 more than Smendrick.

So, if we add 'em all up, we get x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341. That's like, all the cards they got.

Now, let's simplify this. We can add the x's together, so it's like 7x + 12 = 341. Then we subtract 12 from both sides, so it's 7x = 329.

Now, we gotta get x by itself. We do that by dividin' both sides by 7. So, x = 329 / 7. That's like, 47.

So PJ got 47 cards. Smendrick got 3 times that, so he got 141 cards. And Becca got 3 times 47 plus 12, so she got 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"

Then she got one less pink one than blue ones, so that's 9 pink ones. And then she got one-third as many yellow ones as pink ones, so that's 3 yellow ones.

Let me count 'em all up: 5 green, 10 blue, 9 pink, and 3 yellow. That's 5 + 10 + 9 + 3. That's 27."
"So Milly's got a book she don't wanna keep. It's 4 pounds, cost her 32 bucks, and it's 20 miles away from her. The shipping place charges 35 cents a pound and 8 cents a mile. And Amazon's only gonna give her 75% of the money back.

First, let's figure out how much shipping is gonna cost. It's 35 cents a pound, so 4 pounds is 35 * 4 = 140 cents, or 1.4 dollars. Then it's 8 cents a mile, so 20 miles is 8 * 20 = 160 cents, or 1.6 dollars. So shipping's gonna be 1.4 + 1.6 = 2.99 dollars.

Now, Amazon's gonna give her 75% of the 32 bucks back, which is 0.75 * 32 = 24 dollars. So she's gonna get 24 dollars back.

Now, let's figure out how much she's gonna lose. She's gonna pay 2.99 dollars for shipping, and she's only getting 24 dollars back. So she's gonna lose 2.99 + (32 - 24) = 2.99 + 8 = 10.99 dollars.

The first week, he makes 8,000 bars. That's a lot of chocolate. Then, the second week, he makes half of that, which is 4,000 bars. That's less than the first week.

Now, the third week, he makes three times as much as the first week, which is 24,000 bars. That's a lot of chocolate too.

So, let's add up how much he made in the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Now, we need to find out how much he made in the fourth week. We know he makes 50,000 bars in a month, so we subtract the 36,000 bars he made in the first three weeks from that.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

So, Boris made 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"So, Britany makes 18 videos a week on TikTok, and each one is 4 minutes long. That's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes. She also spends 2 hours a week writin' songs, which is 120 minutes. And she does her makeup for 15 minutes, 6 days a week, that's 90 minutes. 

So, we gotta add all that up. 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes. Now, we gotta convert that to hours. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 282 by 60. That's 4.7 hours. 

Now, we gotta multiply that by 4, 'cause there's 4 weeks in a month. 4.7 * 4 = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: 18.8"
"So, Angela's got a bunch of stuff she wants installed. She's got 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. The interior design firm already does 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures for $129.00. Now, Angela's got extra stuff she wants done. She's got 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures. They charge $15.00 for each extra thing.

So, for the extra mirrors, that's 2 * $15.00 = $30.00. For the extra chandelier, that's 1 * $15.00 = $15.00. And for the extra pictures, that's 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, we add all that up: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00. That's how much extra it's gonna cost her.

Now, we gotta add that to the original $129.00. So, $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"So, let's figure this out. Eva saved $20.00. Anthony saved $10.00 more than Eva, so he saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00. Now, Roy saved 40% more than Anthony. That's like, a quarter more. So, we gotta find a quarter of $30.00. That's $30.00 * 0.25 = $7.50. Now, we add that to what Anthony saved, so $30.00 + $7.50 = $37.50. But wait, that's not right. We gotta add the $7.50 to Anthony's $30.00, but we gotta do it as a percentage. So, we do $30.00 + ($30.00 * 0.4) = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"So, you wanna know how high Naruto can lift a mountain? Alright, let me break it down. 

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. 

Then, Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, which is 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 

Now, Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

There's 12 inches in a foot, so we gotta convert 480 inches to feet. 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"Mason's goin' on a bike ride. He's goin' 8 miles an hour. He rides for 4 hours, then takes a break, and then rides for another 6 hours. I wanna know how far he's gone.

First, he rides for 4 hours at 8 miles an hour. That's 8 x 4 = 32 miles. Then he rides for another 6 hours at the same speed, so that's 8 x 6 = 48 miles. 

Now, I gotta add those two numbers together. 32 + 48 = 80 miles.

The final answer is: 80"
"So, if three kangaroos can cross a highway in 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take 18 * 3 hours, which is 54 hours. 

Now, if the turtles are goin' half as fast as the kangaroos, it's gonna take 'em twice as long. So, we gotta multiply 54 hours by 2.

That's 108 hours."
"So, Kora made 20 dishes. Rory made 20 more than Kora, so Rory made 40 dishes. Jada made twice as many as Rory, so Jada made 80 dishes. 

To find out how many they made in total, I just add 'em up: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"So Erika wants a new laptop. It costs $600. But if she trades in her old one, it's cheaper. It's $200 cheaper. So it's $600 - $200 = $400.

She got $150 from her job and her mom gave her $80. That's $150 + $80 = $230.

She needs $50 more to buy the laptop. So she has $400 + $50 = $450. And she already had $230. So she had $450 - $230 = $220 in her purse.

The final answer is: $220"
"So Adam wants to eat some sliced apples. He gets 3 big apples and 5 little apples. Big apples can be cut into 5 pieces, and little apples can be cut into 3 pieces.

He cuts the big apples into 3 x 5 = 15 pieces. And he cuts the little apples into 5 x 3 = 15 pieces.

So he has 15 + 15 = 30 pieces of apple in total.

Then he eats 15 of them. So he has 30 - 15 = 15 pieces left.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, the farmer gets 5 liters of milk from each cow every day. He's got 3 cows now. He wants to get 25 liters of milk a day. 

To get 25 liters, we gotta figure out how many cows he needs. If 1 cow gives 5 liters, then 25 liters would be... 25 divided by 5. That's 5 cows. 

He's got 3 cows now, so he needs... 5 cows - 3 cows = 2 more cows."
"So, Patrick's got three glue sticks, and they're all used a bit. One's got 1/6 left, another's got 2/3 left, and the last one's got 1/2 left. Now, I know a glue stick's 12 millimeters long, and I wanna know how much of 'em's not used.

The first one's got 1/6 left, so I multiply 12 by 1/6. That's like, 12 divided by 6, which is 2. So, 2 millimeters.

The second one's got 2/3 left, so I multiply 12 by 2/3. That's like, 12 divided by 3, then times 2. That's 8 millimeters.

The third one's got 1/2 left, so I multiply 12 by 1/2. That's like, 12 divided by 2, which is 6. So, 6 millimeters.

Now, I add 'em all up: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"Gabriel wants to buy a car for 10,000 dollars and a phone for 800 dollars. He got 5,000 dollars from workin' on the weekends and his brother gave him 200 dollars. 

First, you gotta add up how much he got. 5,000 + 200 is 5,200. Now, you gotta add up how much he owes. 10,000 for the car and 800 for the phone is 10,800. 

Now, you gotta subtract how much he got from how much he owes. 10,800 - 5,200 is 4,600. Gabriel still needs 4,600 dollars."
"So Thea bought a hat for $70. She gave the guy who made it four $20 bills. I wanna know how much change she got.

First, I gotta figure out how much money she gave him. She gave him four $20 bills, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 dollars.

Now, I gotta subtract the cost of the hat from the money she gave him. So, 80 - 70 = 10.

Thea got 10 dollars as change."
"So Craig got 2 twenties, that's $40. He buys some squirt guns for $2 each, and he gets 6 of 'em. That's 6 x 2, which is $12. Then he buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, that's 3 x 3, which is $9. So he spent $12 + $9, that's $21. Now we gotta take away $21 from $40, that's $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"So, let's figure this out. Jack got 60 dishes. He got twice as many dishes as socks, so he got 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Now, Peter got twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter got 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

And Peter got half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter got 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's count all the socks and dishes together. Jack got 30 socks and 60 dishes, that's 90 things. Peter got 60 socks and 30 dishes, that's 90 things. So, together they got 90 + 90 = 180 things."
"So, there's 20 kids in Miss Susan's class. Some of 'em are good at math, some are good at English, and some are good at both. Now, 5 of 'em are only good at math, and 8 of 'em are only good at English. That means the rest are good at both, right? So, if we take away the ones who are only good at math and only good at English, we get the ones who are good at both.

20 kids in total, minus the 5 who are only good at math, minus the 8 who are only good at English... that's 20 - 5 - 8 = 7. So, 7 kids are good at both.

Now, if 7 kids are good at both, that means they're counted twice - once in the math group and once in the English group. So, to get the total number of kids who are good at math, we gotta add the 5 who are only good at math to the 7 who are good at both.

5 + 7 = 12

"So, Vicki's got a concert at her high school. It's gonna be 2 hours long. Each group gets 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to get off. Then there's a 10-minute break in the middle. 

Let's figure out how many groups can go on. Each group takes 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes. That's how long they need. The concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. But we gotta take away the 10-minute break, so we got 110 minutes left.

Now, we gotta divide 110 by 10. That's how many groups can go on. 110 divided by 10 is... 11.

"So, Brenda puts in 300 bucks into somethin'. It's like a savings thingy that makes more money, but it don't make it all at once. It makes a little bit more each year. It makes 3/4 of the original amount each year. That's like, 75% of the original amount.

So, the first year, she gets 300 * 0.75 = 225 bucks. That's the interest. So, she's got 300 + 225 = 525 bucks.

The next year, she's got 525 bucks, and she gets 525 * 0.75 = 393.75 bucks in interest. So, she's got 525 + 393.75 = 918.75 bucks.

The next year, she's got 918.75 bucks, and she gets 918.75 * 0.75 = 688.06 bucks in interest. So, she's got 918.75 + 688.06 = 1606.81 bucks.

So, after 3 years, Brenda's got 1606.81 bucks.

The final answer is: $1606.81"
"So, there's a store with shirts. They got 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Now, half of them white shirts got collars, so that's 20 shirts. That means the other half, 20 shirts, don't got no collars.

Now, let's look at the floral shirts. 20 of them got buttons. That means the other 30 don't got no buttons.

So, we gotta find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there is than white shirts with no collars. That's 30 - 20. 

The final answer is: 10"
"So the farmer got 900 eggs. He puts 'em on a tray, and each tray holds 30 eggs. He wants to know how much he'll get if he sells 'em for $2.5 a tray.

First, we gotta figure out how many trays he got. We do that by divin' the number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray. That's 900 eggs divided by 30 eggs per tray. That's 30 trays.

Now, we gotta multiply the number of trays by the price per tray. That's 30 trays times $2.5 per tray. That's $75.

"So, Mr. Smith got 55 goats in one farm, Farm X, and 45 goats in another farm, Farm Y. Then he sold some goats. He sold 10 goats from Farm X. That means he's got 55 - 10 = 45 goats left in Farm X.

Now, he sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. That means he sold 10 * 2 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, he's got 45 - 20 = 25 goats left in Farm Y.

Now, we gotta count how many goats he's got in total. We add the goats from Farm X and Farm Y. 45 + 25 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"So, James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. That's a lotta shoes. He spends $2640 on shoes each year. I wanna know how much he pays on average for each pair.

Let's see... He buys 2 pairs a month, and there's 12 months in a year. That's 2 x 12 = 24 pairs a year. Now, we gotta divide the money he spends on shoes by the number of pairs he buys. That's $2640 divided by 24.

$2640 / 24 = $110

I think that's right."
"So you wanna know how much it'll cost if you buy 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food. Alright, so the green food costs 25 bucks a basket, and the red food costs 18 bucks a basket. If you buy 3 of each, that's 3 * 25 for the green ones, which is 75 bucks, and 3 * 18 for the red ones, which is 54 bucks. So that's 75 + 54, which is 129 bucks. But, you get 2 bucks off for each red basket, so that's 3 * 2, which is 6 bucks off. So, you gotta subtract that from 129, which is 123 bucks.

The final answer is: $123"
"So, there's a motel with 90 rooms, and they gotta clean 'em all. But we only wanna know how long it takes to clean half of 'em. That's 45 rooms. Now, it takes 20 minutes to clean one room. So, we gotta multiply 45 by 20.

45 * 20 = 900 minutes

Now, we gotta turn that into hours. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 900 by 60.

900 / 60 = 15

So, it takes 15 hours to clean half the rooms.

"So, the town is gonna build some houses. They're gonna build 12 houses in the first year. Then, they're gonna build three times that many in the second year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 houses. 

Now, they're gonna count all the houses they built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 houses. Then, they're gonna double that number, so it's 2 * 48 = 96 houses.

So, in the third year, they'll build 96 houses. Now, we gotta add up all the houses they built. That's 12 + 36 + 96. Let's see... 12 + 36 is 48, and 48 + 96 is 144.

"Mr. Jackson's class got 27 kids. He wants to give each kid 2 glue sticks. Glue sticks come in packs of 8. How many packs does he need to buy?

First, we gotta figure out how many glue sticks he needs in total. There's 27 kids and each kid gets 2 glue sticks, so that's 27 * 2 = 54 glue sticks.

Now, we gotta see how many packs he needs. Each pack has 8 glue sticks. So, we divide 54 by 8. That's 54 ÷ 8 = 6.75. But you can't buy a fraction of a pack, so he needs to buy a whole number of packs.

So, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"So, there's a river and it's got 4000 gallons of water goin' through it one day. Then it rains a lot and the water doubles, so now it's 8000 gallons. Then on the third day, it goes up by 6000 more gallons, so that's 14000 gallons. 

So, if you add all that up, you get 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"So, there's this plague that infects people. It starts with 10 people. Each of them infects 6 other people every day. I wanna know how many people are infected after 3 days.

Day 1: 10 people are already infected. They infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people. So, we got 10 + 60 = 70 people infected.

Day 2: Now we got 70 people. They infect 70 * 6 = 420 new people. And the 10 people from the start infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people. So, we got 70 + 420 + 60 = 550 people infected.

Day 3: Now we got 550 people. They infect 550 * 6 = 3300 new people. The 60 people from Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people. And the 10 people from the start infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people. So, we got 550 + 3300 + 360 + 60 = 3270 people infected.

The final answer is: 3270"
"So, there's this restaurant and 40 people came in. Each one gave Rafaela $20. That's 40 * 20 = 800 dollars. Now, Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela. 10% of 800 is 80, so Julieta got 800 - 80 = 720 dollars. 

So, together they got 800 + 720 = 1520 dollars.

The final answer is: $1520"
"Jennifer got 12 oranges from the market. She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. Then she gave her boy 3 oranges. So, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, we gotta find out how many oranges Jennifer got left. We gotta subtract the oranges she gave away from the ones she got. So, 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"So, Claire gets a badge every month. Amber takes longer to get a badge, twice as long as Claire. That means Amber gets half a badge every month. And Wendy, she gets three times as many badges as Claire in the same time. That's 3 badges every month.

Now, let's see how many badges they get in a year. There's 12 months in a year. So, Claire gets 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges. Amber gets 0.5 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges. And Wendy gets 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges.

Now, we gotta find out how many more badges Wendy gets than Amber. That's 36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges.

The final answer is: 30"
"So, Paige bakes banana bread. She can make 2 loaves an hour. Each loaf gets cut into 8 slices. She sells each slice for 50 cents. She bakes from 1 to 6, that's 5 hours. So, she makes 2 loaves an hour, that's 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. 

Each loaf is 8 slices, so that's 10 * 8 = 80 slices. Now, she sells each slice for 50 cents. We gotta turn that into dollars, so we divide by 100. 80 / 100 = 0.8 dollars per slice. 

Now, we multiply the slices by the price per slice. 0.8 * 80 = 64 dollars. 

The final answer is: $64"
"So, Gretchen got some coins. She got more gold coins than silver coins. I'm told she got 70 gold coins. I gotta figure out how many coins she got in total.

Let's see... if she got 70 gold coins and she got more gold than silver, that means she got 30 more silver coins than gold. So, if she got 70 gold, she musta got 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.

Now, I gotta add 'em up. She got 40 silver coins and 70 gold coins. That's 40 + 70 = 110 coins.

"So, there's this teacher, George, and he ordered 600 burritos for the sixth-grade class picnic. There's 50 kids there, and each kid gets 10 burritos. Then there's Mr. George, he eats 20 of 'em.

First, we gotta figure out how many burritos the kids ate. There's 50 kids, and each kid gets 10 burritos, so that's 50 * 10 = 500 burritos. Then Mr. George eats 20 more. So, in total, they ate 500 + 20 = 520 burritos.

Now, we gotta find out how many burritos are left. We started with 600 burritos, and they ate 520. So, 600 - 520 = 80 burritos left.

The final answer is: 80"
"So, there's this bumper car rink with 12 red cars. They got less green cars than red cars, 2 less. That means they got 10 green cars.

Now, they got 3 times as many blue cars as green cars. That's 3 * 10, which is 30 blue cars.

So, we got 12 red, 10 green, and 30 blue cars. That's 52 cars in total. 

If they got 75 cars in total, that means they got 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's figure this out. We got three people, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn, and they got 85 books together. Sofie got more books than Anne, and Anne got more books than Fawn. 

Let's say Fawn got F books. Then Anne got F - 12 books, 'cause she got 12 less than Fawn. And Sofie got F - 12 + 25 books, 'cause she got 25 more than Anne.

So, we got F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85. That's all the books they got together.

Now, let's simplify this. F + F - 12 + F - 12 + 25 = 85. That's 3F + 1 = 85.

Now, we gotta get rid of that 1. So, we subtract 1 from both sides. That's 3F = 84.

Now, we gotta get F by itself. So, we divide both sides by 3. That's F = 28.

So, Fawn got 28 books."
"So, Daisy got a bag of potatoes that's 5 pounds. Then she got a bag of sweet potatoes that's twice as heavy as the potatoes. That's 2 * 5 = 10 pounds. 

Now, the carrots, they're 3 pounds lighter than the sweet potatoes. So, we gotta subtract 3 from 10. That's 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. 

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"So Greg wants to know how much Jello he's gonna spend. He's makin' Jello cups for his son's party and he needs 30 kids to have 4 cups each. That's 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Now, one box of Jello makes 10 cups, so he needs 120 / 10 = 12 boxes.

Each box costs $1.25, so he's gonna spend 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"So, the guy bought 5 phones for $700 each. That's a lotta money. He gave the seller $4000. I wanna know how much change he gets back.

First, I gotta find out how much all them phones cost. You multiply the number of phones by the price of each phone. So, 5 phones * $700 = $3500. That's how much the phones cost.

Now, I gotta find out how much change he gets. I take the $4000 he gave and subtract the $3500 the phones cost. $4000 - $3500 = $500.

So, the guy gets $500 back."
"So, Madeline and her roommate Keenan, they split the grocery bill. They spend like, 400 bucks a month. Now, we gotta figure out how much Keenan spends a week. 

Madeline pays 60% of the bill, so Keenan pays the rest, which is 40%. To find out how much Keenan pays, we gotta multiply 400 by 40%... or 0.4. 

So, 400 x 0.4 = 160. That's how much Keenan pays in a month. Now, we gotta divide that by 4, 'cause there's 4 weeks in a month. 

160 / 4 = 40. So, Keenan spends 40 bucks a week on groceries.

The final answer is: $40"
"So, Tobias got a big pizza with 60 pieces. He ate some on the first day, some on the second day, and some on the third day. Let's figure it out.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the pizza. That's like, 2 parts out of 5. So, 2/5 * 60 is... um... 2 * 12 is 24. So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

Then, on the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's see how many pieces were left. 60 - 24 - 10 is... 26. That's how many pieces were left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. That's like, 7 parts out of 13. So, 7/13 * 26 is... um... 7 * 2 is 14. So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate: 24 + 10 + 14 = 48.

"So, you wanna know how much it'll cost if David buys 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. 

First, let's figure out how much one bottle of soda costs. If 7 bottles cost 21 dollars, then one bottle costs 21 divided by 7, which is 3 dollars.

Now, let's do the same for water. If 4 bottles cost 8 dollars, then one bottle costs 8 divided by 4, which is 2 dollars.

Now, we gotta find out how much 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water cost. Three bottles of soda is 3 times 3 dollars, which is 9 dollars. Two bottles of water is 2 times 2 dollars, which is 4 dollars.

So, if you add 'em together, 9 dollars plus 4 dollars is 13 dollars.

The final answer is: $13.00"
"So David got 12 dollars and 48 cents. He wants to buy 16 bolts. Each bolt costs 3 cents. I gotta figure out how much money he's got left.

First, I gotta find out how much the bolts cost. There's 16 bolts and each one's 3 cents, so I multiply 16 by 3. That's 48 cents.

Now, I gotta take away the cost of the bolts from the money David had. He had 12 dollars and 48 cents. I take away 48 cents from that. That's 12 dollars and 0 cents.

So, David's got 12 dollars left."
"So Ella gets paid $33 for walkin' dogs for 3 hours. I wanna know how much she gets paid if she walks dogs for 12 hours. 

First, I gotta figure out how much she gets paid per hour. I do that by divvin' the money she gets ($33) by the hours she works (3). That's $33 ÷ 3 = $11 per hour.

Now, I multiply the hourly pay ($11) by the new hours she's gonna work (12). That's $11 * 12 = $132.

"So, Isaias wants to make $2000 profit from sellin' chickens. He's gonna sell 'em for $50 each. He's got 300 chickens, but he's only gonna sell 3/5 of 'em. That's 3 out of 5, or 60% of the chickens. 

To find out how many chickens he's gonna sell, I'll multiply 300 by 3/5. That's 300 * 3 = 900, then I'll divide by 5. 900 / 5 = 180. So, he's gonna sell 180 chickens.

Now, I'll multiply the number of chickens by the price he's gonna sell 'em for. 180 * 50 = 9000. That's how much he's gonna make from sellin' the chickens.

But, he wants to make a profit of $2000, so I'll add that to the amount he's gonna make. 9000 + 2000 = 11000. That's how much he needs to make.

Now, I need to find out how much he spent on the chickens. I'll subtract the profit from the amount he needs to make. 11000 - 2000 = 9000. That's how much he spent on the chickens.

The final answer is: $9000"

"Sarah's got a rope that's 20 meters long. She's gonna sell it to her friend for 2 bucks a meter. That's a lot of money. She's gonna use that money to buy a new rope that costs 1.5 bucks a meter. I don't know how long the new rope is, but I'm gonna assume it's the same length as the old one, 20 meters.

First, let's figure out how much money Sarah gets from selling the old rope. You multiply the length by the price per meter. So, 20 meters times 2 bucks a meter is... um... 40 bucks.

Now, let's figure out how much the new rope costs. You multiply the length by the price per meter. So, 20 meters times 1.5 bucks a meter is... um... 30 bucks.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah got from selling the old rope. That's 40 bucks minus 30 bucks. That's... 10 bucks.

"So Kelly's goin' shoppin' and she's got a bunch of stuff in her cart. She's got 5 packs of bacon, that's $10. Then she's got 6 packets of chicken, and each one's twice as much as the bacon, so that's 6 * 2 * 10 = 120 dollars. Then she's got 3 packs of strawberries, that's 3 * 4 = 12 dollars. And she's got 7 packs of apples, and each one's half the price of the strawberries, so that's 7 * 2 = 14 dollars.

So now we gotta add all that up. 10 + 120 + 12 + 14 = 156 dollars. That's how much she spent. Now we gotta subtract that from her budget, which is 65 dollars. So 65 - 156 = -91."
"So, Elaina's concert is longer than usual, right? It's like, twice as long. And then she does this extra 15-minute thing at the end. I think it's called an encore. 

So, the whole thing is 65 minutes long. If we take away the 15 minutes of the encore, that leaves us with 65 - 15, which is 50 minutes. That's how long the concert itself is. But we know it's twice as long as her usual concert, so we gotta divide 50 by 2 to find out how long her usual concert is.

50 divided by 2 is 25. So, her usual concert is 25 minutes long.

"So, the singer got 50 microphones and he wants to put 'em in pairs. But, 20% of 'em won't fit. That means 80% of 'em will fit. 

80% of 50 is like, 4/5 of 50. That's 40. So, 40 microphones will be in pairs. Since each pair has 2 microphones, we gotta divide 40 by 2 to get the number of pairs.

40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer can put 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

Let's figure out how much one carrot costs. If she eats 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt, and it all costs 11 bucks, we gotta find out how much one carrot costs. We know the salad is 6 bucks and the yogurt is 3 bucks. So, 2 carrots and the other stuff cost 11 - 6 - 3 = 2 bucks. That's 2 bucks for 2 carrots.

To find out how much one carrot costs, we divide 2 by 2. That's 1 buck. So, one carrot costs 1 buck."
"So Mark works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. That's a lotta hours. He used to get 10 bucks an hour, but now he gets 2 more bucks an hour. That's 12 bucks an hour now.

So, he works 8 hours a day, that's 8 x 5 days, that's 40 hours a week. And he gets 12 bucks an hour, so that's 40 x 12, that's... 480 bucks a week.

The final answer is: $480"
"So, Tasha made 80 bucks last month from sellin' lemonade and mowin' lawns. She mowed Joe's lawn for 6 bucks. Now, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, and Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's. 

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. So, in total, she mowed 9x lawns.

She made 6 bucks for mowin' Joe's lawn, so she made 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x bucks from mowin' lawns. We know she made 80 bucks total, so we gotta figure out how much she made from lemonade.

Let's say she made y bucks from lemonade. Then 54x + y = 80. We know she made 6 bucks for mowin' Joe's lawn, so x = 1. Now we can plug that in: 54(1) + y = 80.

54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

So, she made 26 bucks from lemonade.

The final answer is: $26"
"So, you wanna know how much Harry weighs. Alright, let's figure it out. 

First, we gotta know how much Martin weighs. He's 55 kg. Now, Carl is 16 kg more than Martin, so Carl is 55 + 16 = 71 kg. Then, Christian is 8 kg more than Carl, so Christian is 71 + 8 = 79 kg. Now, Harry is 5 kg less than Christian, so Harry is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"So, John rents his car out a lotta times, 10 times a month. He rents it for 3 hours each time. He gets paid 25 bucks an hour. His car payment is 500 bucks. I wanna know how much profit he makes.

First, I gotta figure out how much he makes in a month. He rents it 10 times, for 3 hours each time, so that's 10 * 3 = 30 hours. Then I multiply that by how much he gets paid an hour, which is 25 bucks. So, 30 * 25 = 750 bucks.

Now, I gotta subtract his car payment from that. So, 750 - 500 = 250 bucks.

The final answer is: $250"
"So Martha had some notebooks, and then she got 5 more. Now she's got 7. That means she had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks before. 

Now, Joseph's got 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. So, Joseph's got 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, Martha's got 7 notebooks and Joseph's got 6. So, Martha's got 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: 1"
"So, Dijana and Anis, they go rowin' on the lake, right? Dijana rows 50 miles, that's a lot. Anis rows more than Dijana, 1/5 more. 

To find out how much more Anis rows, I gotta find 1/5 of 50. That's like, 50 divided by 5, which is 10. So Anis rows 10 more miles than Dijana.

Anis rows 50 + 10, that's 60 miles. Now, I gotta add Dijana's miles to Anis's miles. 50 + 60 is 110.

The final answer is: 110"
"So, Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas. Then her husband took 4 cookies for himself. Now we gotta figure out how many cookies each of her 6 nephews will get.

First, we gotta know how many cookies are left. We subtract the cookies her husband took from the total. 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Now, we gotta divide the cookies by the number of nephews. We got 96 cookies and 6 nephews. 96 / 6 = 16 cookies per nephew.

The final answer is: 16"
"So Denise and Daniel are readin' a book. Denise read 10 pages yesterday and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday. Daniel didn't read nothin' today.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13. Today, Denise read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday, so that's 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Daniel didn't read nothin' today, so he read 0 pages.

Denise read 10 yesterday and 18 today, so that's 10 + 18 = 28 pages. Daniel read 13 yesterday and 0 today, so that's 13 + 0 = 13 pages.

Denise read 28 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. So Denise read 28 - 13 = 15 more pages than Daniel.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, Calvin's makin' soup for his family. He's got a big pot that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 kid bowls. He's gonna eat with his wife and their two kids. That's 3 adults and 2 kids, so 5 people in total. They're all gonna eat one bowl each.

The pot's got enough for 8 kid bowls, but they only used 4 kid bowls for dinner. That means there's 4 kid bowls left. Now, the two kids wanna have some soup for lunch. If they each get one bowl, how many times can they have soup for lunch?

Let's see... there's 4 kid bowls left, and there's 2 kids. If they each get one bowl, that's 2 bowls. So, they can have soup for lunch 2 times.

The final answer is: 2"
"So, William bought 5 notebooks and a pen. Notebooks cost 1.50 dollars each and the pen costs 0.5 dollars. 

First, I gotta find out how much the notebooks cost. 5 notebooks is 5 x 1.50 dollars. That's 7.50 dollars. Then I gotta add the cost of the pen, which is 0.5 dollars. So, 7.50 + 0.5 is 8 dollars.

The final answer is: $8"
"So, Jo's makin' face masks, right? She needs to know how much material to get. She can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, and 3 big masks with 2.25 yards of material. 

First, let's figure out how much material she needs for the small masks. If she can make 4 small masks with 2 yards, that's like 2 yards divided by 4 masks. That's 0.5 yards per mask. Now, she needs to make 20 small masks, so that's 20 * 0.5 yards. That's 10 yards.

Now, let's do the big masks. She can make 3 big masks with 2.25 yards, so that's 2.25 yards divided by 3 masks. That's 0.75 yards per mask. Now, she needs to make 8 big masks, so that's 8 * 0.75 yards. That's 6 yards.

So, in total, she needs 10 yards for the small masks and 6 yards for the big masks. That's 10 + 6 = 16 yards.

The final answer is: 16"
"So, Deepa saw 9 movies, and she saw each one 3 times. That's a lotta movies. She spent 216 bucks seein' 'em. I wanna know how much she paid per ticket.

She saw 9 movies 3 times, so she saw 9 x 3 = 27 movies. That's a lot of tickets.

Now, I gotta figure out how much she paid per ticket. I'll just divide the money she spent by the number of tickets. That's 216 dollars divided by 27 tickets.

Let me think... 216 divided by 27 is... 8.

The final answer is: $8"
"So, Harold sleeps 10 hours a night. That's a lotta sleep. He works 2 hours less than that, so he works 8 hours. And he walks his dog for 1 hour. 

Let's see, there's 24 hours in a day. If he sleeps 10, works 8, and walks his dog 1, that's 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours. 

So, he's got 24 - 19 = 5 hours left. That's his free time."
"So, Tim's got 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. He takes 3 blue ones and 3 red ones to go fishin'. 

Now, let's see how many he's got left. He's got 7 blue shoeboxes, and he took 3, so he's got 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoeboxes left.

He's got 9 red shoeboxes, and he took 3, so he's got 9 - 3 = 6 red shoeboxes left.

So, he's got 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left.

The final answer is: 10"
"So, Sarah's got 9 books, right? And Joseph, he's got twice as many as Sarah. That means he's got 9 * 2, which is 18 books. But then he lost 2, so now he's got 18 - 2, which is... 16."
"So Dean's got 30 marbles, right? He gives some to Jamie. He gives Jamie 1/5 of 'em. That's like, a fifth. So, if you divide 30 by 5, that's 6. He gives Jamie 6 marbles.

Then he gives 10 to Donald. So now he's given away 6 + 10, that's 16 marbles.

Now, we gotta find out how many he's got left. We gotta subtract the marbles he gave away from the ones he started with. So, 30 minus 16 is... 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"So, you wanna know about Duncan and Adam's ages, right? Alright, let's figure it out.

Duncan's age is 60 now. Eight years ago, he was 60 - 8 = 52 years old. Now, I'm told that his age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. That means Adam's age four years ago was 52 / 2 = 26.

So, Adam was 26 four years ago. That makes him 26 + 4 = 30 years old now. And if he's 30 now, in 8 years, he'll be 30 + 8 = 38.

The final answer is: 38"
"So, Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. And Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that. 

Twice 200 is 400. Then you gotta add 100 to that, so it's 400 + 100 = 500. That's how many acres Farmer Smith's farm is.

Now, we gotta add the acres of both farms together. 200 + 500 = 700.

The final answer is: 700"
"So Colby works in a factory, packin' stuff. He gets paid 20 cents for every package he does. He does 40 packages an hour, 'cause he does 10 less than 50. That's just how it is.

Now, he works 8 hours a day. That's a long time. So, he does 40 packages an hour, that's 40 * 8, which is 320 packages. That's a lotta packages.

Now, he gets 20 cents for every package. So, we gotta multiply 320 by 20 cents. That's 320 * 0.20. That's 64 dollars.

The final answer is: $64"
"So, John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. That's like, 30 minutes. And he does this for a long time, like, solving puzzles. 

A normal puzzle takes him 45 minutes. That's like, a little while. But an extreme puzzle takes 4 times as long as that. So, 45 * 4 is... um... 180 minutes. Yeah, that's a lot of time.

Now, we gotta figure out how many bottles of water he drinks in that time. He drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, so we gotta divide the total time by 30. That's like, 180 / 30. That's... 6. Yeah, he drinks 6 bottles of water."
"So, Benny threw bologna at some balloons. He threw 2 pieces at the red ones and 3 pieces at the yellow ones. He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. There's 20 red balloons. I wanna know how many yellow balloons there are.

Let's see... If he threw 2 pieces at each red balloon, that's 2 x 20 = 40 pieces. That's how many he threw at the red ones. So, he threw 58 - 40 = 18 pieces at the yellow ones.

Now, if he threw 3 pieces at each yellow balloon, I gotta divide 18 by 3 to find out how many yellow balloons there are. 18 / 3 = 6.

So, there's 6 yellow balloons."
"So Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, right? And he drives 100 miles a day. He drives for 30 days, so let's see how many miles he drives in that time.

He drives 100 miles a day, and he does that for 30 days. That's 100 * 30 = 3000 miles. Now, we gotta figure out how many tune-ups he needs. His car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. So, we gotta divide 3000 by 1000.

3000 / 1000 = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups."
"So, Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday. Then he works twice that on Wednesday, so that's 10 hours. And on Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, so that's 8 hours.

Let me add 'em up: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"So, Julia and Nadine got the same amount of allowance from their mom. They spent it together on a cake that cost $11. Then they bought balloons. They got 1 dozen balloons, and each 2 balloons cost $0.5. So, 12 balloons cost 6 * $0.5, which is $3. After that, they bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so that's 2 * $7, which is $14.

They spent $11 on the cake, $3 on the balloons, and $14 on the ice cream. That's $11 + $3 + $14, which is $28. They spent all their money, so that's how much they had together.

Now, we gotta figure out how much each of them got. Since they got the same amount, we just divide the total by 2. $28 / 2 is $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"So Kira went to the store and bought some fruit. She got 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. That's a lotta fruit. Then Lola ate 2 of 'em. I wanna know how many are left.

First, I gotta count how many Kira got. I got 3 fingers on one hand, so I count 3 apples. Then I count 5 bananas with the other hand. And I count 6 oranges with my toes. That's a lot of countin'! So, I got 3 + 5 + 6 = 14.

Now, Lola ate 2. I gotta take those away. I got 14, and I take away 2. That's 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"So, there's 6 kids playin' tennis. Then there's twice that many playin' volleyball, so that's 6 * 2 = 12. Now, there's 16 boys and 22 girls playin' soccer, so that's 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 6 + 12 + 38 = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"So, there's this class with 30 students. They sold lollipops, and each lollipop costs 80 cents. They sold 10 lollipops each. They bought the lollipops for 50 cents each. 

First, we gotta figure out how much money they made in total. They sold 10 lollipops each, and there's 30 students. So, that's 10 * 30 = 300 lollipops. Now, each lollipop is 80 cents, so 300 * 80 cents is 240 dollars. That's how much they made.

Now, they bought the lollipops for 50 cents each. They bought 300 lollipops, so that's 300 * 50 cents, which is 150 dollars. That's how much they spent.

Now, to find out how much they made, we gotta subtract the money they spent from the money they made. So, 240 - 150 is 90 dollars.

The final answer is: $90"
"So Larry's got a lot of pets. He's got 3 cats. Then he's got dogs, and he's got 3 times as many dogs as cats, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Now, he's got rabbits, and he's got 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so that's 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Then he's got a fish tank, and he's got 3 times as many fish as rabbits, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

And then there's gerbils, and he's got 1/3 the number of fish, so that's 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

So, let's count 'em all up: 3 cats, 9 dogs, 7 rabbits, 21 fish, and 7 gerbils. That's 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"So, Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as her. That means Josh eats 4 slices a day. Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

Now, we gotta figure out how many days the bread will last. There's 24 slices in the loaf. If they eat 6 slices a day, we divide 24 by 6. That's 24 ÷ 6 = 4.

So, the bread will last 4 days."
"Martha's been collectin' shells since she was 5 years old. She gets one shell every month. So, we gotta figure out how many months she's been collectin' shells. She's 10 now, so she's been collectin' for 5 years. There's 12 months in a year, so we multiply 5 by 12.

5 * 12 = 60

So, Martha's got 60 shells."
"Lana's got 27 cups of tea, and she puts 'em in 3 rows. She makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, and then she uses the rest for cinnamon tea. She makes 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

So, if she's got 27 cups in total and she puts 'em in 3 rows, that means each row's got 27 / 3 = 9 cups. Now, she's got to make equal amounts of mint and chamomile tea in each row. That means each row's got 9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea. But you can't have half a cup, so that don't make no sense.

Let's try again. If each row's got 9 cups, and she's makin' equal amounts of mint and chamomile, that means each row's got 4 or 5 cups of mint tea. If it's 4, then she's got 3 rows with 4 cups each, that's 12 cups of mint tea. If it's 5, then she's got 3 rows with 5 cups each, that's 15 cups of mint tea. And we know she made 15 cups of cinnamon tea, so that must be the right answer.

So, the answer is 5."
"So, the sloth, he's a slow fella, right? He only eats in the tree, and it takes him 4 hours to go down, pick berries, and go back up. He wants to get 24 berries in 8 hours. 

Let's see, if he goes down and back in 4 hours, that means he can only do it 2 times in 8 hours. Now, if he wants 24 berries, and he can only do it 2 times, that means he needs to get 24 / 2 = 12 berries each time.

So, the sloth needs to get 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"
"So, there's a pool with 10000 gallons of water. They take half of that water and put it in a tank. That's 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons. Then they use that water to water their garden. The tank is emptyin' at a rate of 500 gallons a day. We wanna know how much water's left after 6 days.

So, they're emptyin' 500 gallons a day, and they do that for 6 days. That's 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons. Now, we gotta subtract that from the 5000 gallons they put in the tank. 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"Let's figure this out. Colby gets $150 a month to go to the movies. He already spent money on some stuff. He saw 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays, and that cost him 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. He saw 8 movies on other days, and that cost him 8 * 7 = 56 dollars. He also bought 2 tubs of popcorn for 2 * 8 = 16 dollars, and 4 boxes of candy for 4 * 2 = 8 dollars. 

So, he spent 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130 dollars. That means he has 150 - 130 = 20 dollars left.

He wants to see a movie on a Friday, and that costs 10 dollars. So, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday. Now, he has 20 - 10 = 10 dollars left. He can see a movie on other days for 7 dollars, so he can see 10 / 7 = 1.4286. But you can't see a fraction of a movie, so he can see 1 more movie on other days.

So, Colby can see 1 + 1 = 2 movies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"So, Andrew made 200 little cinnamon rolls and 300 little blueberry muffins. I don't know what that means, but I'll try to figure it out. 

A normal cinnamon roll has a lot of calories, like 600. But these are little ones, so they have 1/3 of that, which is 200 calories. He made 200 of those, so that's 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, but these are little ones, so they have 1/3 of that, which is 150 calories. He made 300 of those, so that's 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

So, if you add those two together, you get 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"So, Rita, she's pickin' Junebugs off her plants.  She got 39 on Monday. Then she got twice as many on Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's 78 and 156. Then she got 48 on Thursday and 57 on Friday. 

Let's add 'em all up: 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378. That's the total number of Junebugs she picked.

Now, we gotta find out how many days she did this. She did it for 5 days.

So, we take the total number of Junebugs and divide it by the number of days: 378 / 5 = 75.6

So, the average number of Junebugs she picks per day is 75.6."
"So, the bus goes 60 miles an hour, and it goes for 5 hours. That's 60 * 5, which is 300 miles. 

The car goes 30 miles an hour, and it goes for 8 hours. That's 30 * 8, which is 240 miles.

Now, I gotta figure out how much farther the bus went than the car. I do that by subtractin' the car's distance from the bus's distance. So, 300 - 240 is... 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"So, Sophie's got a bunch of toys for her nephew. There's a bag with 31 blocks, a bin with 8 stuffed animals, and a tower with 9 rings. Then she gets some bouncy balls and now she's got 62 toys in total. I wanna know how many bouncy balls she got.

Let's see... if she had 31 blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 rings, that's 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 toys before she got the bouncy balls. Now she's got 62 toys, so I gotta find out how many bouncy balls she got. I'll just subtract the number of toys she had before from the number of toys she has now.

62 - 48 = 14

So, Sophie got 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's figure this out. We got three people, Peter, Paul, and Jean. They're all old, and together they're 100 years old. Now, Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is the same as Paul and Jean's ages added together.

Let's say Jean's age is J. Then Paul's age is J + 10. And Peter's age is J + (J + 10), 'cause that's what we're told.

So, we got J + (J + 10) + (J + 10) = 100. That's like, J + J + 10 + J + 10 = 100. Now, we can add all them J's together: 3J + 20 = 100.

Now, we gotta get rid of the 20. We can do that by subtracting 20 from both sides: 3J = 80. Now, we gotta get J by itself. We can do that by dividing both sides by 3: J = 80/3.

Now, I'm not really sure what that means, but I think it's like 26 and some change. So, Jean's age is like 26.67. Now, we can find Paul's age by adding 10 to that: Paul's age is 36.67.

Now, we can find Peter's age by adding Jean's age to Paul's age: Peter's age is 36.67 + 26.67.

The final answer is: 63.34"
"So, Maria had a water balloon fight with her friends. She gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. That's 4 * 2 = 8 balloons. Then she had 1 for herself, so that's 9 balloons.

Then Maria's mom comes out and gives each of them 3 more balloons. That's 5 people, so 5 * 3 = 15 more balloons. Now we gotta add that to the 9 balloons they already had. 9 + 15 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"So they got 10 people and each one gave 5 boxes of stuff. That's 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. They already had 10 boxes, so now they got 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can put 2 boxes on a table, so they need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already got 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"So Zoey and Sydney are havin' a contest to see who can spit watermelon seeds the farthest. Zoey's got a watermelon with 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. Sydney's got a watermelon with 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet. We wanna know the average distance they spat seeds.

First, we gotta find out how far each of 'em spat seeds in total. Zoey spits 40 seeds * 10 feet each, that's 400 feet. Sydney spits 35 seeds * 12 feet each, that's 420 feet.

Now we add 'em together, 400 + 420 = 820 feet. That's the total distance they spat seeds.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

Now we gotta find the average distance. We do that by dividin' the total distance by the total number of seeds. 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

The final answer is: 10.93"
"So, Fern is tryin' to decide between two machines, the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. Each widget sells for 6 bucks.

Let's see how much money they make in a month. There's 24 hours in a day, and 30 days in a month. So, we gotta multiply the number of widgets each machine makes per hour by 24 and then by 30.

For the Widgeteer 3000, that's 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets. And for the WidgetMaster 9000, that's 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, we gotta multiply the number of widgets by the price of each widget, which is 6 bucks. So, the Widgeteer 3000 makes 43,200 * 6 = 259,200 bucks. And the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32,400 * 6 = 194,400 bucks.

Now, we gotta find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes than the WidgetMaster 9000. That's 259,200 - 194,400 = 64,800 bucks.

The hotel costs 1000 pesos for 12 hours, and then 70 pesos for every hour after that. So, Cameron pays 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours, and then 70 pesos for the 5 extra hours. That's 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The hotel also costs 1600 pesos for 24 hours. To find out how much Cameron saves, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the extra hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: 250"
"So, Nate's got some goats and sheep, and he's buyin' hay for 'em. Each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 7 pounds 'cause it's 3 pounds less than twice what the goat needs. 

There's 15 goats, so that's 15 * 5 = 75 pounds for the goats. And there's 12 sheep, so that's 12 * 7 = 84 pounds for the sheep. 

So, Nate needs 75 + 84 pounds of hay. That's 159 pounds."
"So John makes 50 bucks an hour and he works 6 hours a week. That's 50 * 6 = 300 bucks. Then he spends 50 bucks on gas. That's 300 - 50 = 250 bucks left. He wants to put 100 bucks in the bank, so he's got 250 - 100 = 150 bucks left.

Now, he buys 5 pencils for 10 bucks each. That's 5 * 10 = 50 bucks. So he's got 150 - 50 = 100 bucks left.

Now, he wants to know how many 25 buck pens he can buy. That's 100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"So, Craig and his brother, they're playin' this game where they take turns sayin' words and countin' the letters. They do this for ten rounds. Craig says 20 words, and each word has 15 letters. That's a lot of letters.

To find out how many letters Craig said, I just multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. That's 20 * 15 = 300. So, Craig said 300 letters.

Now, Craig's brother said some words too, and he said 50 more letters than Craig. That's 350 letters. 

So, if we add the letters Craig said and the letters his brother said, we get 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: 650"
"So, there's a big drill with kids, and they're standin' in rows. There's 8 kids in each row, and there's 7 rows. But that's not all, there's 5 different schools doin' this drill. I gotta figure out how many kids there is in total.

Let me see... if there's 8 kids in each row, and there's 7 rows, that's 8 * 7. That's 56 kids. But wait, there's 5 schools doin' this drill, so I gotta multiply that by 5. That's 56 * 5. That's... 280.

The final answer is: 280"
"So, there's a teacher with 29 kids in her class. She's got 9 coupons, and each coupon gets her 100 bottles of apple juice. She gives each kid 2 bottles of apple juice. 

First, we gotta figure out how many bottles she gives to the kids. There's 29 kids, and each one gets 2 bottles. That's 29 * 2, which is 58 bottles.

Now, we gotta find out how many bottles she gets from her coupons. She's got 9 coupons, and each one gets her 100 bottles. That's 9 * 100, which is 900 bottles.

Now, we gotta subtract the bottles she gave to the kids from the bottles she got. That's 900 - 58, which is... 842.

The final answer is: 842"
"So, you wanna know how much Patty charged for fixin' that pipe, huh? Alright, let's break it down. She charges $40 just to show up, then $35 an hour for workin', and she also gotta buy parts. 

She worked for 2 hours and 15 minutes, so that's 2.25 hours. Multiply that by $35, and you get $78.75. Then, she bought $60 worth of parts. Add that to the visit fee, which is $40, and you get... 

$78.75 + $60 + $40 = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"So James gets 10 CDs, and they cost 15 bucks each. He gets 'em for 40% off, which means he don't gotta pay the whole 15 bucks. 

First, I gotta find out how much he paid for the CDs. 10 CDs times 15 bucks is 150 bucks. Then I gotta find 40% of that, which is like, 40% of 150. That's like, 0.4 times 150, which is 60 bucks. So he saved 60 bucks.

Now, he paid 150 - 60 = 90 bucks for the CDs. Then he sells 5 of 'em for 40 bucks each. That's 5 times 40, which is 200 bucks. So he made 200 bucks.

But, he only paid 90 bucks, so he made a profit of 200 - 90 = 110 bucks. I think that means he didn't lose no money, he made money. So, he wasn't out no money.

The final answer is: $110"
"Jen's got some root crops she wanna sell. She got 6 yams, and they cost 1.5 bucks each. She got 10 sweet potatoes, and they cost 2 bucks each. And she got 4 carrots, and they cost 1.25 bucks each. 

Let's see how much she'll get if she sells all of 'em. She'll get 6 * 1.5 for the yams, that's 9 bucks. Then she'll get 10 * 2 for the sweet potatoes, that's 20 bucks. And she'll get 4 * 1.25 for the carrots, that's 5 bucks.

Now, let's add 'em all up. 9 + 20 + 5 is 34 bucks.

The final answer is: $34"
"So James wants to swim across a lake that's 20 miles wide. He swims pretty fast, 2 miles an hour. He swims 60% of the lake, which is 12 miles. That's a lot of swimming. It took him 6 hours to swim that far, 'cause 12 miles divided by 2 miles an hour is 6 hours.

Then he stops on an island and rests for 3 hours. That's half of 6 hours, 'cause if you divide 6 by 2, you get 3.

Now, he's got 8 miles left to swim, 'cause 20 miles minus 12 miles is 8 miles. But he's swimmin' slower now, only 1 mile an hour. That's half of 2 miles an hour, 'cause if you divide 2 by 2, you get 1. So it took him 8 hours to swim the last 8 miles, 'cause 8 miles divided by 1 mile an hour is 8 hours.

So, let's add up all the time: 6 hours for swimmin', 3 hours for restin', and 8 hours for swimmin' again. That's 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"So, the bakery has a lot of bread. Sam had 70 loaves last Friday. Now, we gotta figure out how many the bakery has. We gotta multiply 70 by 7, 'cause it says seven times as many. That's 7 * 70 = 490.

Now, we gotta take away 40 from that. That's 490 - 40 = 450.

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"So, Jasmine gets 15 stickers for bein' good in class. Then she loses 7 stickers playin' around. That's like, 15 minus 7. That's 8 stickers. Then her teacher gives her 5 more stickers for helpin' her friends. So, we gotta add 5 to 8. That's 13 stickers."
"So, Cayley sells newspapers and he gets a commission. He gets 10% on the New York Times and 8% on the Wall Street Journal. He sells 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal. The New York Times costs $5 and the Wall Street Journal costs $15.

First, let's figure out how much commission he gets from the New York Times. He sells 6 copies, and each one costs $5. So, that's 6 * 5 = 30 dollars. Now, he gets 10% of that, which is 30 * 0.1 = 3 dollars.

Now, let's do the same thing for the Wall Street Journal. He sells 10 copies, and each one costs $15. So, that's 10 * 15 = 150 dollars. Now, he gets 8% of that, which is 150 * 0.08 = 12 dollars.

Now, we add the two commissions together. 3 + 12 = 15 dollars.

The final answer is: $15"
"So, Deanna is 26 years old. That's what we know. Now, Marcus is younger than Deanna by 5 years. So, we gotta subtract 5 from 26 to find out how old Marcus is. That's 26 - 5 = 21.

Now, Marcus is half as old as Leo. That means Leo is twice as old as Marcus. We gotta multiply 21 by 2 to find out how old Leo is. That's 21 * 2 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"So, Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar got 45 points together. Bahati got the most points. He got 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. 

Let's say Azibo got A points. Then Bahati got A + 20 points and Dinar got A - 10 points. 

We know that A + (A + 20) + (A - 10) = 45. 

We can add the points together: 3A + 10 = 45. 

Now, we can subtract 10 from both sides: 3A = 35. 

We can divide both sides by 3: A = 35 / 3. 

A = 11.67."
"So, the book is 1.5 inches thick, and it's printed on paper that's 100 pages to the inch. But, each page is on both sides, so that's like, 2 pages per piece of paper. 

So, if we got 100 pages per inch, and each one's on both sides, that's 200 pages per inch. Now, we gotta multiply that by how thick the book is, which is 1.5 inches. 

200 pages per inch times 1.5 inches is... 300 pages. 

The final answer is: 300"
"So, Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. He works from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. That's a whole lotta time. Let's figure out how many minutes that is. There's 60 minutes in an hour, and he works for 15 hours. So, that's 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Now, we gotta find out how many groups of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes. That's easy, just divide 900 by 15. 900 / 15 = 60. So, there's 60 groups of 15 minutes.

Now, Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. So, if there's 60 groups of 15 minutes, he staples 30 * 60 reports. That's 1800 reports.

The final answer is: 1800"
"So, Kim goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. That's 8 hours. But she woke up 5 minutes early, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. 

She was sleepwalkin' from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. That's 23 minutes. We gotta take that away from her total sleep time. 

First, we gotta figure out how many minutes she slept. 8 hours is 8 * 60, that's 480 minutes. Then we take away the 23 minutes she was sleepwalkin', so it's 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

The final answer is: 457"
"Jonathan got 2 dozen cups, that's 24 cups. Now, he got 2/3 as many spoons as cups. That means he got 2/3 of 24, which is 16 spoons. Then he gave 6 spoons to Pedro. So, he's got 16 - 6 = 10 spoons left. Now, we gotta count all the utensils he's got left. He's got 24 cups and 10 spoons, so that's 24 + 10 = 34 utensils.

The final answer is: 34"
"So, the hospital got 1000 beds, and 1/5 of 'em is already taken. That's like, 100 beds. Now, we gotta figure out how many are free. If 1/5 is taken, that means 4/5 is free. So, 4/5 of 1000 is... um... 800 beds free.

Now, there's this coronavirus thingy, and 50 people come in every day. That's a lotta people. In 2 weeks, that's 14 days, so 50 * 14 is... *counts on fingers* ...700 people. So, now we got 100 people already in the hospital, and 700 more come in, that's 800 people in total.

Now, we gotta find out how many beds are free. We got 1000 beds, and 800 people are in 'em. So, 1000 - 800 is... *counts on fingers again* ...200 beds free.

The final answer is: 200"
"So, Robyn sends 16 emails a day. 7 of 'em are work emails. That leaves 16 - 7 = 9 emails that ain't work. Now, 2 out of 3 of them are to her family, so that's 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails to family. That means the other 3 emails ain't to family. Now, 1 out of 3 of them are to her boyfriend, so that's 1/3 * 3 = 1 email to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"So, Shawna's dad is older than her. And Shawna is older than Aliya. Aliya is 3 years old. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Now, Shawna's dad is five times as old as Shawna. That means we gotta multiply 9 by 5. 9 * 5 = 45.

So, Shawna's dad is 45 years old."
"So, Courtney said there was 48 people at the concert, but Kelly said she made a mistake and it was more like 20% less. That means we gotta take 20% of 48 and subtract it from 48.

20% of 48 is like, um, 48 times 0.2, that's 9.6. Now we gotta take that away from 48.

48 - 9.6 is 38.4. So, there was 38.4 people at the concert.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"So, there's this coach, and he's got a bunch of basketballs. He asks Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick 'em up. Now, Jordan carries twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carries twice as many as Jeffrey. We know Jason carried 2 balls.

Let's say Jeffrey carried x balls. That means Jason carried 2x balls, and Jordan carried 4x balls. They all carried 'em in one trip, so the total number of balls is x + 2x + 4x. That's 7x.

Now, we know Jason carried 2 balls, so 2x = 2. That means x = 1. Now we gotta find the total number of balls. We got 7x, and x is 1, so 7x is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"So, the pirates dug some holes, right? They dug 10 holes the first day. Then they dug 13 holes the next day. After that, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, 'cause they kept fallin' in. 

So, let's count the holes. They had 10 holes the first day. Then they added 13 more, so that's 23 holes. Then they dug 8 more and filled in 2, so that's 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

Now, the island had four times as many holes as it did the first day. And the first day they had 10 holes. So, four times 10 is 40 holes. That's how many holes they had by the end of the fourth day.

So, if they had 40 holes by the end of the fourth day and they already had 29 holes, that means they dug 40 - 29 = 11 holes on the fourth day.

The final answer is: 11"
"So, Amora, Lainey, and Collins wanna share corn chips. But it turns out, only two of 'em get the same amount, and the other one gets 15 more. And we know Amora and Lainey got 70 each.

So, if Amora and Lainey got 70 each, that means Collins got 70 + 15, which is 85. Now, we gotta find out how many corn chips they had altogether.

Let's see, Amora and Lainey got 70 each, so that's 2 x 70 = 140. And Collins got 85. So, if we add 'em all up, we get 140 + 85 = 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"So Jen's goin' to 3 different countries, right? He gotta pay $400 for stuff he needs. Now, the tickets for travel cost more than that. It's like, 50% more. That means he gotta pay 50% of $400, and then add it to $400.

50% of $400 is like half of $400, so that's $200. Now, we add that to $400: $400 + $200 = $600.

So, the travel cost $600."
"Let's figure this out. We got three guys, Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe, and they caught 339 Pokémon together. Now, Alex caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe.

Let's say Adelwolfe caught A Pokémon, Stan caught S, and Alex caught L. We know that A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex caught 5 more than Stan, so L = S + 5.

And Stan caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can plug the second one into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can plug the third one into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.
9A - 21 = 339.

Now we can add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Now we can divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

So, Stan caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"So, John's watchin' this show, and each episode is 20 minutes long. Now, I'm thinkin', if there's half as many episodes as there is minutes in one episode, that means there's 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

Now, if he watches all 10 episodes, and each one's 20 minutes long, I reckon he'll watch for 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"So the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles an hour. That's 30 * 10 = 300 miles. Then it flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles an hour. That's 18 * 2 = 36 miles. Then it flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles an hour. That's 22 * 5 = 110 miles.

Now, the bird flew 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, so it's still 300 - 36 = 264 miles south. Then it flew another 110 miles south. So the total distance it flew south is 264 + 110 = 374 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"So Greta wanted brownies for her birthday. She made some for herself, and then she got some from her office, and then she got some from her friends. Then some got eaten. I gotta figure out how many she got left.

She made 12 brownies for herself. Then she got 6 from her office. And then she got 48 from her friends. That's 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then some got eaten. 1 1/2 dozen got eaten. That's 18 brownies.

So, to find out how many she got left, I gotta subtract the ones that got eaten from the ones she got. That's 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"So, Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 16 years old. 

Now, Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. That means she's 75% of his age. To find 75% of 8, I'll just think about it... 8 is like 8 cookies, and 75% is like 6 cookies. So, Nani's sister is 6 years old.

Now, let's add up their ages: Nani is 8, his brother is 16, and his sister is 6. That's 8 + 16 + 6 = 30.

"So, Andy's got 12 racquets to string. Some need synthetic gut, some need polyester, and some need a mix of both. He's got 3 racquets for synthetic gut, 5 for polyester, and 4 for the mix.

It takes him 15 minutes for synthetic gut, 22 minutes for polyester, and 18 minutes for the mix. 

Let's figure out how long it takes for each one. For synthetic gut, that's 3 racquets * 15 minutes = 45 minutes. For polyester, that's 5 racquets * 22 minutes = 110 minutes. And for the mix, that's 4 racquets * 18 minutes = 72 minutes.

Now, we add 'em all up: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"So John wants to buy phones for him, his 2 kids, and his wife. He's gonna buy 4 phones in total. The first 2 phones cost $600 each, so that's 2 * $600 = $1200. 

Now, the other 2 phones are cheaper, they're half price. So each one is $600 / 2 = $300. That's 2 * $300 = $600 for the other 2 phones.

So, in total, John paid $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"

The final answer is: 33"
"So, Robert's got a garden and he's buildin' a fence 'round it. The fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. He needs 2 slats for every foot of fence. 

First, we gotta figure out how much fence he's gonna need. We gotta add the length and the width together, then multiply it by 2. That's 'cause the fence's got four sides, right? Two long sides and two short sides.

So, 15 + 10 is 25. Then we multiply that by 2. 25 * 2 is 50. That's how many feet of fence he needs.

Now, we gotta figure out how many slats he needs. He needs 2 slats for every foot of fence. So, we multiply 50 by 2. That's 100 slats.

The final answer is: 100"
"So, Mrs. Harrington got 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. That's 4 boxes gone. Now she's got 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

Each box has 20 oranges, so 8 boxes got 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges. That's 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

Now, she sold the rest. That's 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

So, the USA has a lot of states, I think it's 50. I'm pretty sure about that. 

Now, India has some states too. I heard it's more than half of the USA's states. Half of 50 is 25, and if you add 4 to that, it's 29. So, India has 29 states.

If you add the states of the USA and India together, it's 50 + 29 = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"So Tyler wants to buy some books. He's got a dictionary that's $18, a dinosaur book that's $13, and a cookbook that's $8. He's already got $14 from his allowance. He earns $5 an hour. How many hours does he gotta work to get the rest of the money?

First, we gotta find out how much more money he needs. We add up the cost of the books: $18 + $13 + $8 = $39. Then we subtract the money he's already got: $39 - $14 = $25. So he needs $25 more.

Now, we gotta figure out how many hours he needs to work to get that $25. We do that by dividing the money he needs ($25) by how much he earns an hour ($5). $25 / $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"So, Robert's got 30 cherries, and he's got 10 more than Richard. That means Richard's got 30 - 10 = 20 cherries. Now, we gotta figure out how many cherries Jerry's got. We know Robert and Richard got 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together. If they got 50, and there's 60 cherries in total, then Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Now, we gotta find out how many more cherries Robert's got than Jerry. Robert's got 30, and Jerry's got 10. So, Robert's got 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"So, Sunny's sellin' gingerbread and apple pie. He sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday. He sold 4 less boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Let's figure out how many boxes of apple pie he sold on Saturday. If he sold 15 on Sunday, and 4 less on Saturday, that means he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, let's find out how much money he made on Saturday. He sold 10 boxes of gingerbread for 6 bucks each, so that's 10 * 6 = 60 bucks. He sold 11 boxes of apple pie for 15 bucks each, so that's 11 * 15 = 165 bucks. That's a total of 60 + 165 = 225 bucks on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread for 6 bucks each, so that's 15 * 6 = 90 bucks. He sold 15 boxes of apple pie for 15 bucks each, so that's 15 * 15 = 225 bucks. That's a total of 90 + 225 = 315 bucks on Sunday.

So, in total, Sunny made 225 + 315 = 540 bucks.

"So, Pamela's gonna be outside a lot, and she needs sunscreen. She uses a whole ounce every hour, and she's gonna be outside 4 hours a day. That's 4 ounces a day. 

She's gonna be outside for 8 days, so she's gonna use 4 ounces a day for 8 days. That's 4 * 8 = 32 ounces. 

Now, she gets sunscreen in bottles that are 8 ounces each. So, we gotta figure out how many bottles she needs. We take the total amount of sunscreen she needs (32 ounces) and divide it by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces). 

32 / 8 = 4

So, she needs 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"So, the blue car costs a hundred bucks. And the red car is cheaper, 40% cheaper. That means it's 60% of the price of the blue car. 

60% of a hundred is 60. So the red car costs 60 bucks.

Now, if the blue car is a hundred and the red car is 60, how much do they cost together? You just add 'em up. 

$100 + $60 = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"So, Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he's gonna be half the age of his dad. That means his dad is gonna be 24 * 2 = 48 years old when Emil turns 24. 

Now, we gotta figure out how old Emil's dad is now. Emil is 19 now, so in 5 years, he'll be 24. That means his dad is 48 - 5 = 43 years old now.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, his brother will be half his age. That means his brother is 24 / 2 = 12 years old when Emil turns 24. So, his brother is 12 - 5 = 7 years old now.

Now, we gotta add up the ages of Emil's dad and brother. 43 + 7 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"So, let's figure this out. Adrianne's mom gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more than her mom, so that's 30 beads. And her friend gave her twice as many as her mom, so that's 40 beads.

Now, let's add 'em up: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"So, Joe caught some crawfish.  He got 3 pounds on Thursday. Then he got 4 times that on Friday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. Then he got half of that on Saturday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up all the crawfish he got: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we gotta divide the total by 3 to get the servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"So, there's a class with 30 students. 20% of 'em are football players. That's like, 6 kids. 

Now, we gotta find out how many of the other kids are cheerleaders or in the band. There's 30 kids total, minus the 6 football players, that's 24 kids left. 

Now, 25% of those 24 kids are cheerleaders or in the band. That's like, 6 kids. 

So, we gotta add the football players and the cheerleaders or band kids together. That's 6 + 6 = 12 kids. 

The final answer is: 12"
"So, Sophie's boots are size 5, right? And Charlie's boots are five times bigger than hers. That means Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25. 

Now, we gotta find the average. We add 'em up, 5 + 25 = 30. Then we divide by 2, 'cause there's two of 'em. 30 / 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, Pat's got a flower bed that's 111 feet long. She wants to put plants in it, but they gotta be 12 inches apart, and she's got 17 plants already. Each plant costs 6 bucks.

First, we gotta figure out how many plants she can fit. We gotta convert the length of the flower bed to inches, 'cause the plants are in inches. 111 feet is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Now, we gotta subtract the space between the plants. There's 18 inches between each plant, so we gotta subtract 18n (where n is the number of plants) from 1332. We also gotta subtract the width of the plant itself, which is 12 inches. So, we got 1332 - 18n - 12n = 1320 - 30n.

We know Pat's got 17 plants, so she needs to buy n - 17 more. The cost of each plant is 6 bucks, so the total cost is (n - 17) * 6.

Now, we gotta figure out how many plants she can fit. We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for n plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

Let's solve for n. We can add 30n to both sides: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. We can't have a fraction of a plant, so we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"So, Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats half that. That's like, 18 divided by 2. That's 9 pretzels a day for his brother.

Now, we gotta figure out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. There's 7 days in a week, so we multiply 9 by 7.

9 * 7 = 63

The final answer is: 63"
"So Katherine's got 5 baskets and she wants to put 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines in each one. Petunias cost 3 bucks each and sweet potato vines cost 2.50 bucks each. 

First, let's figure out how much the petunias cost. She's got 5 baskets and each basket's gonna have 3 petunias. That's 5 x 3 = 15 petunias. And each petunia's 3 bucks, so that's 15 x 3 = 45 bucks for the petunias.

Now, let's do the sweet potato vines. She's got 5 baskets and each basket's gonna have 2 vines. That's 5 x 2 = 10 vines. And each vine's 2.50 bucks, so that's 10 x 2.50 = 25 bucks for the vines.

So, in total, Katherine's gonna spend 45 + 25 = 70 bucks."
"So, Artemis and her dad got a big ol' bag of soil, 30 pounds. They're gonna plant some flowers. Roses need 1 pound each, carnations need 1.5 pounds each, and sunflowers need 3 pounds each. They're plantin' 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations.

First, let's figure out how much soil them sunflowers and carnations need. 4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 pounds, that's 12 pounds. And 10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 pounds, that's 15 pounds. So, that's 12 + 15, that's 27 pounds.

Now, we gotta see how much soil's left for the roses. They got 30 pounds total, and they used 27 pounds for the sunflowers and carnations. So, that's 30 - 27, that's 3 pounds left.

Now, we know roses need 1 pound each. So, they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: 3"
"So, Jessica makes 2,000 bucks a month. She puts 25% of that away for shoes. That's like, a quarter of 2,000. So, 25% of 2,000 is 500 bucks. 

Now, she saves 500 bucks a month. There's 12 months in a year, right? So, she saves 500 * 12, that's 6,000 bucks a year.

Each pair of shoes is 1,000 bucks. So, if she saves 6,000 bucks a year, she can buy 6,000 / 1,000 = 6 pairs of shoes.

The final answer is: 6"
"So, Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, that's like, a lot. And she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, that's even more. Now, we gotta figure out how long it takes her to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

First, let's think about peeling. If she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, that means she can peel 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, and 90 shrimp in 15 minutes. Yeah, it's gonna take her 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.

Now, let's think about cooking. If she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, that means she can cook 90 shrimp in 30 minutes. But, we gotta remember, she's peeling and cooking at the same time.

So, it's gonna take her 30 minutes to cook 90 shrimp, and she's peeling them at the same time. That's the same amount of time it takes her to cook them, so it's gotta be 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"So, the air conditioner cools the room down. It cools it down 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. But if it's not on, it warms up 2 degrees an hour. 

It was on low for 3 hours, so it cooled it down 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. Then it was on high for 4 hours, so it cooled it down 4 * 3 = 12 degrees. That's a total of 6 + 12 = 18 degrees it cooled it down.

But then it was off for 2 hours, and it warmed up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees. So, it warmed up 4 degrees. 

So, it cooled it down 18 degrees, but then it warmed up 4 degrees. That's 18 - 4 = 14 degrees. 

The final answer is: 14"
"So, let's figure this out. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Then, Bill saw it when he was three times that age. Three times 30 is 90. So, Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.

Now, we gotta figure out how long it takes for the comet to come back. It's 75 years. That means Bill's dad was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when Bill was born.

If Bill's dad was 30 when he saw the comet, and he was 15 when Bill was born, that means Bill was 30 - 15 = 15 years old when his dad was born.

But we want to know how old Bill was when he saw the comet the first time. We know he was 15 when his dad was born, and his dad was 30 when he saw the comet. So, Bill was 15 when his dad was 30, which means Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet the first time.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, Buford writes checks for a lot of stuff. He writes one check a month for his electric bill, and another one for his gas bill. He also writes two checks a month to the church. And then he writes a check every three months to the pest and lawn people.

Let's count 'em up. He writes 12 checks for the electric and 12 for the gas. That's 24 checks right there. Then he writes 2 checks a month to the church, so that's 24 checks too. And he writes 4 checks a year to the pest and lawn people.

Now, let's add 'em all up. 24 + 24 + 4 = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"So, there's this airport with two planes. One plane goes to Greece for most of its trips, and the rest it splits between France and Germany. The other plane just goes to Poland, but it only goes 44 times a day. That's half of what the other plane goes. 

Let's figure out how many times the first plane goes. If the second plane goes 44 times, and that's half of the first plane, then the first plane must go 88 times. 

Now, the first plane goes to Greece for 3 out of 4 of its trips. That's 66 trips. So, it's left with 88 - 66 = 22 trips. And it splits those 22 trips between France and Germany. That means it goes to France 11 times.

The final answer is: 11"
"So, there's these three wolves, Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous. They all howl at the moon. Now, Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so that's 40 seconds. And Igneous howls for as long as the other two combined, which is 20 + 40, that's 60 seconds.

Now, I gotta add 'em all up: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. But I need to change that to minutes, 'cause that's what the question's askin' for. There's 60 seconds in a minute, so I gotta divide 120 by 60. That's 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"So Adam bought some new trousers for 30 bucks. His mom gave him 6 dollars, and his dad gave him twice as much as his mom. That's 2 times 6, which is 12 dollars. So his dad gave him 12 dollars.

Now, let's add up how much his parents gave him. 6 dollars from his mom and 12 dollars from his dad, that's 18 dollars total.

So, if the trousers cost 30 dollars and his parents gave him 18 dollars, he must have had to give 30 - 18 = 12 dollars from his own pocket.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's figure this out. We got four kids, right? Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. We also know that the total age of all four kids is 20.

So, if we add up Akbar and Alessandro's ages, we get 3 + 4 = 7. That means the other two kids, Helene and Wilfred, must be 20 - 7 = 13 years old in total.

Now, we're told that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. That means if we take the total age of the group (20) and divide it by the number of kids (4), we get the average age. The average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene must be 2 * 5 = 10 years old.

Now we know Helene is 10 and the total age of Helene and Wilfred is 13. So, Wilfred must be 13 - 10 = 3 years old.

The final answer is: 3"
"So Walter's got some money from his neighbors, $500. Then he gets $1500 from some online thingy. Now, his lawyer is gonna give him some cash too. But here's the thing, the lawyer is gonna give him three times as much as everyone else gave him. Now, Walter's friend gives him $200, but that don't count for the lawyer's donation. The lawyer only cares about the money from the neighbors and the online thing.

So, we gotta add the money from the neighbors and the online thing. That's $500 + $1500 = $2000. Now, the lawyer is gonna give him three times that, so it's 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"So, there was a wedding and 100 people came to the reception. Each one of 'em brought 15 cookies. That's a lotta cookies. The bride, she decided to give half of 'em to the church next door. I guess they helped out with the wedding or somethin'.

So, if there's 100 people and each one brought 15 cookies, that's 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies. Now, the bride gives half of 'em away, so that's 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Now, I'm thinkin', if each person in the church got 15 cookies, how many people were there? That's easy, just divide the cookies by the number each person got. 750 / 15 = 50.

So, there's 50 people in the church.

The final answer is: 50"
"So, you got a big ol' watermelon and you wanna know how much of it the grown-ups get if they get twice as much as the kids. Alright, let's say the watermelon is 100 pieces. Now, the kids get some of it, and the grown-ups get some too. 

Let's say each kid gets x pieces. That means the grown-ups get 2x pieces each, 'cause they get twice as much. There's 4 kids, so they get 4x pieces in total. And there's 2 grown-ups, so they get 2 * 2x = 4x pieces in total.

Now, we know the total watermelon is 100 pieces, so we can say: 4x + 4x = 100. That's like, the kids' pieces plus the grown-ups' pieces equals the whole watermelon.

We can simplify that to 8x = 100. Now, we gotta find out what x is. We do that by dividin' 100 by 8. That's 100 / 8 = 12.5. So each kid gets 12.5 pieces.

Now, we know the grown-ups get twice as much, so each grown-up gets 2 * 12.5 = 25 pieces.

To find out what percent of the watermelon the grown-ups get, we take the grown-ups' pieces and divide by the total watermelon, then multiply by 100. That's 25 / 100 * 100 = 25%.

So, the grown-ups get 25% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 25"
"So Doctor Jones is workin' at the clinic on Monday. He's there for 9 hours. He's gotta check on some people who are stayin' there, and he's got some appointments too. He's gotta check on 9 people, and that takes 20 minutes each. He's got 10 appointments, and each one takes 30 minutes.

First, let's figure out how long it takes him to check on all them people. 9 people * 20 minutes = 180 minutes. That's a lot of time. Now, let's figure out how long the appointments take. 10 appointments * 30 minutes = 300 minutes. That's a whole lotta time too.

Now we gotta add 'em together. 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes. That's how long he's spendin' on rounds and appointments. Now we gotta convert that to hours. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so... 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

So he's spendin' 8 hours on rounds and appointments. He's workin' 9 hours, so... 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour. That's how much time he's got left to update his records."
"So, Jordan wanna make a cake for her mom's birthday. She gotta make the batter, bake it, let it cool, and then frost it. 

First, she gotta make the batter, that takes 20 minutes. Then she gotta put it in the oven, that takes 30 minutes. After that, she gotta let it cool for 2 hours. And finally, she gotta frost it, that takes 10 minutes.

So, let's add all that up. 20 minutes for the batter, 30 minutes for baking, 2 hours for cooling, and 10 minutes for frosting. That's a lot of time. 

2 hours is 120 minutes, so we gotta add that to the other times. 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes. That's how long it takes to make the cake.

Now, we gotta figure out what time she should start makin' the cake so it's ready by 5:00 pm. We gotta subtract the time it takes to make the cake from 5:00 pm. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm. So, Jordan should start makin' the cake at 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"So, Lisa and Peter sold chocolate bars. Lisa sold 3 and a half boxes, and Peter sold 4 and a half boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. I gotta figure out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

Let's see... If Lisa sold 3 and a half boxes, that's like 3 boxes and some extra. And Peter sold 4 and a half boxes, that's like 4 boxes and some extra. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. So, if we add the boxes they sold, it's like 3 and a half plus 4 and a half. That's 8 boxes. But they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we gotta figure out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

Let's say there's x chocolate bars in a box. Then Lisa sold 3 and a half x, and Peter sold 4 and a half x. Together, they sold 3 and a half x plus 4 and a half x, which is 8x. We know they sold 64 chocolate bars, so 8x = 64.

Now, I gotta figure out what x is. I think I can do that by dividing 64 by 8. That's like sharing 64 cookies with 8 people. Each person gets 8 cookies. So, 64 divided by 8 is 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"So, the dance studio gets $25 to rent the place, and then it's $1.50 for each kid that comes. They got 10 kids, so that's 10 * $1.50 = $15. So, it's $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

They rent it out 3 times a week, and there's 4 weeks in a month. That's 3 * 4 = 12 times a month. So, they get $40 * 12 = $480 a month.

The final answer is: $480"
"So, Peter's got 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and Martha's got 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each. Peter's got a total of 64 chocolate bars, and Martha's got 56. 

Let's figure out how many chocolate bars are in each box. If Peter's got 64 chocolate bars and 4 boxes, then we divide 64 by 4. That's 16 chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes. 

Now, let's do the same for Martha. If she's got 56 chocolate bars and 7 boxes, then we divide 56 by 7. That's 8 chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes.

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter's got in each box than Martha. We take the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box, which is 16, and subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box, which is 8. That's 16 - 8, which is 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"So, there's 50 porcupines in the park. Now, 3 out of 5 of 'em are females. That's like, 3/5 of 50. Let me count on my fingers... 3/5 of 50 is... 30 females.

Now, each female porcupine has 4 babies a month. That's a lotta babies! There's 12 months in a year, so that's 4 * 12 = 48 babies.

Now, we gotta add the babies to the original 50. So, 50 + 48 is... 98. That's how many porcupines there'll be in the park after a year.

The final answer is: 98"
"So, Mr. Smith needs to know how much it's gonna cost to fill his pool. He measured it and it's 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. To find out how much water he needs, we gotta multiply those numbers together.

Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Now, the pool company says we gotta multiply that by 5.9 to get the gallons of water.

Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we gotta find out how much it's gonna cost. The pool company charges 10 cents per gallon. So, we multiply the gallons by 10 cents.

Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

So, it's gonna cost Mr. Smith $826 to fill his pool."
"So, there's 9 red sticks. Then there's 5 more blue sticks than red, so that's 14 blue sticks. Now, the yellow sticks, they got 3 less than the blue ones, so that's 11 yellow sticks.

"So, let's figure this out. We got two guys, Matteo and Shandy. Matteo went 55 miles an hour for 4 hours. That's 55 * 4, which is 220 miles. Then we got Shandy, he went 45 miles an hour for 10 hours. That's 45 * 10, which is 450 miles.

Now, we wanna know how much farther Shandy drove than Matteo. So, we take Shandy's miles and subtract Matteo's miles. That's 450 - 220, which is 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"So, let's figure this out. We got 3000 students in total. Half of 'em are over 16, so that's 1500. Now, half of them are boys, so that's 375 boys. That means 1125 are girls. 

Now, we got the other half, which is 1500, that's the ones under 16. Half of 'em are boys too, so that's 750. That means 750 are girls. 

Now, we add the girls together, 1125 + 750, that's 1875. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"So, let's figure this out. Bethany can run 10 laps in an hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps. 

Now, Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey. That's 14 / 2, which is 7 laps. 

And then there's Quinn. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we gotta find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

"So, there's this tank that's 18000 gallons big. Wanda and Ms. B are tryin' to fill it up from a pond. On the first day, Wanda puts in 1/4 of the tank, which is 4500 gallons. Then Ms. B puts in 3/4 of what Wanda put in, which is 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda puts in 2/3 of what she put in the first day, which is 3000 gallons. Ms. B puts in 1/3 of what she put in the first day, which is 1125 gallons.

So, if we add all that up, Wanda and Ms. B put in 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. That's how much water they got in the tank.

Now, to find out how much water is left, we gotta subtract that from the tank's capacity. 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"So, Maria's power bank wasn't full when she went to the park. She charged it for a bit, then her friends asked to use it. While charging their phones, she saw it was losing charge. It was losing 9% every hour for 5 hours. Then it started losing 7% every hour for 3 hours. When it was all done, it was at 28% charge.

Let's figure this out. If it was losing 9% every hour for 5 hours, that's 45% gone. So, after 5 hours, it had 55% left.

Then it started losing 7% every hour for 3 hours. That's 21% gone. So, after 8 hours, it had 34% left.

But we know it ended up with 28% left. That means it lost 6% in the last 3 hours. We know it had 34% left after 8 hours, so it must have had 40% left after 5 hours. That's because 34% - 6% = 28%.

Now, we know it had 40% left after 5 hours. That means it lost 15% in the first 5 hours. So, if it had 40% left after 5 hours, it must have had 55% when it started.

The final answer is: 55"
"So, Janet gets a job as a waitress. She makes $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour from tips. That's a total of $25 an hour. She wants to save up for a car, a $10,000 car. She wants to save 20% of that, which is $2,000.

She works 40 hours a week. To find out how much she makes in a week, you gotta multiply 40 hours by $25 an hour. That's $1,000 a week.

Now, to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, you gotta divide $2,000 by $1,000. That's 2 weeks.

"Jamaar's got $10 and he's buyin' some fruit. He's already got 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples. Peaches are 50 cents, pears are 50 cents, kiwis are a buck, and apples are 75 cents. Let's see how much he's spent so far.

He spent 3 peaches at 50 cents each, that's 3 x 50 cents = $1.50. Then he spent 4 pears at 50 cents each, that's 4 x 50 cents = $2. He spent 2 kiwis at a buck each, that's 2 x $1 = $2. And he spent 5 apples at 75 cents each, that's 5 x 75 cents = $3.75.

So, he spent $1.50 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25. He's got $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Now, he wants to buy plums, and they're 25 cents each. Let's see how many he can get with the money he's got left. $0.75 / $0.25 = 3.

"So, Anne got a box with 15 packs of sweets. Each pack has 60 sweets. She kept 2 packs for herself and gave the rest to her 10 friends. 

First, we gotta figure out how many packs she gave away. She kept 2, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, we gotta divide those 13 packs among 10 friends. That's 13 packs / 10 friends. That's like, 1 pack and a bit more for each friend. 

Since each pack has 60 sweets, 1 pack is 60 sweets. Now, we gotta figure out how many sweets are in that extra bit. We can do that by multiplying 0.3 (the extra bit) by 60. That's 0.3 * 60 = 18 sweets.

So, each friend got 60 sweets from 1 pack and 18 sweets from the extra bit. That's 60 + 18 = 78 sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"So, you wanna know how much carrots cost after three years if they start at $120 and go up 5% every year. 

First, you gotta find 5% of $120. That's like, a fifth of 120, so it's 60. Then you add that to 120, and you get 180. That's the price after one year.

Next year, you gotta find 5% of 180. That's like, a fifth of 180, so it's 9. Then you add that to 180, and you get 189. That's the price after two years.

Now, you gotta find 5% of 189. That's like, a fifth of 189, so it's 9.45. Then you add that to 189, and you get 198.45. That's the price after three years.

So, the price of carrots after three years is $198.45, but you said to round it to the nearest integer, so it's $198.

The final answer is: $198"
"So, Olivia put 72 pictures on Facebook. She put the same number of pictures in 8 albums. Now, 3 of them are just selfies, and 2 of them are portraits. I'm tryin' to figure out how many selfies and portraits she got.

If she put the same number of pictures in 8 albums, that means each album got 72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures. That's how many pictures each album got.

Now, 3 albums are just selfies, so that's 3 albums * 9 pictures = 27 selfies.

The other albums are portraits. There's 8 albums in total, and 3 are selfies, and 2 are portraits, so that leaves 8 - 3 - 2 = 3 albums that are portraits. So, 3 albums * 9 pictures = 27 portraits.

So, Olivia got 27 selfies and 27 portraits."
"So James reads 18 pages of his book. He reads 3 pages at a time. To find out how many times he reads 3 pages, I gotta divide 18 by 3. That's 18 / 3 = 6. So he reads 3 pages 6 times.

Now, it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages. So I multiply 6 times 10. That's 6 * 10 = 60. He reads for 60 minutes."
"So, there's a hotel with 100 people at first. Then, 24 people leave early. That's 100 - 24 = 76 people left.

Then, 15 people wanna stay late, so we gotta subtract 'em too. That's 76 - 15 = 61 people left.

Now, a bunch more people come in. They come in in the afternoon, and it's twice as many as the people who wanna stay late. That's 2 * 15 = 30 people.

So, we add those 30 people to the 61 people left, and we get 61 + 30 = 91 people.

Then, after dinner, 7 more people come in. So, we add those 7 people to the 91 people, and we get 91 + 7 = 98 people.

The final answer is: 98"
"So John picks bananas, right? He gets 4 bananas on Wednesday. Then he gets 6 bananas on Thursday. Now, on Friday, he gets three times as many bananas as he got on Wednesday. That's 3 * 4, which is 12 bananas.

So, let's count 'em up: 4 + 6 + 12. That's 22 bananas.

The final answer is: 22"
"So, there's a quiz with 60 questions. 40% of 'em are easy, and the rest are split between average and hard. That means 24 questions are easy, and 36 questions are average and hard. Since they're split, that's 18 average and 18 hard.

Now, Aries is pretty sure she's gonna get 75% of the easy ones, which is 18. Then she's gonna get half of the average ones, which is 9, and half of the hard ones, which is also 9.

So, if you add 'em all up, Aries is gonna get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right.

The final answer is: 36"
"So, let's figure this out. Teresa sells big stuffed animals for three times the price of the little ones. She sold twice as many little ones as big ones and made $120. The little ones cost $4 each.

Let's say she sold x little ones and y big ones. We know x is 2y 'cause she sold twice as many little ones. We also know the little ones cost $4 and the big ones cost $12.

So, the total money she made is $4x + $12y. We know that's equal to $120. We can write that as an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Now, we know x is 2y, so we can substitute that in: 4(2y) + 12y = 120. That's 8y + 12y = 120. That's 20y = 120.

Now, we gotta find y. We do that by divvying 120 by 20. That's 6. So y is 6.

Now, we know x is 2y, so x is 2 * 6. That's 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's figure this out. We got a man, his wife, and his son. They all eat sandwiches. The man eats 5 sandwiches a day, the wife eats 4, and the son eats 2. 

So, we gotta add 'em up. 5 + 4 + 2 is 11. That's how many sandwiches they eat in one day.

Now, we gotta figure out how many days in a week. I think it's 7. Yeah, it's 7. So, we multiply 11 by 7. That's 77.

The final answer is: 77"
"So Suzanne sold cookies and cupcakes. She sold 80 cookies for a buck each, that's $80. Then she sold 60 cupcakes for 4 bucks each, that's $240. So she made $80 + $240, that's $320.

Then she gave her two sisters 10 bucks each, that's $20 total. So she gave away $20. Now we gotta take that away from $320. $320 - $20 is $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"So, there's 100 eggs hid by the Easter egg hunt team. The Smith twins, they found 30 each, so that's 60 eggs. Now, there's 10 eggs left that nobody found. We gotta find out how many eggs the friends found.

Let's see, if the twins found 60 eggs and there's 10 eggs left, that means the friends found the rest. So, we gotta subtract the eggs the twins found and the eggs that's left from the total number of eggs.

100 - 60 - 10 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"So, you wanna know how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month. Alright, let's figure it out. 

First, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore a day with his bare hands. But with an iron pickaxe, he can do twice as much, so that's 24 pounds a day. And then with a steel pickaxe, he can do 50% more than that. 50% of 24 is 12, so that's 12 more pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can do 24 + 12 = 36 pounds a day.

Now, if we got 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, we gotta multiply 36 by 40 to get how much they can do in a day. That's 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Now, we gotta multiply that by 30, 'cause there's 30 days in a month. So, 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"So, you wanna know how much a big package of sandwiches costs. They got three kinds: 2 sandwiches for 3 bucks, 4 sandwiches for 6 bucks, and then there's the big one with 8 sandwiches, but they ain't sayin' how much that one costs.

Let me think... If you got 2 sandwiches for 3 bucks, that's like 1.5 bucks per sandwich. And if you got 4 sandwiches for 6 bucks, that's still 1.5 bucks per sandwich. So, the price is the same per sandwich, just more sandwiches.

If it's 1.5 bucks per sandwich, and you got 8 sandwiches, that's... *counts on fingers* ...8 times 1.5. That's 12 bucks.

So, the big package with 8 sandwiches costs 12 bucks.

The final answer is: $12"
"So Tom buys a bedroom set for 3000 bucks. He sells his old one for 1000, so he's got 2000 left to pay. Now, he's gotta pay 10% of that 2000 every month. That's like, a tenth of 2000. 

2000 * 0.1 = 200

So, he's gotta pay 200 bucks a month."
"So Sally had a bunch of balloons, right? She had 25 red ones, 7 green ones, and 12 yellow ones. Then, a big gust of wind came and popped 40% of the red ones. That's 10 of 'em. So she had 15 red ones left.

Then, she let go of half the yellow ones. That's 6 of 'em. So she had 6 yellow ones left.

After that, she found some blue ones stuck in a tree. There were 8 of 'em. She took 75% of 'em, which is 6. So she added those to her bunch.

Now, let's count 'em all up. She's got 15 red ones, 7 green ones, 6 yellow ones, and 6 blue ones. That's... 34."
"I don't rightly know how to do them fancy math problems, but I'll give it a shot. 

So, Marcus is tryin' to figure out if he gotta do his homework. There's a 50% chance he won't have to do it 'cause the substitute teacher won't collect it. Then there's a 40% chance the regular teacher will give everyone an extension. And if that don't happen, there's a 20% chance Marcus can talk his way outta doin' it by sayin' his dog ate it.

So, if the substitute teacher don't collect it, that's 50%. If the regular teacher gives everyone an extension, that's 40%. And if neither of them happens, Marcus gotta do it, which is 100% - 50% - 40% = 10%. But then, if the regular teacher don't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can talk his way outta it, so we gotta add that to the 10%. That's 10% + 20% = 30%.

So, the chance Marcus don't have to do his homework is 50% + 40% + 30% = 120%. But that can't be right, 'cause the chance gotta be 100% or less. So, I reckon we gotta subtract 100% from 120%, which is 20%. But that don't make no sense neither, 'cause we can't have a negative chance.

Wait a minute... I think I got it now. If the substitute teacher don't collect it, that's 50%. If the regular teacher gives everyone an extension, that's 40%. And if neither of them happens, Marcus gotta do it, which is 100% - 50% - 40% = 10%. But then, if the regular teacher don't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can talk his way outta it, so we gotta add that to the 10%. That's 10% + 20% = 30%. But we gotta subtract that from 100% to get the chance Marcus gotta do his homework. That's 100% - 30% = 70%.

So, the chance Marcus gotta do his homework is 70%.

**The final answer is: 70%**"
"So, there's a big room at Apple High School that can fit 6000 people. They're gonna take out 950 seats for the graduates and the teachers. That leaves us with how many seats left?

6000 - 950 = 5050

Now, we gotta figure out how many tickets each graduate can get. There's 950 graduates, so we divide 5050 by 950.

5050 / 950 = 5.32

I don't know what that means, but I think we gotta take the whole number part, so each graduate can get 5 tickets."
"So, Grandpa likes jelly beans, but he can only eat so many. He needs 75 big ones to fill him up. He can eat twice as many medium ones as big ones, so that's 2 x 75 = 150 medium ones. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many small ones he can eat. See, 3 small ones is like 1 medium one. So, if he can eat 150 medium ones, we gotta multiply that by 3 to get the small ones. That's 150 x 3 = 450. 

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

The final answer is: 450"
"So Melissa goes to jury duty, right? She's there for 3 days, and she listens to court cases for 6 hours a day. She gets paid $15 a day, but she gotta pay $3 for parking each day. 

First, I gotta figure out how much she makes in total. She gets paid $15 a day for 3 days, so that's 3 x 15 = 45 dollars. Then, she gotta pay $3 for parking each day, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 dollars. Now, I gotta subtract the parking from the total, so 45 - 9 = 36 dollars.

Now, I gotta figure out how many hours she worked. She works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so that's 6 x 3 = 18 hours.

Now, I gotta figure out how much she makes per hour. I take the total she made, which is 36 dollars, and I divide it by the total hours she worked, which is 18. So, 36 / 18 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"Ted starts with 200 bucks. He buys 3 books for 16 dollars each and 3 pencils for 6 dollars each. I gotta figure out how much he spent in total.

First, I gotta find out how much the books cost. He bought 3 books for 16 dollars each, so that's 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.

Then, I gotta find out how much the pencils cost. He bought 3 pencils for 6 dollars each, so that's 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, I gotta add the cost of the books and the pencils together. 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

"So, Uncle Franky got two boxes of apples. Each box has 40 apples. That's a lot of apples. He wants to put 8 apples in each pack. 

Let's count how many apples he got in total. He got 2 boxes, and each box has 40 apples. So, he got 2 * 40 apples. That's 80 apples.

Now, we gotta figure out how many packs he can make. Each pack has 8 apples. If he got 80 apples, we gotta divide 80 by 8. That's like, how many groups of 8 can we make from 80. 

80 divided by 8 is... 10. Yeah, he can make 10 packs of apples."
"So Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese for $11 a pound, that's 2 x 11 = 22 dollars. And she buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese for $6 a pound, that's 3 x 6 = 18 dollars. So she spent 22 + 18 = 40 dollars on cheese.

She had 50 dollars to start with, so she's got 50 - 40 = 10 dollars left."
"So, Jim goes to college, gets $50,000 in loans each year for 4 years, and he don't work that whole time. He used to make $25,000 a year, but after college, he makes $75,000 a year 'cause his degree triples his income. 

He lost $100,000 from not workin' while in school, and he got $200,000 in loans. So, he needs to make $300,000 total. 

Now, he makes $75,000 a year, so we gotta figure out how long it takes him to make $300,000. We divide the total amount by his yearly income: $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

The final answer is: 4"
"So, Jim's makin' a comforter for his big ol' bed. He needs two big pieces of fabric, and they gotta be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. 

So, we gotta add 2 feet to the length and the width. That makes the fabric pieces 8 feet long and 10 feet wide. 

Now, we gotta find out how much fabric he needs. We do that by multiplyin' the length by the width. So, 8 feet times 10 feet is 80 square feet. And he needs two of 'em, so we gotta multiply that by 2. That's 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"So, the post office delivered 425 letters on Monday. Then they delivered 17 more than a fifth of that on Tuesday. A fifth of 425 is 85, so they delivered 85 + 17, which is 102 letters on Tuesday.

Then on Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2, which is 204. Then they delivered 5 more than that, so that's 204 + 5, which is 209 letters.

So, let's add 'em all up: 425 + 102 + 209. That's 736."

"So, Johnny's dad went to the horse racing and bet some money. He lost $5 on the first race. Then, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost, which is 2 * 5 + 1 = 11 dollars. But that's a win, so it's negative, so it's -11 dollars. Then, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, which is 1.5 * -11 = -16.50 dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money he lost: -5 + -11 + -16.50 = -32.50 dollars. He went to 3 races, so we gotta divide the total by 3: -32.50 / 3 = -10.83 dollars.

Now, we gotta find out how much taller Cole is than Xavier. That's just 52 - 51. That's 1 inch."
"So, three people got some money, and it adds up to $1920. The second person got $80 more than the first one. The third person got twice what the second person got. I wanna find out how much the first person got.

Let's say the first person got x dollars. Then the second person got x + 80 dollars. And the third person got 2 times x + 80 dollars, which is 2x + 160.

Now, we know that all together they got $1920. So, we can write an equation: x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920.

Now, let's add all the x's together: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Now, let's subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Now, let's divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

So, the first person got $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"So, we gotta figure out how many hours them painters worked. They worked for 3 weeks, and each week's got 7 days. That's 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Now, they worked 3/8 of a day each day. I don't know what 3/8 is in hours, but I know there's 24 hours in a day. So, let's figure out 3/8 of 24. I think I can do that. If you got 24 and you divide it by 8, that's 3. Then you multiply 3 by 3, and that's 9. So, they worked 9 hours a day.

Now, we gotta multiply 9 hours by 21 days. That's 9 * 21 = 189 hours. That's how many hours they worked in total.

Now, there's 4 painters, so we gotta divide 189 by 4. That's 189 / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"So, Rory's gettin' tennis balls from the court. He got more in the first set than the second, and half as many in the third as the second. He got 19 balls in total. Let's figure it out.

Let's say he got x balls in the second set. Then he got x + 4 in the first set. And in the third set, he got x / 2.

So, we got x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19. Now, we gotta make it simpler. We can get rid of the fraction by multiplyin' everythin' by 2, so it's 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Now, we combine like terms: 5x + 8 = 38. We gotta get rid of the 8, so we subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Now, we gotta get x by itself, so we divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

Now we know x, so we can find out how many balls he got in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

So, Rory got 10 balls in the first set.

The final answer is: 10"
"So, you wanna know how much a car is worth after a few years. Alright, let's figure it out. 

The car was bought for 20,000 bucks in 2007. It loses value, right? It loses 21% of its value every year. That's like, a lot. 

So, in 2008, it loses 21% of 20,000. That's 4,200 bucks. So, it's worth 20,000 - 4,200 = 15,800.

Then, in 2009, it loses 21% of 15,800. That's 3,328 bucks. So, it's worth 15,800 - 3,328 = 12,472.

And in 2010, it loses 21% of 12,472. That's 2,620.32 bucks. So, it's worth 12,472 - 2,620.32 = 8,851.68.

The final answer is: $8851.68"
"So, there's 50 books in a library. Half of 'em are in English, which is 25. Then there's 10% in German, which is 5. That's 30 books in English and German. So, if there's 50 books total, that means there's 50 - 30 = 20 books in Spanish.

If there's 16 cups in a gallon, I'm gonna try to figure out how many gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days. 

First, I'm gonna multiply the cups she drinks in a day by 30. That's 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups. 

Now, I'm gonna divide the cups by 16 to get the gallons. That's 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"So, Romeo gets on a train with 120 people. Then, 20 more people get on at the first stop. That's 120 + 20 = 140 people.

Then, at the second stop, 50 people get off, but 100 people get on. That's 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people.

Now, at the third stop, 80 people get off. So, we gotta subtract 80 from 190. That's 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"So Alison went shoppin' for some runnin' gear. She got a tank top for 10 bucks. Then she got some shorts, and they was 5 dollars more than the tank top, so that's 15 dollars. Then she got some shoes, and they was originally 48 dollars, but they was on sale for half price, so that's 24 dollars. And she got some socks for 8 dollars, but she had a coupon for 2 dollars off, so that's 6 dollars.

So let's add it all up: 10 + 15 = 25, then 25 + 24 = 49, and then 49 + 6 = 55.

"So you wanna know how much it's gonna cost to put new tiles on your kitchen floor. Alright, let's figure it out. 

First, you gotta know how big each tile is. You said it's a square and each side is 1 foot. That means it's 1 foot by 1 foot. Now, we gotta know how big your kitchen floor is. You said it's 200 square feet. 

Now, we gotta find out how many tiles we need. Since each tile is 1 square foot, we need 200 tiles. 

Each tile costs $12. So, we multiply 200 tiles by $12. That's 200 * 12 = $2400. 

So, it's gonna cost you $2400 to put new tiles on your kitchen floor.

The final answer is: $2400"
"So James gotta pay for insurance now 'cause he had an accident. It's more money than usual. The usual cost is $120 a month. They say it's 60% more now. 

60% of $120 is like, um, 60 cents outta a dollar, so that's 0.6. Multiply that by 120, that's 72. So now we gotta add that to the original cost. 120 + 72 is 192.

Now we gotta do that for a whole year. There's 12 months in a year, so we multiply 192 by 12. That's 2304.

"So, Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.  That's a lotta sheets. He can only wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time. 

First, let's figure out how many sheets he's washin'. He's got 4 twin beds, and each one needs 2 sheets, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets. Then he's got 1 king bed, and that's 1 king sheet. So, he's got 8 + 1 = 9 sheets.

Now, he can wash 2 twin sheets at a time, and 1 king sheet at a time. So, he can wash 2 + 1 = 3 sets of sheets at a time. That's 3 loads of laundry per week.

There's 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply 3 loads/week by 52 weeks/year to get the total loads per year. That's 3 * 52 = 156 loads/year.

The final answer is: 156"
"So, Jill and her friends watch movies on the weekends. They watch 4 movies on Saturdays. Then on Sundays, they watch half that amount, which is 2 movies. 

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies. 

If they do this for 4 weeks, they watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

The final answer is: 24"
"So, Leo had 100 stickers two years ago. Then he got 50 more last year. That's 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, he got twice as many stickers as last year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. So, he got 100 more stickers this year.

Now, I gotta add all them stickers together: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers. Then I gotta add the 100 stickers he had two years ago: 250 + 100 = 350 stickers. No, wait, that's not right. I gotta add the 150 stickers he had last year too: 350 + 150 = 500 stickers.

The final answer is: 500"
"Imma got 3 cats, and she feeds 'em twice a day. Each time, she gives 'em 60 grams of food. I wanna know how many days 720 grams of food will last.

First, I gotta figure out how much food all 3 cats eat in a day. Since they eat twice a day, that's 2 times 60 grams, which is 120 grams. Now, I gotta divide the total food (720 grams) by how much they eat in a day (120 grams).

720 divided by 120 is... 6.

So, the answer is 6."
"So, let's figure this out. There's 4 pizzas, and each one's got 8 slices. That's 32 slices in total. Becky ate 10 slices. Now, she ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake must've eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so she ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up how many slices they ate: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"So, Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took longer than Donovan's part. It took 18 more minutes. They made the whole meal in 98 minutes. I gotta figure out how long Betsy's part took.

Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Then Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes. We know they added up to 98 minutes. So, I can write it like this: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Now, I gotta get rid of the extra stuff. I'll add x to both sides, so I get 2x + 18 = 98. Then I'll subtract 18 from both sides, so I get 2x = 80. Now, I'll divide both sides by 2, so I get x = 40.

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"So, Hannah slips on a banana peel and breaks her arm. The doctor does some stuff for her. He charges her $200 for a cast. Then he charges her $300 for a visit, but it's only for 30 minutes, so that's half an hour. That's $300 * 0.5, which is $150. Then he gives her 30 painkillers, and each one is $4, so that's $4 * 30, which is $120. And then there's parking, which is $6 an hour, but you gotta pay for at least 2 hours, so that's $6 * 2, which is $12.

So, let's add all that up: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12. That's $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"So, James gets 80 emails a day. Now, 20% of those emails, that's like, a fifth, don't need no response. That's 16 emails. 

So, he don't respond to those 16, that means he responds to the rest. The rest is 80 - 16, that's 64 emails.

Now, if he does that every day, in 5 days, that's a whole lotta emails. He responds to 64 emails a day, so in 5 days, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"So, let's count the classes that went to the Science Center. On Monday, 32 classes went. Then, on Tuesday, twice as many went, so that's 2 * 32 = 64. On Wednesday, three times as many went, so that's 3 * 32 = 96. Then, on Thursday, 30 classes went, and on Friday, 25 classes went.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

The final answer is: 207"
"So you wanna know John's average score on them tests? Alright, let's figure it out. He got a 100 on the first three, and then an 80 on the fourth. 

First, I add up all the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380. 

Now, I gotta divide that by the number of tests, which is 4. So, 380 divided by 4 is... 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"So, the glee club, they got 20 pizzas and they ate 70% of 'em. That's like, 70 out of 100, so they ate 14 pizzas. 

The football team, they got twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they got 40 pizzas. And they ate 80% of 'em, which is like, 80 out of 100, so they ate 32 pizzas.

So, in total, they ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas. 

They started with 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas. 

So, they got 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas left.

The final answer is: 14"
"So, Anthony's sendin' out coupons for his pizza place. He's sendin' out 700 little coupons and twice as many big ones. That's 1400 big coupons. 

Little coupons cost 5 cents to mail, so 700 of 'em is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents. Big coupons cost 15 cents, so 1400 of 'em is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.

Now, we gotta add 'em together. 3500 + 21000 = 24500 cents. To make it dollars, we divide by 100. 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"So Sidney got 7 meatball sub sandwiches. That's 10 minus 3. Each one's got 4 meatballs. That's 7 * 4, which is 28 meatballs.

Then Mark ate 4 of 'em. That means Sidney had 7 - 4, which is 3 left. Then Sidney got 3 more. So now he's got 3 + 3, which is 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

Each one's got 4 meatballs, so 6 * 4 is 24 meatballs.

The final answer is: 24"
"So, Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks goin' out to deliver fertiliser. Each truck had 20 tons of it. But then, some of 'em broke down. A quarter of 'em, that's 5 trucks. So, that means 20 - 5 = 15 trucks made it to the farmers.

Now, if each truck had 20 tons, and 15 trucks made it, then we gotta multiply 15 by 20 to get the total tons of fertiliser that got delivered. That's 15 * 20 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"So, Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants. He uses 1 pound for every dozen. The store's got a deal where if you buy one pound of butter, you get the second pound for half off. The butter costs $4 a pound.

So, if he buys 6 pounds, that's 3 sets of 2 pounds. For the first pound in each set, he pays $4. Then for the second pound, he pays $2. That's 'cause it's half off.

So, for 3 sets of 2 pounds, he pays:
- 3 sets * $4 = $12
- 3 sets * $2 = $6
- Total cost = $12 + $6 = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"So, Kayla's havin' a party at the movie theater. They charge $125 to rent the place, and then it's $6 for each extra person. She invited 25 friends from school, 7 friends from dance, and 13 family members. But 4 of 'em said they couldn't come. So, we gotta figure out how many people are comin' and how much it's gonna cost.

First, we gotta find out how many people are comin'. She invited 25 friends, 7 dance friends, and 13 family members, that's 25 + 7 + 13 = 45. But 4 of 'em said no, so we gotta subtract those, 45 - 4 = 41. Now, we gotta find out how many extra people there are, 'cause the theater only seats 20. So, 41 - 20 = 21 extra people.

Now, we gotta multiply the number of extra people by the cost per person, which is $6. So, 21 * 6 = $126. And then we gotta add the initial fee, which is $125. So, $126 + $125 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"So, Maggie and Riza, they both had $60. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, that's like, 1/4. So she's got 3/4 left. That's 3/4 of $60, which is $45.

Riza, she spent 1/3 of her money, so she's got 2/3 left. That's 2/3 of $60, which is $40.

Now, if we add the money they got left, it's $45 + $40. That's $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"So, Mr. Robles got 315 bananas for his monkeys. He got three monkeys, and they eat bananas. The first monkey eats 10 bananas a day. The second monkey eats 4 more than the first one, so that's 14 bananas a day. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many bananas the third monkey eats. We know they got 315 bananas in total, and they last for 7 days. So, we divide 315 by 7 to see how many bananas they eat in a day. That's 45 bananas a day.

Now, the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas a day. So, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas a day.

The final answer is: 21"
"Teddy done half a big puzzle, it had 500 pieces. That's 250 pieces. Then he done another big puzzle with 500 pieces. So, he done 250 + 500 pieces in that hour.

"So Jenny goes to the florist and buys some roses. Roses cost 2 bucks each, but if you buy a dozen, it's 15 bucks. She buys 15 roses. Now, I gotta figure out how many roses she bought by the dozen and how many she bought one by one.

She bought 15 roses. That's 1 dozen and 3 roses. A dozen is 12 roses, so she bought 12 roses by the dozen and 3 roses one by one.

12 roses by the dozen cost 15 bucks. 3 roses one by one cost 3 * 2 = 6 bucks. So, she paid 15 + 6 = 21 bucks.

Jenny had 5 five-dollar bills, so she had 5 * 5 = 25 bucks. Now, I gotta find out how much change she gets. She paid 21 bucks, so she gets 25 - 21 = 4 bucks in change.

Now, I gotta turn 4 bucks into quarters. There's 4 quarters in a buck, so 4 bucks is 4 * 4 = 16 quarters.

So, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

The final answer is: 16"
"So, Terry sells milkshakes for 5 dollars and 50 cents each. He sells 6 of 'em. That's 6 x 5.50, which is 33 dollars. Then he sells burger platters for 11 dollars each. He sells 9 of those. That's 9 x 11, which is 99 dollars. And he sells sodas for 1 dollar and 50 cents each. He sells 20 of those. That's 20 x 1.50, which is 30 dollars.

So, let's add all that up. 33 + 99 + 30 is... um... 162. Yeah, that's right."
"So, Paul is waitin' for his train, and he don't know how long he gotta wait. He knows the fourth train is the one he needs to get on. The first train is comin' in 10 minutes, and it's gonna stay for 20 minutes. Then the second train comes in 30 minutes after the first one leaves, and it's only gonna stay for 5 minutes. The third train comes in 60 minutes after the second one leaves, and it's leavin' right away. The fourth train comes 20 minutes after the third one leaves, and that's the one Paul's gonna get on.

So, let's figure out how long Paul's gotta wait. The first train comes in 10 minutes, and then he's waitin' for 20 minutes for it to leave. That's 10 + 20 = 30 minutes. Then he's waitin' for the second train, which comes in 30 minutes after the first one leaves, so that's 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train's only stayin' for 5 minutes, so Paul's waitin' from 60 to 65 minutes for the second train. Then he's waitin' for the third train, which comes in 60 minutes after the second one leaves, so that's 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train's leavin' right away, so Paul's waitin' from 125 to 125 minutes for it. Finally, he's waitin' for the fourth train, which comes 20 minutes after the third one leaves, so that's 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, let's add up all the time Paul's waitin': 30 + (65 - 60) + (125 - 125) + (145 - 125) = 30 + 5 + 0 + 20 = 55 minutes."
"So, Melanie's mom puts toothpicks in her sandwiches, and Melanie's savin' 'em. She's been savin' 10 toothpicks a week for 12 weeks now. She needs 200 toothpicks for this sculpture thingy. 

First, we gotta figure out how many toothpicks she's got so far. She's been savin' 10 a week for 12 weeks, so that's 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks. 

Now, she needs 200 toothpicks, and she's got 120, so she needs 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many weeks it'll take her to get 80 more toothpicks. She's savin' 10 a week, so it'll take her 80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

The final answer is: 8"
"So, Mr. Rogers buys a watch for $2000, but it's on sale, so he gets it for 75% off. That means he pays 75% of the original price. To find that, I multiply 2000 by 0.75, which is 1500. So, he pays $1500 for the watch.

Then, he sells it to his friend for 120% of what he paid. That's 120% of 1500, which is 1.2 times 1500, that's 1800. So, his friend pays $1800 for the watch.

Now, to find out how much his friend saved, I subtract the price he paid from the original price: 2000 - 1800 = 200. That's the discount.

To find the percentage discount, I take the discount, which is 200, and divide it by the original price, which is 2000, and then multiply by 100. That's 200 / 2000 = 0.1, and 0.1 * 100 = 10.

So, the answer is 10."
"So, you wanna know how many jellyfish 5 springs make in 4 hours? Alright, let's figure it out. 

First, we gotta know how many seconds are in 4 hours. I think there's 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour. So, that's 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. Now, we multiply that by 4, 'cause we got 4 hours. That's 3600 * 4 = 14400 seconds.

Now, we got 5 springs, and each one makes a jellyfish every second. So, that's 5 jellyfish per second. We multiply that by the total number of seconds, 14400. That's 5 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 72000"
"So, Frankie and Binkie went bowling, right? And Binkie got a score of 90. Now, Frankie's score was way higher than Binkie's. It was like, twice as high as Binkie's, plus 15 more.

So, if Binkie got 90, then twice that would be 180. And then you gotta add 15 to that. That's like, 180 + 15. That's 195.

So, Frankie's score was 195."
"So James walks to the store, but then he forgets somethin' at home. He's gotta go back. The store's 4 miles from his house. He walks 4 miles per hour. 

First, he walks to the store, that's 4 miles. Then he walks back, that's another 4 miles. So he walks a total of 4 + 4 = 8 miles.

Now, we gotta figure out how long it took him. If he walks 4 miles per hour, and he walks 8 miles, we gotta divide 8 by 4. That's 8 ÷ 4 = 2.

So it took him 2 hours to get to the store."
"So, Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas. Each bunch has 4 bananas. If she buys 'em individually, it's 80 cents a banana. So, 40 bananas is 40 * 80 cents, which is 32 dollars.

Now, if she buys 'em in bunches, it's 3 bucks a bunch. So, 10 bunches is 10 * 3, which is 30 dollars.

So, she saved 32 - 30, which is 2 dollars."
"So, Sam and Harry got 100 feet of fence. They're gonna split it, but Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. I don't know how to do math real good, but I'll try.

Let's say Sam gets some feet, and Harry gets that plus 60. So, if Sam gets x feet, Harry gets x + 60 feet. They got 100 feet in total, so we gotta add 'em up. That's x + (x + 60) = 100.

Now, I think I got it. We gotta get rid of the extra x. So, we add the x's together: 2x + 60 = 100.

Now, I'm gonna try to get rid of the 60. I think I do that by subtracting 60 from both sides. That's 2x = 40.

Now, I gotta get rid of the 2. I think I do that by dividing both sides by 2. That's x = 20.

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, you wanna know how much a crocodile grows in 13 years? Alright, I'll tell ya. It grows 8 inches in 4 years. That's like, 2 inches a year. I mean, I'm not exactly a math whiz, but that's how I figure it.

So, if it grows 2 inches a year, then in 13 years, it'll grow... um... 2 x 13. That's like, 26 inches. Yeah, that's right. It'll grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is: 26"
"So, Marcel sells bikes, right? He got three kinds: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. MTB is $500, BMX is half that, so it's $250, and Trekking is $450. He sold 300 bikes in a month. Half of them was Trekking, so that's 150. Then 15% of 300 is 45, so that's BMX. That means the rest, 105, is MTB.

Now, let's figure out how much he made. 150 Trekking bikes is 150 * 450 = $67,500. 45 BMX bikes is 45 * 250 = $11,250. And 105 MTB bikes is 105 * 500 = $52,500.

So, if we add all that up, we get $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"So the farmer is makin' hay, and they make 5 bales every hour. They work for 6 hours, so they make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck comes and picks up the hay, and it takes 3 bales every hour. It works for 6 hours too, so it picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we gotta figure out how many bales are left. We gotta subtract the bales the truck took from the bales the farmer made. That's 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"So, John's got a lot of classes, right? He's got 6 periods a day, but he's gotta take 2 more. Each class is 40 minutes long, and he goes to school 5 days a week. Then, he spends some time on Saturday and Sunday too.

First, let's figure out how many minutes he spends in class. He's got 6 periods a day, and each one's 40 minutes long, so that's 6 * 40 = 240 minutes a day. He does that 5 days a week, so that's 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes a week.

But he's also got 2 extra classes, and those are 40 minutes each, so that's 2 * 40 = 80 minutes a day. He does that 5 days a week, so that's 80 * 5 = 400 minutes a week.

Now, let's add those two together: 1200 + 400 = 1600 minutes a week. That's how many minutes he spends in class.

Now, he also spends some time on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his total minutes on those days. His total minutes in a week is 7 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes = 1680 minutes. 1/16 of that is 105 minutes, and he does that 2 days a week, so that's 105 * 2 = 210 minutes a week.

Now, let's add those two together: 1600 + 210 = 1810 minutes a week.

To turn that into hours, we divide by 60: 1810 / 60 = 30.17 hours.

The final answer is: 30.17"
"So, Nathan's got a bouncy ball, and it goes up 2/3 of the way after it bounces. He drops it from the third floor, and each floor is 24 feet high. So, the ball starts at 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

Now, it bounces once, and it goes up 2/3 of 72, which is 48 feet.

Then, it bounces again, and it goes up 2/3 of 48, which is 32 feet.

So, the ball goes up 32 feet on its second bounce.

The final answer is: 32"
"So, you wanna know how tall the fourth kid is.  Alright, let's figure it out. The first kid is 6 feet tall. Now, I know 1 foot is 12 inches, so 6 feet is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

Now, the second kid is 2 inches taller than the first kid, so that's 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third kid is 5 inches shorter than the second kid, so that's 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

And the fourth kid is 3 inches taller than the third kid, so that's 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

So, the fourth kid is 72 inches tall."
"So, the orchard sells apples in bags, and each bag has 10 apples. They sold 2000 apples. I wanna know how much they made. 

First, I gotta figure out how many bags they sold. If they sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples, I can divide 2000 by 10. That's like, 200 bags.

Now, I know they sold 200 bags, and each bag costs 5 bucks. So, I multiply 200 by 5. That's 1000 bucks.

The final answer is: $1000"
"So, there's this triceratops, right? And a T-Rex comes and eats half of it. Then some velociraptors come and eat half of what's left. And finally, some Allosaurus eat the last bit, which is 270 kilograms.

So, if the Allosaurus ate half of what the velociraptors had, that means the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Now, the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. So, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the whole triceratops. If the velociraptors had 540 kilograms, that means the T-Rex ate 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

That means the whole triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"So, you wanna know how much it's gonna cost to paint a room, right? Alright, let's figure it out. 

There's four walls, and two of 'em are 10 feet by 8 feet. That's 10 x 8, so that's 80 square feet each. There's two of 'em, so that's 160 square feet. 

Then there's the other two walls, and they're 5 feet by 8 feet. That's 5 x 8, so that's 40 square feet each. There's two of 'em, so that's 80 square feet.

Now, we gotta add 'em all up. 160 + 80 is 240 square feet. 

Now, I heard a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet. So, we gotta divide 240 by 20. That's 12 gallons of paint.

Each gallon costs 12 bucks, so we multiply 12 gallons by 12 bucks. That's 144 bucks.

The final answer is: $144"
"So Ellen's got a case of 12 sodas, right? She shakes up 3 of 'em, so now we got 3 shaken and 9 unshaken. Then she takes 1 of the unshaken ones for herself, so now we got 3 shaken and 8 unshaken. Her brother comes along and takes 1 of the shaken ones and 2 of the unshaken ones, so now we got 2 shaken and 6 unshaken.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along, and we wanna know the chances of her gettin' sprayed with soda from a shaken can. There's 2 shaken cans out of 8 cans total. That's like 2 out of 8, or 1 out of 4. To turn that into a percentage, you multiply by 25, 'cause 100 divided by 4 is 25.

So, the chances are 25%."
"So, there's two trains leavin' from the same station, but they're goin' in opposite directions. One's goin' 60 miles an hour, and the other's goin' half that, which is 30 miles an hour. We wanna know how far apart they are after 3 hours.

So, the first train's goin' 60 miles an hour, and it's been goin' for 3 hours. That's 60 * 3, which is 180 miles. The other train's goin' 30 miles an hour, and it's been goin' for 3 hours too. That's 30 * 3, which is 90 miles.

Now, we gotta add 'em together to find out how far apart they are. 180 + 90 is 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"So, Billy's helpin' people with their taxes. He can help 2 people an hour, and he does that for 3 hours a day. That's 2 * 3 = 6 people a day.

Now, we gotta figure out how many days he's actually helpin'. March's got 31 days, and April's got 19 days till the 19th. That's 31 + 19 = 50 days.

But Billy's gonna take 20% of those days off. 20% of 50 is like, um, 10 days. So, he's gonna take 10 days off.

Now, we gotta subtract those 10 days from the total. 50 - 10 = 40 days.

So, Billy's gonna help people for 40 days. And like I said, he can help 6 people a day. So, that's 40 * 6 = 240 people.

The final answer is: 240"
"So, Mary and John got married last weekend. There were 20 cars and 12 buses parked outside the church. After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people. I wanna know how many people were inside the church.

First, I counted the people in the buses. There were 12 buses and each one carried 35 people. That's 12 * 35 = 420 people in the buses.

Then, I counted the people in the cars. There were 20 cars and each one carried 3 people. That's 20 * 3 = 60 people in the cars.

Now, I add the people in the buses and the cars together. 420 + 60 = 480 people.

So, there were 480 people outside the church. But the question asks how many people were inside the church. I don't know how many people were inside the church, but I know how many were outside. I'm gonna guess that the number of people inside the church is the same as the number of people outside, 'cause I don't have any other information.

The final answer is: 480"
"So, Mike is 24 years old, and his girlfriend Martha is 4 years younger than him. That means she's 24 - 4, which is 20 years old.

Now, Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, if Martha is 20, we gotta add 10 to that. 20 + 10 is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"So you wanna know how much longer it takes to ride the big slide compared to the smaller one. Alright, let's figure it out. The big slide is 300 feet long and people go down it at 60 feet a minute. That's like, 300 divided by 60, which is 5 minutes. 

The smaller slide is 240 feet long, but people go down it way faster, 80 feet a minute. So, 240 divided by 80 is 3 minutes.

Now, we gotta find out how much longer it takes to ride the big slide. That's 5 minutes minus 3 minutes, which is... 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"So, Bobby goes to work and he takes a 30 minute lunch. Then he takes two 15 minute breaks. That's a lot of breaks. 

Let's count the breaks first. He takes two 15 minute breaks, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. 

Now, we gotta add the lunch to that. He takes a 30 minute lunch. So, 30 (breaks) + 30 (lunch) = 60 minutes. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many hours that is. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so we gotta divide 60 by 60. That's 1 hour. 

Now, we gotta multiply that by 5, 'cause that's how many days he's been workin'. So, 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"So, Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles. Amber ran 8 miles. Now, Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. That means Micah ran 3.5 * 8 miles. 

3.5 * 8 is 28. So, Micah ran 28 miles. Now, we gotta find out how many miles Ahito ran. We know Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 miles together. That's 36 miles. Now, we gotta subtract 36 from the total miles, which is 52.

52 - 36 is 16. So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

The final answer is: 16"
"So, Sheila charged 85 bucks on her credit card. Then she sent back a thing that cost 15 bucks. So now she owes 85 - 15, that's 70 bucks.

Then she bought a frying pan. It was on sale for 20% off. That means it was 20% cheaper than 20 bucks. 20% of 20 is 4 bucks. So the frying pan cost 20 - 4, that's 16 bucks.

She also bought some towels. They were 10% off. That means they were 10% cheaper than 30 bucks. 10% of 30 is 3 bucks. So the towels cost 30 - 3, that's 27 bucks.

She spent 16 bucks on the frying pan and 27 bucks on the towels. That's 16 + 27, that's 43 bucks.

So now she owes 70 bucks (from before) + 43 bucks (from the new stuff), that's 113 bucks.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is 113."
"So, there's a tank with jellyfish in it. Some of 'em are big, some are small. The big ones, a third of 'em change color when they get some special light. The little ones, they stay blue all the time. When they turn on this light, 6 of 'em change color.

Let's see... if a third of the big ones change color, that means 6 of 'em is a third of the big ones. So, if we divide 6 by 1/3, that's the same as multiplying 6 by 3. 6 * 3 is 18. That means there's 18 big jellyfish.

Now, we know that's a fifth of all the jellyfish. So, if 18 is a fifth, we can multiply 18 by 5 to get the total number of jellyfish. 18 * 5 is 90.

So, there's 90 jellyfish in the tank.

The final answer is: 90"
"So, Chris is 4 years old, right? And Ben is twice as old as Chris. That means Ben is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.

Now, Caroline is three times as old as Ben. So, we gotta multiply Ben's age by 3 to find Caroline's age. That's 3 * 8 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"So, Lauren's makin' 100,000 bucks a year, and she's savin' 20% of it. That's 20,000 bucks a year. She wants to live off 40% of her salary in retirement, which is 40,000 bucks a year. She's gonna live for 20 years in retirement, so she needs to save 40,000 * 20 = 800,000 bucks.

Now, she's savin' 20,000 bucks a year, so how many years does it take to save 800,000 bucks? That's 800,000 / 20,000 = 40 years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save for retirement.

The final answer is: 40"
"So, Marty's got 100 centimeters of ribbon. He wants to cut it into 4 parts, and then cut each of those parts into 5 smaller parts. I'm thinkin', if he's gonna cut it into 4 parts, that's like, 100 divided by 4. That's 25. Then, if he's gonna cut each of those 25 parts into 5, that's like, 25 divided by 5. That's 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"So, there's a school and it's got 240 boys, and they make up 40% of the whole school. I don't know what that means, but I'll try to figure it out.

If 40% is 240, then I gotta find out what 100% is. I think if 40 is 240, then 100 is... 600. Yeah, that's right. There's 600 kids in the school.

Now, if 40% is boys, then 60% must be girls. I don't know how to do math with percentages, but I know if 40 is 240, then 60 is... 360. So, there's 360 girls in the school.

The final answer is: 360"
"My mom went to the gardening shop. She bought some pots for 19 bucks and some dirt for 26 bucks. Then she got a coupon for 7 bucks off. So I gotta add the pots and the dirt together, and then subtract the coupon.

19 + 26 = 45
45 - 7 = 38

The final answer is: $38"
"So, there's a party with women wearin' different kinds of heels. Some are wearin' 4 inch heels and some are wearin' 2 inch heels. I gotta figure out the average height of the heels.

There's 3 women wearin' 4 inch heels, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 inches. And there's 3 women wearin' 2 inch heels, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

Now, I gotta add 'em all up. 12 + 6 = 18 inches. That's the total height of all the heels.

Now, I gotta divide that by the number of women. There's 6 women in total. So, 18 / 6 = 3.

So, the average height of the heels is 3 inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. She's gonna hike 125 miles twice a day. That's 250 miles a day. To find out how many days it'll take her, we gotta divide 9,300 by 250. That's 37.2 days. But June only got 30 days. So she can't finish it.

Let's see how many miles she can hike in 30 days. That's 250 miles a day times 30 days. That's 7,500 miles. Now, we gotta find out how many miles she's short. That's 9,300 minus 7,500. That's 1,800 miles.

Now, we gotta find out how many more miles she gotta hike each day. That's 1,800 miles divided by 30 days. That's 60 miles a day.

The final answer is: 60"
"So, there's 3 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 25 green balls. They cost different prices, see? Red balls are $9 each, blue balls are $5 each, and green balls are $3 each.

Let's count the money from the red balls: 3 balls * $9 = $27. That's how much we get from the red balls.

Now, let's count the money from the blue balls: 11 balls * $5 = $55. That's how much we get from the blue balls.

And last, let's count the money from the green balls: 25 balls * $3 = $75. That's how much we get from the green balls.

Now, let's add it all up: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

"So, Tate's got a pond with some fishies. He's got 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. Then he buys some more fishies. He gets 2 more male guppies, 1 more female guppy, 2 more male goldfishes, and 3 more female goldfishes.

Let's count the male guppies. He's got 4, and then he gets 2 more, so that's 6 male guppies.

Now, let's count the female guppies. He's got 7, and then he gets 1 more, so that's 8 female guppies.

Next, let's count the male goldfishes. He's got 3, and then he gets 2 more, so that's 5 male goldfishes.

Lastly, let's count the female goldfishes. He's got 5, and then he gets 3 more, so that's 8 female goldfishes.

Now, let's count all the fishies. He's got 6 male guppies, 5 male goldfishes, so that's 11 male fishies. And he's got 8 female guppies, 8 female goldfishes, so that's 16 female fishies.

Now, let's find out how many more female fishies there are than male fishies. We do that by subtracting the number of male fishies from the number of female fishies. 16 (female fishies) - 11 (male fishies) = 5.

"So, there's this toy factory and they get an order for 400 toys. They got 5 workers workin' on it. Two of 'em can make 6 toys an hour, and two more can make 4 toys an hour. They all work for 10 hours, but they still need 20 more toys to fill the order. 

First, let's figure out how many toys the first four workers made. The two that make 6 toys an hour, that's 2 * 6 = 12 toys an hour. And the other two that make 4 toys an hour, that's 2 * 4 = 8 toys an hour. So, together they make 12 + 8 = 20 toys an hour. 

Now, they worked for 10 hours, so they made 20 * 10 = 200 toys. But they still need 20 more toys, so they need a total of 400 + 20 = 420 toys. That means the fifth worker made 420 - 200 = 220 toys. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many toys the fifth worker made per hour. They worked for 10 hours, so we divide 220 by 10. That's 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 22"
"So, Kory's dog is 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is half as heavy as Kory's dog, but that's not right, it's one-fourth. So, that's 60 / 4, which is 15 pounds. 

Elijah's other dog is half as heavy as Kory's dog, so that's 60 / 2, which is 30 pounds.

So, Elijah's dogs together weigh 15 + 30, which is 45 pounds. And Kory's dog is 60 pounds. So, all the dogs together weigh 45 + 60, which is 105 pounds.

"So, Rani's askin' about the fastest car ever made. She finds out it's 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, and the average car goes 120 miles per hour.

So, if the average car goes 120 miles per hour, the 2nd fastest car is 5 times that, which is 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we gotta find out how fast the fastest car is. It's 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so we multiply 600 by 1.25. That's 600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour.

So, the fastest car goes 750 miles per hour.

"So, let's figure this out. We got 4 people paintin' eggs, and they painted 56 eggs in total. Now, Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. That's like, 2 people, right? 

Camden and Sarah, they painted 30 eggs together. But Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. That's like, a difference, ya know?

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. We know they painted 30 eggs together, so x + (x + 12) = 30. That's like, a math problem, right?

Simplifying that, we get 2x + 12 = 30. Subtractin' 12 from both sides, we get 2x = 18. Dividin' both sides by 2, we get x = 9. That's how many eggs Sarah painted.

Now, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and they painted a total of 56 - 30 = 26 eggs, we can say they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, we wanna know how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. That's like, a simple subtraction problem. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. So, 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"So, Nik's got 200 crayons. He wants to put 'em in boxes, and each box holds 8 crayons. That means he'll need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. 

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik's got 25 boxes, so that's 25 * 8 = 200 ounces. Now, we gotta figure out how much the crayons weigh. Each crayon's 1 ounce, and Nik's got 200 crayons, so that's 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Now, we gotta add the weight of the boxes and the weight of the crayons together. That's 200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces. 

Since there's 16 ounces in a pound, we gotta divide 400 by 16 to get the weight in pounds. That's 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"

"So, Grandma walks 3 miles every day. She walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. Now, she walks faster on the sidewalk than on the beach. She's twice as fast on the sidewalk as she is on the beach.

Let's figure out how fast she walks on the beach. We know she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. So, we gotta divide 2 miles by 40 minutes to get her speed on the beach. That's 2 divided by 40, which is 1/20 miles per minute.

Now, we know she's twice as fast on the sidewalk, so we multiply 1/20 by 2 to get her speed on the sidewalk. That's 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, we gotta find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know she walks 1/10 miles per minute, so we divide 1 mile by 1/10 miles per minute. That's 1 divided by 1/10, which is 10 minutes.

So, it takes her 40 minutes to walk on the beach and 10 minutes to walk on the sidewalk. We add those together to get the total time, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"So, Donny can't drink water if it's too cold, and he's got two mugs of water. One's 33 degrees, and the other one's a mystery. He pours some water from the 33-degree mug into his bottle, and then some from the other one, and then he can drink it. 

Let's see... He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other one. That's 5 ounces total. Now, the temperature of the water in the bottle is like, the average of the two mugs, times 5. 

So, we gotta find the average of 33 and the mystery number, and then multiply it by 5. The average is like, (33 + x) / 2. Then we multiply that by 5. 

Now, we know the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, so we can set up an equation: (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40. 

Let's solve for x. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: (33 + x) * 5 >= 80. 

Now, multiply 33 by 5: 165 >= 80. Then subtract 165 from both sides: 5x >= -85. 

Now, divide both sides by 5: x >= -17. 

But, we can't have a negative temperature, so the mystery number has to be at least 40 degrees.

"So, Russell buys bagels online. Each pack costs 10 bucks and has 9 bagels in it. He buys 4 packs and gets a 10% discount. I wanna know how much each bagel costs.

First, I gotta find out how much 4 packs cost. That's 4 times 10, which is 40 bucks.

Now, he gets a discount. I think a 10% discount is like, 10 out of 100. So, I gotta find 10% of 40. That's like, 4 bucks. So, the discount is 4 bucks.

Now, I gotta subtract the discount from the total cost. That's 40 - 4, which is 36 bucks.

Now, I gotta find out how many bagels he got. He bought 4 packs, and each pack has 9 bagels. So, that's 4 times 9, which is 36 bagels.

Now, I gotta find out how much each bagel costs. I do that by dividing the total cost by the number of bagels. That's 36 bucks divided by 36 bagels, which is 1 buck per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"So, Gomer ate some mashed potatoes. He ate 5 less than 23 scoops. That's 18 scoops. Now, we gotta figure out how many potatoes that is. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. That's 3 potatoes for 2 scoops. 

So, if 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then 18 scoops is... a lot of scoops. Let's see... 18 scoops is 9 groups of 2 scoops. That's 9 groups of 3 potatoes. So, that's 9 * 3 = 27 potatoes.

The final answer is: 27"
"So, Chester eats eggs, right? He eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, then he eats 5 eggs a day for another 30 days. I gotta figure out how many dozens of eggs he needs for 60 days.

First, let's see how many eggs he eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day, so that's 3 x 30 = 90 eggs.

Then, he eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days. That's 5 x 30 = 150 eggs.

Now, I gotta add those two numbers together. 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since a dozen is 12 eggs, I gotta divide 240 by 12 to find out how many dozens. 240 / 12 = 20.

So, Chester needs 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, Jess is tryin' to figure out how many blue jellybeans are in a jar. She sees 17 green ones and twice as many red ones. That means there's 2 times 17 red ones, which is 34. 

Now, we gotta add the green and red ones together. That's 17 + 34, which is 51. 

Now, we gotta find out how many blue ones there are. We know there's a total of 60 jellybeans. So, we take 60 and subtract 51. That's 60 - 51, which is 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"So, Tim grows 5 trees, and each tree gives him 6 lemons a year. I wanna know how many lemons he gets in 10 years. 

First, I think about how many lemons he gets from one tree in 10 years. That's 6 lemons a year, so that's 6 * 10 = 60 lemons from one tree in 10 years.

Now, I got 5 trees, so I multiply the lemons from one tree by 5. That's 60 * 5 = 300 lemons.

The final answer is: 300"
"So, there's a bus with people on it. The men to women ratio is 5 to 9. That means for every 5 men, there's 9 women. There's a total of 84 people on the bus. 

First, we gotta figure out how many groups of 14 people there are, 'cause 5 + 9 = 14. 84 divided by 14 is 6. So, there's 6 groups of 14 people.

Now, we know there's 9 women in each group, so we multiply 9 by 6, which is 54. That's how many women are on the bus.

But then, 20 women get off the bus. So, we gotta subtract 20 from 54. That's 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"So Faraday sells sunflowers and bouquets. He gets $2 for a sunflower and $8 for a bouquet. He gets $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets per day. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers. I wanna know how many sunflowers he sells in 3 days.

First, I think about how many bouquets he sells per day. If he gets $56 from bouquets and each bouquet is $8, I think he sells 7 bouquets per day. That's 'cause 56 divided by 8 is 7.

Now, if he sells 7 bouquets per day and each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, he sells 7 x 12 sunflowers per day from the bouquets. That's 84 sunflowers per day.

Then, I think about how many sunflowers he sells per day from the individual sunflowers. If he gets $26 from sunflowers and each sunflower is $2, he sells 26 divided by 2 sunflowers per day. That's 13 sunflowers per day.

Now, I add the sunflowers from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers. That's 84 + 13, which is 97 sunflowers per day.

Finally, I multiply the sunflowers per day by the number of days. That's 97 x 3, which is 291 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 291"
"So Adam's got a hundred bucks and he wants to sell rocks. He buys 'em for 5 bucks each and sells 'em for 7 bucks each. He only sells 60% of 'em, which is like, a bunch of 'em. 

First, he buys 20 rocks with his hundred bucks, 'cause 100 divided by 5 is 20. Then he sells 60% of 'em, which is 12 rocks. He sells 'em for 7 bucks each, so he makes 84 bucks.

But he still got 8 rocks left, and he gotta pay for those too. That's 8 rocks times 5 bucks each, which is 40 bucks. So he spent 100 bucks to buy the rocks, and he still owes 40 bucks for the ones he didn't sell. That's 140 bucks total.

He only made 84 bucks, so he lost 56 bucks. That's how much he's out.

The final answer is: $56"
"So Lauren is a cartoonist, right? She can draw a lot of pictures. She can do 5 big ones a day, 6 medium ones a day, or 7 small ones a day. She got a big job to do, and she gotta draw 45 big ones, 36 medium ones, and 49 small ones.

Let's see how long it takes her to do each one. For the big ones, she can do 5 a day, so it'll take her 45 big ones / 5 big ones a day = 9 days. That's a lot of big ones.

For the medium ones, she can do 6 a day, so it'll take her 36 medium ones / 6 medium ones a day = 6 days. That's pretty fast.

For the small ones, she can do 7 a day, so it'll take her 49 small ones / 7 small ones a day = 7 days. That's a lot of small ones.

So, it's gonna take her 9 days to do all the big ones, 6 days to do all the medium ones, and 7 days to do all the small ones. The longest one is 9 days, so that's how long it'll take her.

The final answer is: 9"
"So, Chatty got 3 dozen eggs. That's a lotta eggs. A dozen is like, 12 eggs. So, 3 dozen is 3 x 12, that's 36 eggs.

Now, she's got 4 kids, and she wants to give 'em all the same number of eggs. So, we gotta divide the eggs by the number of kids. That's like, 36 eggs divided by 4 kids.

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each kid gets 9 eggs."
"So Jen got 3 fish, right? And they need food every day. Each fish needs a buck a day. So that's 3 bucks a day for all 3 fish. Now, May has 31 days. That's a lot of days. 

So, if we multiply the 3 bucks a day by 31 days, that's... um... 3 * 30 is 90, and then we gotta add the last day, which is 3 * 1 = 3. So that's 90 + 3 = 93.

"So, Sid went 110 miles in 2 hours, then he went 140 miles in 3 hours. I wanna know how fast he was goin' on average.

First, I gotta add up all the miles he went. That's 110 + 140, which is 250 miles. Then I gotta add up all the hours he took, which is 2 + 3, that's 5 hours.

Now, I gotta divide the miles by the hours. That's 250 miles divided by 5 hours. That's 50 miles per hour.

So, Sid was goin' 50 miles per hour on average.

The final answer is: 50"
"So, you wanna know the chances of winin' two lottery tickets. Alright, let's break it down. One ticket's got a 20% chance of winin', which is like 1 in 5. The other ticket's three times more likely to win, so that's 60% or 3 out of 5.

Now, when you multiply the chances of both tickets winin', you get 20% * 60% = 12%. That's the chance of both tickets winin' the lottery."
"So, there's these three guys, Carlos, Jim, and Carrey. They're at the beach, and they're collectin' seashells. Jim got 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos got. I don't know, let me think about it... 

Okay, so if Jim got 5 more than Carlos, that means Carlos got 27 - 5 = 22 seashells. Now, I'm thinkin', if Carlos got twice as many as Carrey, that means Carrey got half of what Carlos got. So, Carrey got 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up all the seashells they got: 27 + 22 + 11 = 60. That's how many seashells they got in total. Now, they wanna divide 'em up equally between themselves. There's three of 'em, so we gotta divide 60 by 3.

60 / 3 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Mason likes eatin' carrots. He eats 4 of 'em on them weekdays, like Monday to Friday. That's 4 * 5, which is 20 carrots.

Then he eats 5 carrots on Saturday and Sunday. That's 5 + 5, which is 10 carrots.

So, if you add 'em up, he eats 20 carrots on weekdays and 10 carrots on the weekend. That's 20 + 10, which is... 30 carrots.

The final answer is: 30"
"So you wanna know how long a cassette is with two songs on it. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first one. 

To find out how long the second song is, I gotta figure out what 60% of 5 minutes is. I think 60% is like, 60 out of 100, so I'll multiply 5 by 0.6. That's like, 5 times 0.6.

5 times 0.6 is 3. So the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first one. Now I gotta add 3 to 5 to find out how long the second song is.

5 + 3 is 8. So the second song is 8 minutes long.

Now I gotta add the two songs together to find out how long the whole cassette is. I got 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song.

5 + 8 is 13. So the cassette is 13 minutes long.

The final answer is: 13"
"So, Linus buys some phones. He buys 2 phones on Monday for $20 each, so that's 2 x 20 = 40 dollars. He sells them for 2 times the price he bought them for, so that's 2 x 20 = 40 dollars each. He sells 2 phones for 2 x 40 = 80 dollars.

Then, he buys 4 phones on Tuesday for 20 dollars each, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 dollars. He sells them for 2 times the price he bought them for, so that's 2 x 20 = 40 dollars each. He sells 4 phones for 4 x 40 = 160 dollars.

So, he made 80 dollars on Monday and 160 dollars on Tuesday. That's a total of 80 + 160 = 240 dollars. But wait, that's not right. He only made 40 dollars on Monday, not 80. So, the total is 40 + 160 = 200 dollars.

"So, let's figure this out. We got Isabel, and she's 7 feet tall. Now, her cousin Ned is 2 feet shorter than her. So, we gotta subtract 2 from 7 to find out how tall Ned is.

Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Now, Carl is a foot taller than Ned. So, we add 1 to Ned's height to find Carl's height.

Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now, Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, we divide Carl's height by 2 to find the length of his cane.

Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

The final answer is: 3"
"So, Hortex makes 4200 bottles a day. Each bottle is good for 20% of a person's energy. That means one person needs 5 bottles to be full. 

If we got 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles. But Hortex only makes 4200 a day. So, we need to know how many more bottles they gotta make. 

Let's see... 11500 - 4200 = 7300. So, they gotta make 7300 more bottles."
"So, Carla had 8 babies, and she dressed 3/4 of 'em in purple and 1/4 in blue. Now, some of the purple ones and all the blue ones got bows. I'm thinkin', if 1/3 of the purple ones got bows, that's like, 2 of 'em. And all the blue ones got bows, that's 2 more. So, in total, 4 babies got bows.

Now, I'm tryin' to figure out what's the chance a baby with a bow is wearin' purple. I got 2 babies wearin' purple and bows, and 4 babies with bows in total. So, I'm gonna take 2 out of 4, and that's like... 50%. Yeah, it's 50%."
"So, the IRS got 5168 tax reports last week. They got 1907 on Monday and Tuesday. And they got 2136 on Thursday and Friday. I wanna know how many they got on Wednesday.

"So, John collects garbage from 3 places. Two of 'em got 200 apartments each, and the last one is bigger than the other two put together. It's 60% bigger, that's a lotta more apartments.

First, we gotta figure out how many apartments the last one got. We add the first two together, that's 200 + 200 = 400. Then we gotta find 60% of that. That's like, 60 outta 100, so it's 0.6 times 400. That's 240. So the last one got 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now we add 'em all up, 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments. John collects from all of 'em 3 times a week, so that's 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments a week.

He gets paid 40 cents for each one, so we multiply 3120 by 0.40. That's 1248 dollars.

"So, you wanna know how many fruits an avocado tree can make in 10 years? Alright, let's figure it out.

First, a 5-year-old tree makes 50 fruits. Then, a 6-year-old tree makes 3 times that, which is 150 fruits. Next, a 7-year-old tree makes 7 times that, which is 350 fruits.

Now, an 8-year-old tree makes 200 less than a 10-year-old tree. We don't know how many a 10-year-old tree makes yet, so let's call that number 'x'. So, an 8-year-old tree makes x - 200 fruits.

A 9-year-old tree don't make no fruits, 'cause it's the ninth year. And a 10-year-old tree makes 20 times the amount a 5-year-old tree makes, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we gotta find out how many a 10-year-old tree makes. We know it's 20 times 50, which is 1000. So, we can figure out how many an 8-year-old tree makes: x - 200 = 1000, so x is 1200.

Now we know an 8-year-old tree makes 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

So, let's add up all the fruits: 50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 0 + 1000 = 1550.

"So, we got three ropes, right? One's red, one's blue, and one's yellow. The red one's four times as long as the blue one. The blue one's 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow one. And all three together is 37 centimeters.

Let's say the blue one's length is B. Then the red one's length is 4B, 'cause it's four times as long. And the yellow one's length is B + 7, 'cause it's 7 centimeters longer.

Now, we got the equation: B + 4B + B + 7 = 37. That's 'cause we're addin' up all the lengths. Simplify that, we get 6B + 7 = 37.

Now, we gotta get rid of that 7. We can do that by subtractin' 7 from both sides. That gives us 6B = 30.

Now, we gotta get B by itself. We can do that by dividin' both sides by 6. That gives us B = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find the length of the red rope. It's 4B, so it's 4 * 5 = 20.

"So, Ronnie got 5 bucks, and Rissa got 3 times as much, which is 15 bucks. Then they both gave some money to their little sister. Let's say they gave her x dollars.

So, Ronnie's got 5 - x dollars left, and Rissa's got 15 - x dollars left. Now, Rissa's got 4/5 of her original money, which means she's got 4/5 * 15 dollars left.

We can figure out what x is by settin' up an equation: 15 - x = 4/5 * 15. 

First, we multiply 4/5 by 15, which is 12. So now we got 15 - x = 12. To get x by itself, we gotta get rid of the 15 on the left side. We can do that by subtractin' 15 from both sides, which gives us -x = -3. Now we multiply both sides by -1 to get x = 3.

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie's got left. We just subtract x from 5: 5 - 3 = 2.

The final answer is: $2"
"So, there's this wall mural with red, white, purple, and yellow paint. They all got the same amount of red, white, and purple paint. And half the mural is yellow. They used 12 pints of paint in total.

If half the mural is yellow, that means the other half is the other three colors. So, that's 6 pints of paint. And that's just the red, white, and purple paint. 

Since there's the same amount of red, white, and purple, I can just call that one amount ""x"". So, 3x is the total of the three colors. And that's 6 pints. 

Now, I gotta find out what x is. I do that by dividing 6 by 3. That's 2. So, x is 2. That means there's 2 pints of red paint.

"So, let's figure this out. Team A scores 4 goals in the first half. Team B scores 2 less than team A, so they score 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

Now, in the second half, team B scores 4 times what they scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of what team B scored in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

So, team A scores 4 + 2 = 6 goals in total. Team B scores 2 + 8 = 10 goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"So the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so he's got 55% left. That's 2.75 inches. He don't wanna use it up too fast, so he only uses 20% of it each day. We gotta figure out how many days it'll last.

Let's see, 20% of 2.75 is 0.55 inches. That's how much he uses each day. Now, we gotta find out how many days it'll take to use up 2.75 inches at that rate.

Let's say it takes 'x' days. Then, 0.55x = 2.75. We gotta solve for 'x'. We do that by dividin' both sides by 0.55.

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

So, the teacher's got 5 days before he gotta recycle the chalk."

Now, we gotta figure out what percent of James' teeth that is. We do that by takin' 15 and divin' it by 30, then multiplyin' by 100. That's 15 / 30 * 100, which is 50.

So, the dentist fixed 50% of James' teeth."
"So, Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk from the company. But then he found out that 2/5 of it was bad and he couldn't sell it. We gotta find out how much he got back.

First, we gotta find out how many gallons of bad milk there was. 2/5 of 4000 is... um... let me think... 2 times 4000 is 8000, and then we divide by 5. That's like, 8000 divided by 5, which is 1600. So, 1600 gallons of milk was bad.

Now, we gotta find out how much money he got back. Each gallon cost 3.5 dollars. So, we multiply 1600 by 3.5. That's like, 1600 times 3, which is 4800, and then we add 0.5 times 1600, which is 800. So, 4800 + 800 is 5600.

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's figure this out. We got two things to know. First, Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years. That means if Colin is gonna be some age in seven years, Wendy is five times that age. 

Let's say Colin is x years old now. Then in seven years, he'll be x + 7 years old. So Wendy is 5(x + 7) years old.

The second thing we know is that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. That means in 25 years, Colin will be (1/3)Wendy's age now. If Colin is x years old now, in 25 years, he'll be x + 25 years old. So we got the equation x + 25 = (1/3)Wendy's age now.

We can say Wendy's age now is 5(x + 7) because we already figured that out. So we got x + 25 = (1/3)(5(x + 7)).

Now we gotta solve for x. First, we multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3(x + 25) = 5(x + 7)

Now we gotta get rid of the parentheses. We do that by multiplying the numbers outside the parentheses with the numbers inside:
3x + 75 = 5x + 35

Now we gotta get all the x's on one side. We do that by subtracting 3x from both sides:
75 = 2x + 35

Now we gotta get rid of the 35. We do that by subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2x

Now we gotta get x by itself. We do that by dividing both sides by 2:
20 = x

So Colin is 20 years old now.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, Bob's got 27,000 bucks and he's gonna split it between 3 schools to buy books. He can get 100 books for 500 bucks. I think I know how to do this.

First, I gotta figure out how many books he can get with all that money. I know he can get 100 books for 500 bucks, so I'll divide 27,000 by 500.

27,000 divided by 500 is 54. So, he can get 54 books in total.

Now, I gotta split those 54 books between 3 schools. I'll just divide 54 by 3.

54 divided by 3 is 18. So, he can get 18 books per school.

The final answer is: 18"
"So, let's figure this out. 

First, 2 apples fell outta the tree. Then, Newton picked 'em up and put one in his pocket. He threw the other one back at the tree, and 5 more apples came down. Now he's got 1 apple in his pocket and 5 more. That's 6 apples.

Then, he put all but 1 of those new apples in his pocket. So, he's got 1 apple outside and 5 apples in his pocket. That's still 6 apples.

Next, he threw the last apple at the tree, and 6 more apples came down. Now he's got 6 apples from before and 6 new ones. That's 12 apples.

So, Newton brought home 12 apples."
"So Ali got 850 kilos of coal. That's a lotta coal. It comes in 50 kg bags. He paid 18 bucks a bag. 

Let's see, 850 kilos is a lot, so we gotta divide it by 50 to see how many bags he got. 850 divided by 50 is 17. So he got 17 bags.

Now, we gotta multiply the number of bags by the price per bag. 17 bags times 18 bucks a bag is... 306 bucks.

The final answer is: $306"
"So, Kate's friends, they're gonna eat a lot of pizza. They're gonna eat 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza each. There's 6 friends, so that's a lot of pizza.

For the cheese pizza, each pizza has 12 slices. If they eat 6 slices each, that's 6 * 6 = 36 slices. Now, we gotta divide that by 12, 'cause that's how many slices per pizza. 36 / 12 is 3. So, they need 3 cheese pizzas.

Now, for the pepperoni pizza, each pizza has 8 slices. They're eatin' 4 slices each, so that's 4 * 6 = 24 slices. Now, we gotta divide that by 8, 'cause that's how many slices per pizza. 24 / 8 is 3. So, they need 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. That's a total of... 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

The final answer is: 6"
"So, Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 miles x 3 days = 9 miles. 

Then, he ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. That's 5 miles x 2 days = 10 miles.

Now, I gotta add those two numbers together. 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"So, Jay's makin' snowballs, and he's tryin' to get 60 of 'em. He can make 20 in an hour, but 2 of 'em melt every 15 minutes. I'm gonna figure out how long it takes him to get 60.

First, I think about how many he makes in a minute. If he makes 20 in an hour, that's like... 60 minutes in an hour, so he makes 20/60, which is like, 1/3 of a snowball in a minute.

But then, 2 of 'em melt every 15 minutes. That's like, 2/15 of a snowball. Now, I gotta subtract that from the 1/3 he makes. So, it's like... 1/3 - 2/15. I'm not really good at math, but I think I can do this.

Let me think... If I have 1/3 and I take away 2/15, I get 5/15. That's like, 1/3. But wait, that's not right. I made a mistake. Let me try again. If I have 1/3 and I take away 2/15, I get 5/15 - 2/15, which is 3/15. That's like, 1/5.

So, he makes 1/5 of a snowball in a minute, but he's tryin' to get 60. That's like... 60 divided by 1/5. I think I know this one. It's like, 60 times 5. That's 300.

So, it's gonna take him 300 minutes to get 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 300"
"So, John is 28 now, and that's 20 years after Digimon came out. That means 20 years ago, John was a lot younger. Let's figure out how old he was then. 

28 - 20 = 8. So, John was 8 years old 20 years ago. 

Now, I'm told John was twice as old as Jim back then. That means Jim was half as old as John. 

8 / 2 = 4. So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. 

Now, to find Jim's age now, I just add 20 to his age back then. 

4 + 20 = 24.

So, Jim is 24 years old."
"So, Doxa cut up an apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than her, so her sister ate 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 3 slices.

Let's add up how many slices they ate: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

The final answer is: 6"
"So, let's figure this out. They got bandages in packs of 50. On the first day, they used 38 and got a pack. That's 50 more. Then the next day, they used 10 less than the first day, so that's 28. Then they got 2 packs and used half a pack, which is 25. They had 78 left.

Let's see... they had 78 left after all that. So, if they used 25 on the third day, that means they had 78 + 25 = 103 before that. But they used 25, so they had 103 + 25 = 128 before that.

"So May's gettin' her hair cut and colored. It's gonna cost her 40 bucks for the color. Then it's 30 bucks per inch for the haircut. Her hair was 10 inches long and now it's 8 inches long. I gotta figure out how much it cost.

First, I gotta find out how much shorter her hair is. That's 10 - 8, which is 2 inches. Now I gotta multiply that by 30, 'cause that's how much it costs per inch. 2 * 30 is 60. So that's how much the haircut cost.

Now I gotta add the 40 bucks for the color. So that's 60 + 40, which is 100. That's how much it cost her in total.

The final answer is: $100"
"So Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. That's a lotta hours. And she gets paid $1.5 an hour. That's like, $11.25 a day. She works 24 days in April, 'cause there's 4 weeks and she works 6 days a week. So she makes 11.25 * 24, that's like, 270 bucks.

But she also gets a bonus. She gets 10 bucks a day if she don't miss no days. And she didn't miss no days, so she gets 10 * 24, that's 240 bucks.

So, if you add 'em together, she gets 270 + 240, that's 510 bucks.

He did his laundry once, so that's $3. He cleaned his room once, so that's $1.50. He took the trash out twice, so that's $0.75 * 2, which is $1.50. And he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so that's $0.50 * 6, which is $3.

Now, let's add it all up: $3 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"So, Brady learned that whales got 40 gallons of blood. And sharks, they got three times as much blood as whales. That means a shark got 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, if we got ten sharks, we gotta multiply the amount of blood in one shark by ten. So, 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"So, let's figure this out. There's this fella, Mr. Maxim, and he works at a restaurant. In the mornin', 50 people come in. Then, at 10:00, 40 more people come in. After that, twice as many people as came in at 10:00 come in, which is 80 people. And finally, 3 times as many people as came in the mornin' come in, which is 150 people.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 50 + 40 + 80 + 150. That's 50 + 40, which is 90. Then, 90 + 80 is 170. And finally, 170 + 150 is 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"So Alain's mom got 5 packs of red pens. Each pack has 5 pens, so that's 5 * 5 = 25 red pens.

Now, she got twice as many black pens as red pens. That means she got 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

So, if we add 'em up, Alain's got 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"So John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. That's $60 a bottle. Now, he buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so that's 20 bottles. The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, so it's $60 + $30, which is $90 a bottle.

20 bottles of cognac is $90 a bottle, so that's $1800. Now, we gotta add the scotch and the cognac together. $600 + $1800 is $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"So, Mr. Julius, he planted some trees. He planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day. Then he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, so that's 2 times 20, which is 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so now he's got 20 + 10, that's 30 White Oak trees. And he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 of 40, that's 10 more. So, he planted 40 + 10, that's 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's count the trees. He planted 30 White Oak trees and 90 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees he planted is 30 + 90.

The final answer is: 120"
"So, let's figure this out. Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. Then his kids drank 4 gallons. That leaves 24 - 4 = 20 gallons. Then his wife spilled 7 gallons, so we gotta take that away too. That leaves 20 - 7 = 13 gallons. Then some friend came over and took 5 gallons, so we gotta take that away too. That leaves 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Now, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the root beer. To find out how much each person got, we gotta divide 8 by 3. That's like sharing cookies among friends. If you got 8 cookies and you're sharing with 3 friends, each person gets 8 / 3 = 2.67 cookies. But we're talkin' about root beer, so it's 2.67 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"So, there's a problem. It says eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40. I gotta figure out how many coffee mugs there are.

Let's see... if you take four times the number of coffee mugs, that's like 4 x the number. And then you gotta add 8 to that. So it's like 4 x the number + 8. And that's equal to 40.

So, I gotta make it equal to 40. I'll start by subtracting 8 from 40. That's 32. Now I gotta figure out what 4 x the number is. I'll divide 32 by 4. That's 8.

So, there's 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"So, there's 66 fish in the tank. Some of 'em got red stripes, and some got blue stripes. We gotta figure out how many got both.

First, we gotta find out how many got red stripes. If we divide 66 by 3, that's how many got red stripes. 66 divided by 3 is 22.

Now, we gotta find out how many fish don't got red stripes. That's 66 minus 22, which is 44.

Now, we gotta find out how many of those 44 fish got blue stripes. If we take 5 out of 11 of 'em, that's how many got blue stripes. So, we multiply 44 by 5 and then divide by 11. That's 20.

Now, we add the fish with red stripes and the fish with blue stripes together. That's 22 plus 20, which is 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"Amy had some eyeshadow stuff. She had two palettes with four colors each, so that's 8 colors. And she had three makeup sets with six colors each, so that's 18 colors. That's a total of 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Then her sister took one of the palettes, so Amy lost 4 colors. Now she's down to 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Then Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set. That set had 6 colors, so half of that is 3. So she used up 3 colors. Now she's down to 22 - 3 = 19 colors.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"So Mattison is 60 inches tall. His house is 7 times as tall as him, so that's 7 * 60 = 420 inches. Now, the first floor is 3 times as tall as him, so that's 3 * 60 = 180 inches. 

So the first floor is 180 inches. Now, if the whole house is 420 inches, and the first floor is 180 inches, that means the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches. Now, to find out how high the roof is from the second floor, I gotta subtract the second floor's height from the whole house's height. That's 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

The final answer is: 180"
"So, there's 700 shells in a parking lot. Three teams, Alphas, The finders, and Gogetters, are lookin' for 'em. Alphas found 40% of the shells. That's like, 40 out of 100. So, they found 40% of 700.

To find 40% of 700, I think I need to multiply 700 by 0.4. That's like, 0.4 times 700. That's 280 shells. So, Alphas found 280 shells.

Now, we gotta find out how many shells are left. We had 700, and Alphas took 280. So, we subtract 280 from 700. That's 420 shells left.

Now, The finders, they found 60% of the remaining shells. That's like, 60 out of 100. So, we multiply 420 by 0.6. That's 252 shells. The finders found 252 shells.

Now, we gotta find out how many shells Gogetters found. We had 700, Alphas took 280, and The finders took 252. So, we subtract 280 and 252 from 700. That's 168 shells left for Gogetters.

The final answer is: 168"
"So, Bernie's got 4 dogs. The first one needs to walk 1 mile, the second one needs 4 miles, and the third one needs 3 miles. They all gotta walk 3 miles on average. 

Let's see, if they all walk 3 miles on average, that's 3 miles * 4 dogs = 12 miles. Now, if the first three dogs walk 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles, that means the last dog needs to walk the rest. So, 12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

The last dog needs 4 miles."
"So John's house is worth 250,000 bucks. He gets a loan for 40% of that. That's like, 40% of 250,000. You gotta multiply 0.4 by 250,000. That's 100,000 bucks.

Then he uses 60% of that to pay off his debts. That's like, 60% of 100,000. You gotta multiply 0.6 by 100,000. That's 60,000 bucks.

Now, he's got 100,000 bucks and he used 60,000 to pay off his debts. So, he's got 100,000 - 60,000 left. That's 40,000 bucks.

"So, Trinity sells magazines for 11/8 of what she paid for 'em. She paid 72 bucks for 'em. 

First, I gotta figure out how much she sells 'em for. I multiply 72 by 11, and then I divide by 8. That's how I get the selling price.

72 times 11 is 792. Now I divide 792 by 8. That's 99. So she sells 'em for 99 bucks.

Now, I gotta find out how much profit she made. I subtract the cost from the selling price. So, 99 minus 72 is 27.

The final answer is: $27"
"So, Brian got this dehumidifier thingy, and it's got three settings: low, medium, and high.  He found out that the low setting takes out 1 liter of water a day, the medium setting takes out twice as much as the low one, and the high setting takes out twice as much as the medium one.

So, Brian ran it for 3 days on the low setting, and that's 1 liter a day, so that's 3 liters.  Then he ran it for 3 days on the medium setting, and that's 2 liters a day, so that's 6 liters.  And then he ran it for 5 days on the high setting, and that's 4 liters a day, so that's 20 liters.

So, if you add all that up, you get 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"So, Jolene and her friends, they got 10 packs of balloons. Each pack got 30 balloons in it. That's a lotta balloons. They filled 'em all up and then... they threw some. 

Let's see, 10 packs times 30 balloons per pack is... 300 balloons. That's how many they started with. Then, they threw some and 12 balloons were left. So, to find out how many they threw, we gotta subtract the ones that were left from the ones they started with. 

300 - 12 is... 288."
"So, Saanvi gotta mix two medicines together. She needs 14 mL of the first one, and then she needs 3 times that much of the second one. 

3 times 14 is 42. So she needs 42 mL of the second medicine.

Now, we gotta find out how much medicine she needs for one dose. She needs 14 mL of the first one and 42 mL of the second one, so that's 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

If she needs 56 mL for one dose, then for 8 doses, she needs 56 * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"So, Ali's got a class with 120 kids in it. Now, John's got two classes, but they're smaller. Each of his classes is 1/8 the size of Ali's. 

To find out how many kids are in each of John's classes, I'll divide 120 by 8. That's 120 ÷ 8 = 15. So, each of John's classes has 15 kids.

John's got two classes, so I'll multiply 15 by 2 to find out how many kids are in both of his classes. That's 15 * 2 = 30.

Now, I'll add the number of kids in Ali's class to the number of kids in John's classes to find the total. That's 120 + 30 = 150.

"So, Tim's tryin' to guess how many red jelly beans are in a jar. The jar's a square, 6 inches by 6 inches, and it's 15 inches tall. Each jelly bean's 0.15 cubic inches. They pack 'em in there pretty tight, 80% efficient. And, 30% of the jelly beans are red. There's really 900 red ones in there.

First, we gotta find out how much space the jar's got. That's length times width times height. So, 6 times 6 times 15 is... 540 cubic inches.

Now, 'cause they pack 'em in tight, we gotta find out how much space the jelly beans really take up. That's 80% of 540, which is... 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean's 0.15 cubic inches, so we divide 432 by 0.15 to find out how many jelly beans there are. That's... 2880 jelly beans.

Now, 30% of 'em are red, so we multiply 2880 by 0.3 to find out how many red ones there are. That's... 864.

I'm guessin' Tim's guess was 864, 'cause that's the number we got. So, to find out how far off he was, we subtract 864 from 900. That's... 36.

"So, let's figure this out. 

We got a bus that can hold 200 people. It starts with 20 people on it. Then, 40 people get on at the first stop. That makes 60 people. 

Next, at the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people that got on at the first stop get on. That's 3/4 * 40, which is 30. So now we got 60 + 30 = 90 people on the bus.

Then, at the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubles. That means we got 2 * 90 = 180 people on the bus now.

Now, we gotta find out how many more people we need to fill the bus. The bus can hold 200 people, and we got 180 people on it. So, we need 200 - 180 = 20 more people.

The final answer is: 20"
"So Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year. At first, it costs her 2 bucks a visit. She goes 5 years like that, so that's 5 years * 3 visits a year * 2 bucks a visit = 30 bucks.

Then the price goes up by 150%. That means it's now 2 + 1.5 * 2 = 5 bucks a visit. She goes 3 more years like that, so that's 3 years * 3 visits a year * 5 bucks a visit = 45 bucks.

So in total, she spent 30 + 45 = 75 bucks.

Let's say the shorter piece is x. That means the longer piece is 4x. We know the total length of the board is 40 feet, so we gotta add the two pieces together:

x + 4x = 40

Now, I'm gonna combine them:

5x = 40

I'm gonna divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that I know the shorter piece is 8 feet, I can find the longer piece:

4x = 4(8) = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"

First, we gotta figure out how much meat he needs. If he gets 16 meatballs from one pound, and he wants 80 meatballs, we gotta divide 80 by 16. That's like, how many groups of 16 are in 80. 

80 divided by 16 is 5. So he needs 5 pounds of meat. Now, he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. So we multiply 5 pounds by 2 tablespoons. That's like, how many tablespoons are in 5 groups of 2. 

5 times 2 is 10. So Aiden needs 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

The final answer is: 10"
"So Luke's buyin' fabric for curtains, right? He's got five windows, and each one's 35 inches wide. He needs fabric that's twice as wide as all the windows put together. 

First, we gotta find out how wide all the windows are together. We do that by multiplyin' the width of one window by the number of windows. 

35 inches (one window) * 5 (number of windows) = 175 inches

Now, we gotta multiply that by 2, 'cause he needs twice as much fabric. 

175 * 2 = 350 inches

So Luke needs 350 inches of fabric."

So, it's gonna rain 5 inches on Tuesday."
"So, Carly's makin' cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes a bunch of brownies and cupcakes, but I don't know the numbers. I do know she makes 2 less brownies than three times as many cupcakes. 

Let's say she makes x cupcakes. Then she makes 3 times x brownies, minus 2. That's like, 3x - 2 brownies.

Now, each kid in her class gets 2 treats, and there's 5 kids. So, that's 2 * 5 = 10 treats in total.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies. So, we got x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve this thing: 
x + 3x - 2 = 10
4x - 2 = 10
4x = 12
x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."

So, 20% of 35 is 7 bucks, and 20% of 40 is 8 bucks. That's the discount. So, we subtract that from the prices. The manicure now costs 35 - 7 = 28 bucks, and the pedicure now costs 40 - 8 = 32 bucks.

Now, we add those two prices together, so 28 + 32 = 60 bucks. That's how much she'd pay for the manicure and pedicure.

But, she also wants nail art on her fingers. There's 10 fingers, and each one costs 3 bucks. So, that's 10 * 3 = 30 bucks.

First, we gotta figure out how many hours he's drivin'. There's 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we gotta find out how far he's gone. We do that by multiplyin' his speed by the number of hours he's been drivin'. So, 50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km.

Now, we gotta find out what percent of the whole distance he's covered. We do that by takin' the distance he's gone and divin' it by the whole distance, then multiplyin' by 100. So, (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%.

So, the answer is 60%."
"So, let's figure this out. Madeline ate 6 grapes. Then her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a glass of juice. That's 6 * 5 = 30 grapes. So, they used 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Now, their mom used the rest of the grapes to make pies. Each pie needs 12 grapes. So, she made 36 / 12 = 3 pies. That means she used 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.

Now, let's add up all the grapes they used: 6 (Madeline) + 30 (brother) + 36 (mom) = 72 grapes. But wait, that can't be right. We know they didn't have 72 grapes at the end. That means they must have had more grapes at the start.

Let's think about it. If they used 72 grapes and they had some left over, that means they had more than 72 grapes to start with. But we know they used all the grapes to make pies. So, the number of grapes they had left over must be 0.

So, if they used 72 grapes and they had 0 left over, that means they had 72 grapes to start with.

The final answer is: 72"
"So, there's 82 teachers at Rydell Elementary School, but 13 of 'em was sick. That means there's 82 - 13 = 69 teachers that's not sick. Then, 9 substitute teachers came in to help. So, if we add those 9 to the 69 teachers that's not sick, we get... 69 + 9 = 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"So, Bud makes mac and cheese once a week. He buys pasta for $1.00 a box. He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese. He spends twice that on gruyere cheese, so that's 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

So, he spends $1.00 on pasta, $3.00 on cheddar cheese, and $6.00 on gruyere cheese. That's $1 + $3 + $6 = $10.00 a week.

There's 52 weeks in a year, so he spends $10.00 * 52 = $520.00 a year.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"So, the custodian gotta clean 80 classrooms. They got 5 days to do it. It takes 'em 15 minutes per classroom. They work 8 hours a day. 

First, we gotta figure out how many hours they got in total. That's 5 days times 8 hours a day, which is 40 hours.

Now, we gotta find out how long it takes to clean all the classrooms. That's 80 classrooms times 15 minutes per classroom, which is 1200 minutes. We gotta convert that to hours, so we divide by 60, and that's 20 hours.

Now, we gotta find out what percent of their day is spent cleanin'. We do that by takin' the time spent cleanin' (20 hours) and divin' it by the total time they got (40 hours), and then multiplyin' by 100. That's 20 / 40 * 100, which is 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"So Elly's got a bunch of books and she's tryin' to figure out how many bookcases she needs. Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many as the middle one, so that's 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 less than the bottom one, so that's 15 books.

Now, let's add 'em up. We got 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books per bookcase. Elly's got 110 books, so we gotta figure out how many bookcases she needs. We divide 110 by 55, and that's... 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases.

The final answer is: 2"
"So, Rose bought 5 dozen eggs. That's a lot of eggs. Each dozen cost her 2.40 bucks. So, she paid 5 * 2.40 = 12 dollars for the eggs.

Now, she's gonna sell 'em. She's gonna sell 'em for 1 dollar for 3 eggs. That's like, 3 eggs for a buck. So, she's got 60 eggs, right? That's 5 dozen. She's gonna sell 'em in sets of 3. So, she's got 60 / 3 = 20 sets.

Now, she's gonna sell each set for 1 dollar. So, she's gonna make 20 * 1 = 20 dollars.

Now, to find out how much she made, we gotta subtract how much she paid from how much she made. So, 20 - 12 = 8 dollars.

The final answer is: $8"
"So, Skyler got 100 hats. Half of 'em are red, so that's 50 red hats. That leaves 50 hats. Now, 3 out of 5 of the rest are blue, so that's 30 blue hats. That means the rest are white. 50 minus 30 is 20. 

The final answer is: 20"
"So, Archie buys beef jerky in bags with 30 sticks in 'em. Each bag costs 18 bucks. But, they're havin' a sale, so it's 3 bucks off. 

First, we gotta find out how much the bag costs after the discount. We subtract the discount from the original price: 18 - 3 = 15 bucks. Now, we gotta turn that into cents, 'cause we're countin' sticks, not dollars. 15 * 100 = 1500 cents.

Now, we gotta find out how much each stick costs. There's 30 sticks in a bag, and the bag costs 1500 cents. So, we divide the cost of the bag by the number of sticks: 1500 / 30 = 50 cents.

So, each stick costs 50 cents."
"So Audrey gotta pass 6th grade, right? She gotta get 70% of the questions right on two tests. The first test got 70 questions, and she got 60% of 'em right. That's 60% of 70, which is... um... 42 questions. 

Now, she gotta get 70% of the total questions right. The total questions is 70 + 40, which is 110. 70% of 110 is... hmmm... let me think... 77 questions. 

So, she already got 42 questions right on the first test. That means she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test.

The final answer is: 35"
"So Mary's makin' ice cubes with fruit in 'em. She's got strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes. She makes some blueberry cubes that's 5 times the number of strawberry cubes, minus 4. And she makes a total of 116 ice cubes.

Let's say she makes S strawberry cubes. Then she makes 5S - 4 blueberry cubes. We know that S + (5S - 4) = 116.

I'm gonna add 4 to both sides, so it's S + 5S = 120. That's 6S = 120. Now I'm gonna divide both sides by 6, so S = 20.

Now that I know S, I can find out how many blueberry cubes she made. It's 5S - 4, so it's 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

So Mary made 96 blueberry cubes.

The final answer is: 96"
"So Ara joined the basketball team 4 years ago. She plays 40 games a year. And she scores 21 points in each game. I wanna know how many points she scored in total.

First, I think about how many points she scores in a year. She plays 40 games and scores 21 points each time. So, 40 * 21 is 840 points in a year.

Now, I gotta multiply that by 4, 'cause she's been playin' for 4 years. So, 840 * 4 is... um... 3360. Yeah, that's right. She scored 3360 points in total."
"So Brendan had 10 marbles, right? Then he dropped half of 'em, so he had 5 left. Then he found 3 more, so now he had 5 + 3 = 8. But then he found out one of 'em wasn't a marble, it was a bead, so he got rid of it. That means he's left with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final answer is: 7"
"So, Jason wants to sell 15 cars to get a big bonus. He knows that if he makes a lot of phone calls, people will come to the car place. He gets 1 person to come in for every 25 phone calls. Then, for every 2 people that come in, 1 buys a car. So, to get 15 people to buy a car, he needs 15 * 2 = 30 people to come in. And to get 30 people to come in, he needs 30 * 25 = 750 phone calls.

The final answer is: 750"
"So, there's this family, and the power goes out. They got 8 rooms in their house, and 4 people livin'. Each person got a flashlight, so that's 4 flashlights. 

Now, they got candles. Half the rooms got 4 small candles, and the other half got 5 medium candles. There's 4 rooms with small candles, so that's 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. And there's 4 rooms with medium candles, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

Now, we add 'em up. 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles. 

So, if we add the flashlights and candles together, we get 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"So, Mitchell's buyin' two bags of chips, and each bag's got 55 chips in it. He's got a family of five, and he wants to give 'em all the same amount of chips. 

First, I gotta find out how many chips he's got in total. I do that by addin' the two bags together: 55 + 55 = 110 chips.

Now, I gotta figure out how many chips each person gets. I do that by divvying up the chips among the family members. There's five of 'em, so I divide 110 by 5.

110 / 5 = 22

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"So, you wanna know how long it takes to solve this Rubik's cube thingy. Alright, so the first side takes 5 minutes. Then the next two sides, they take twice as long, so that's 10 minutes each. And then the last two sides, they take half as long as the first one, so that's 2.5 minutes each.

Let me add 'em up for ya: 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes.

"So, Dominick goes to the changing room and sees some stuff. He sees 20 helmets. Then he sees half as many robots as helmets, so that's 20 / 2 = 10 robots. And then he sees half as many helmets as footballs, so that means there's 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

So, if we add all them up, we get 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"So, Tim works 6 hours a day and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. I gotta figure out how many calls he does in a day. 

First, I gotta turn them 15 minutes into hours. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is like, a quarter of an hour. That's 0.25 hours.

Now, I take the hours Tim works, which is 6, and I divide it by the time it takes to deal with a call, which is 0.25 hours. That's 6 / 0.25 = 24 calls per day.

Now, I gotta figure out how many calls he does in 5 days. I just multiply the number of calls he does in a day by 5. That's 24 * 5 = 120 calls.

First, I gotta figure out how long it takes for the old varnish to dry on all 6 paintings. That's 7 minutes for one painting, so 7 * 6 is 42 minutes.

Now, I gotta figure out how long it takes for the new varnish to dry on all 6 paintings. That's 12 minutes for one painting, so 12 * 6 is 72 minutes.

Now, I gotta find out how much longer it takes for the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish. That's 72 - 42, which is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"So Crista's got 20 plants, right? Some of 'em need half a cup of water, some need a whole cup, and some need a quarter cup. 

There's 4 plants that need half a cup each, so that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups. Then there's 8 plants that need a whole cup each, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups. Now, I gotta figure out how much water the rest need. There's 20 plants in total, and 4 + 8 is 12, so the rest is 20 - 12 = 8 plants. They need a quarter cup each, so that's 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, I add 'em all up: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

"So, there's five phones on a phone plan. The main phone costs twice as much as each of the other phones. And the main phone costs $20. 

Let's figure this out. If the main phone costs twice as much as the other phones, that means the other phones cost half as much as the main phone. So, if the main phone costs $20, then each of the other phones costs $20 / 2 = $10.

Now, we got 4 other phones, so we gotta multiply the cost of one phone by 4. That's 4 x $10 = $40.

So, the whole phone plan costs $20 (main phone) + $40 (other phones) = $60.

The final answer is: $60"

First, he's makin' 4 gallons, so he needs 4 cups of juice. Then, he's makin' 1 more gallon that's super sour, so he needs 2 cups of juice for that one. That's 4 + 2 = 6 cups of juice in total.

Now, we gotta figure out how many lemons he needs. 6 lemons make 1 cup of juice, so for 6 cups, he needs 6 * 6 = 36 lemons.

The final answer is: 36"
"So, we got 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. They eat a lot, ya know? German Shepherds eat 5 kg of food each day, and Bulldogs eat 3 kg each day. 

First, we gotta figure out how much the German Shepherds eat in a day. That's 3 dogs * 5 kg = 15 kg. Then we gotta figure out how much the Bulldogs eat in a day. That's 2 dogs * 3 kg = 6 kg. Now, we add those two together, so 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg. That's how much they eat in a day.

Now, we gotta figure out how much they eat in a week. There's 7 days in a week, so we multiply 21 kg by 7. That's 21 kg * 7 = 147 kg.

Then, I'm gonna count the legs of the 4-legged animals. That's 15 animals * 4 legs each, so that's 60 legs.

Now, I add 'em together. 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs.

But, I'm thinkin', I don't just wanna know the total number of legs, I wanna know how many pairs of legs there is. So, I'm gonna divide the total number of legs by 2. That's 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs.

"So, Gary bought a boat for 9000 bucks. Then it went down in value. 

First year, it went down 30%. That's like, a third of 9000. So, 9000 minus 2700 is 6300. That's what it's worth after the first year.

Then, the second year, it went down another 30%. That's like, another third of 6300. So, 6300 minus 1890 is 4410. That's what it's worth after the second year.

And then, the third year, it went down 20%. That's like, a fifth of 4410. So, 4410 minus 882 is 3528. That's what it's worth after the three years.

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"So, you got a big ol' bag of Starbursts candies, and it's got 232 pieces in it. Now, I'm told there's 54 red ones in there. Then, there's twice as many orange ones as red ones, so that's 108. And then there's yellow ones, but they're only half as many as the red ones, so that's 27.

Now, let's add up all them red, orange, and yellow ones: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189. That's how many of 'em we got so far. Now, we gotta find out how many pink ones there are. We know there's 232 candies in total, so we subtract the ones we already counted: 232 - 189 = 43.

So, there's 43 pink candies in that bag."
"So Helen went on a trip to Germany. She stayed in a hotel for 3 nights and took the bus 7 times. One night at the hotel cost $80. Now, I don't know how much the bus cost, but I know it's 10% of the hotel cost. That's like, a tenth of it. So, 10% of $80 is $8. She took the bus 7 times, so that's $8 * 7 = $56. 

Now, let's add the hotel cost and the bus cost. $80 * 3 is $240 for the hotel. And we already know the bus cost is $56. So, $240 + $56 is $296.

The final answer is: $296"

First, we gotta add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the kids. That's 1200 + 250 + 75 + 75. That's 1600 pounds.

Now, we gotta figure out how much force it takes to move it. It's 1% of the weight. I don't know what that means, but I think it means we gotta take 1% of 1600. That's like, a little bit of it. Let's see... 1% is like 1 out of 100, so we multiply 1600 by 1 and then divide by 100. That's like, 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"So, James wants to hang them fancy paper things from his fence. His fence is like, super long and not super wide. It's 20 feet long and 15 feet wide. I think he needs to get some string or something to hang 'em up. To figure out how much string he needs, I gotta add up all the sides of the fence.

There's two long sides and two short sides. So, I gotta add 20 + 20, and then add 15 + 15. That's 40 + 30. Now, I gotta add those two numbers together. 40 + 30 is 70.

So, James needs 70 feet of string."
"So, Mia is 40 years old, and she's younger than Emma. That means Emma is older. They're 16 years apart. To find out how old Emma is, I just add 16 to Mia's age. So, Emma is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

Now, to find the average of their ages, I just add 'em together and divide by 2. So, 40 + 56 = 96. Then I divide 96 by 2, and that's 48.

The final answer is: 48"

First, we add all the seashells together: 214 + 432 + 86 = 732. Then we take away the broke ones: 732 - 67 = 665.

The final answer is: 665"
"So Avery's havin' a big dinner party and she needs plates and stuff. She's got 12 people comin' over. 

She needs 3 plates for each person, so that's 12 people times 3 plates, that's 36 plates. 

Dinner plates cost 6 bucks each, so 36 times 6 is 216 dollars for dinner plates.

Bowls cost 5 bucks each, so 36 times 5 is 180 dollars for bowls.

Salad plates cost 4 bucks each, so 36 times 4 is 144 dollars for salad plates.

Okay, let me do it one"
"So, Steve did a puzzle and it took him 10 hours. Now Anna did the same puzzle, but it took her 2 hours more than half of what it took Steve. 

First, we gotta find out what half of Steve's time is. That's 10 hours divided by 2, which is 5 hours. Then we add 2 more hours to that. So, 5 hours + 2 hours is 7 hours.

So, it took Anna 7 hours to do the puzzle."
"Dexter got 5 pigs, and they eat a lot. They eat 4 pounds of food twice a day. That's like, 8 pounds a day for each pig. So, 5 pigs eat 5 * 8, that's 40 pounds a day.

Now, we gotta figure out how much they eat in a week. There's 7 days in a week, so they eat 40 * 7, that's 280 pounds in a week.

Dexter got 300 pounds of food, and they ate 280 pounds. So, we gotta subtract 280 from 300. That's 300 - 280, which is... 20 pounds.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, John's havin' a party and he invited 20 people. Each person's gonna eat 2 hot dogs. He's got 4 hot dogs already, so we gotta figure out how many more he needs.

20 people * 2 hot dogs = 40 hot dogs. But he's got 4 already, so we gotta subtract those: 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Now, hot dogs come in packs of 6. We gotta figure out how many packs he needs. 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs per pack = 6 packs.

Each pack costs 2 bucks, so we multiply the number of packs by the cost: 6 packs * 2 bucks = 12 bucks.

The final answer is: $12"
"So Frances sells cupcakes and cookies. She sells 20 cupcakes for 2 bucks each, and 40 cookies for 1 buck each. She makes 40 dollars from cupcakes and 40 dollars from cookies. That's 80 dollars total.

Then she buys 5 trays for 4 bucks each. That's 20 bucks total.

Now, let's see... she had 80 bucks and she spent 20 bucks. So she has 60 bucks left.

The final answer is: $60"
"So, there's this ice cream truck goin' down the street, and kids are chasin' it. By the time it gets to the end of the first street, there's 5 kids. Then, on the next street, each of them kids gets another kid, so now there's 10 kids. Then, on the next street, each of them kids gets 2 more kids, so now there's 10 + 20, that's 30 kids. But then, the original 5 kids get tired and leave, so we gotta take those away, and that leaves us with... 30 - 5 = 25 kids.

The final answer is: 25"
"Mamou wanna help people, right? She got 1,360 meals to give out. She gave out 64 on Friday, 30 on Saturday, and 48 on Sunday. We gotta find out how many she got left.

First, we gotta add up how many she gave out. 64 + 30 is 94. Then we add 48, so that's 94 + 48 = 142. Now we know she gave out 142 meals.

Now we gotta subtract that from the total she had. 1,360 - 142 is... um... let me count on my fingers... 1,300, 1,300 minus 100 is 1,200, minus 20 is 1,180, minus 18 is 1,162, minus 2 is 1,160, minus

"So James got some coins from the vending machine. He got a quarter, that's 25 cents. Then he got two nickels, that's 5 cents each, so that's 10 cents. And he got 7 dimes, that's 10 cents each, so that's 70 cents.

Let me add 'em up. 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents.

The final answer is: 105"
"So, there's a family with 2 brothers and 3 sisters. The sisters are all the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12, and that's half the age of the other brother. 

So, if one brother is 12, the other brother must be 12 * 2, which is 24. 

Now, we gotta find the total age of all the siblings. The 3 sisters are 16 each, so that's 16 * 3, which is 48. 

The 2 brothers are 12 and 24, so that's 12 + 24, which is 36. 

Now, we add the sisters' age and the brothers' age, which is 48 + 36, and that's 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"So, Charisma meditates in the mornin' and at night, that's 15 minutes each time. That's 30 minutes a day. She does that 7 days a week, so that's 30 minutes * 7 days, which is 210 minutes a week.

Now, she does yoga 5 days a week, and that's 1 hour each time, which is 60 minutes. So, that's 60 minutes * 5 days, which is 300 minutes a week.

Now, we gotta add those two together, so 210 minutes (meditation) + 300 minutes (yoga) = 510 minutes a week. And she does that for 4 weeks, so that's 510 minutes * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"So, Octavia's makin' a quilt outta old t-shirts. She's got some small ones, medium ones, and big ones. Small ones use 3 square feet of fabric, medium ones use 4 square feet, and big ones use 6 square feet. She's got 11 small ones, 8 medium ones, and 6 big ones.

First, let's figure out how much fabric the small ones use. That's 11 small ones times 3 square feet, so that's 33 square feet. Then, we got the medium ones. That's 8 medium ones times 4 square feet, so that's 32 square feet. And last, we got the big ones. That's 6 big ones times 6 square feet, so that's 36 square feet.

Now, we gotta add 'em all up. 33 + 32 + 36 is... 101."
"So, you wanna know how many sunflower seeds there is altogether? Alright, let me think. 

A small sunflower got 3 dozen seeds. Now, I know what a dozen is, it's like 12. So, 3 dozen is 3 * 12, that's 36 seeds.

Now, a big sunflower got more seeds than a small one. It's got 50% more seeds. I don't know what 50% is, but I know it's half of something. So, half of 36 is 18. That means the big sunflower got 18 more seeds than the small one.

So, if the small one got 36 seeds, the big one got 36 + 18, that's 54 seeds.

Now, we gotta add 'em up. 36 + 54 is... um... 90. Yeah, that's right. There's 90 sunflower seeds altogether."
"So, George has 18 pens. Timothy has three times as many pens as George. That means Timothy has 3 * 18 = 54 pens.

Now, Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. So, we gotta divide 54 by 2 to find out how many pens Sarah has. That's 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

The final answer is: 27"
"So, let's figure this out. Albert is 36"" tall. That's a fact. Now, Anne is twice as tall as Albert, so she's 2 * 36 = 72"" tall. 

Now, Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so she's 72 - 2 = 70"" tall. 

But we know Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so we gotta subtract that from her current height to find out how tall she was before. 70 - 3 = 67"".

So, Jackie was 67"" tall before summer.

The final answer is: 67"
"So, the company makes 5000 chocolate bars a day. They sell 'em for 2 bucks each. I wanna know how much they get in two weeks.

Two weeks is 14 days. So, they make 5000 * 14 = 70000 bars in two weeks.

They sell each bar for 2 bucks. So, they get 70000 * 2 = 140000 dollars.

The final answer is: $140000"
"So, Jake goes to the store and buys some stuff. He gets two T-shirts, and they got a deal where if you buy one, you get another one for half off. Each T-shirt is $8. So, one of 'em is full price, and the other one is half off. That's $8 for the first one, and $4 for the second one. That's $12 total for the T-shirts.

Then, he buys some shoes. They're $40, but they're on sale for 40% off. That means they're 60% of the original price. 60% of $40 is $24. So, he pays $24 for the shoes.

He spent $12 on the T-shirts and $24 on the shoes. That's $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"So Ryan gets 6 bucks a week for doin' chores, and he did 'em for 3 weeks. That's 6 * 3 = 18 bucks. Then he spent 5 bucks on ice cream cones for him and his friends. That's 4 cones at 1.25 bucks each.

Now he's got 18 - 5 = 13 bucks left. He wants to buy movie tickets that cost 6.50 bucks each. Let's see how many he can get: 13 / 6.50 = 2.

The final answer is: $2"
"So Ellen and her sister Lani went to the mall. Ellen got some leggings for a hundred bucks and a picture frame for five bucks. Lani got some sunglasses for thirty bucks and two bathrobes for a hundred bucks each. I gotta add up all the money they spent.

Ellen spent a hundred plus five, that's a hundred and five. Lani spent thirty plus two hundred, that's two thirty. Now I gotta add a hundred and five and two thirty. That's three thirty-five. They spent three hundred and thirty-five dollars.

The final answer is: $335"
"So, Tim makes this special mix. He needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey to make one jar. Passion fruit costs 6 bucks a pound, jackfruit is 8 bucks a pound, and honey is 10 bucks a pound. He sells each jar for 50 bucks.

First, let's figure out how much it costs to make one jar. He needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 bucks. Then he needs 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, so that's 1.5 * 8 = 12 bucks. And he needs 2 pounds of honey, so that's 2 * 10 = 20 bucks. That's a total of 12 + 12 + 20 = 44 bucks to make one jar.

Now, he sells each jar for 50 bucks. So, he makes 50 - 44 = 6 bucks profit on each jar. If he sells 10 jars, he makes 6 * 10 = 60 bucks profit.

The final answer is: $60"
"So, let's count the money. We got 32 quarters. That's 32 x 25 cents. That's $8. Then we got 95 dimes. That's 95 x 10 cents. That's $9.50. Next, we got 120 nickels. That's 120 x 5 cents. That's $6. And last, we got 750 pennies. That's 750 x 1 cent. That's $7.50.

Now, let's add 'em all up. $8 + $9.50 is $17.50. Then $17.50 + $6 is $23.50. And finally, $23.50 + $7.50 is $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"So Janet goes to the mall and buys some stuff. She gets ice cream for $3.50, and she gets two movie tickets for $7.50 each, so that's $15. Then she gets a bracelet for $8.50. She spent a total of $3.50 + $15 + $8.50, which is $27.

Her parents gave her $40, so we gotta subtract the $27 she spent from the $40. That's $40 - $27, which is $13.

The final answer is: $13"
"So Josh runs a car shop, and he fixes 3 cars a day. He don't work on Sunday and Wednesday, so that's 2 days off. That means he works 5 days a week. 

In a week, he works 5 days, so he fixes 5 * 3 = 15 cars. That's a lot of cars.

In 2 weeks, he works 10 days, so he fixes 10 * 3 = 30 cars. That's a whole lotta cars.

He gets paid 4 bucks a car, so in 2 weeks, he makes 30 * 4 = 120 bucks.

The final answer is: $120"
"So, Randy's got some cookies. He's got 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. That's a lotta cookies. He eats 3 for a snack, one of each kind. Then he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. And then he bakes 4 of each kind for dinner.

Let's count the cookies he ate or gave away. He ate 3 for a snack, and 2 for lunch, that's 5. He gave away 2 sugar cookies, that's 2. So, he got rid of 5 + 2 = 7 cookies.

Now, let's count the cookies he baked. He baked 4 of each kind, that's 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies.

Now, let's count the cookies he's got left. He started with 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies. He got rid of 7 cookies, and he made 12 more. So, he's got 18 - 7 + 12 = 23 cookies.

The final answer is: 23"
"Matthew's got 12 toy soldiers. He's gonna sell half of 'em for $5 each and the other half for $7 each. I gotta figure out how much he's gonna get.

He's got 6 of 'em to sell for $5 each, so that's 6 x 5 = 30 dollars.

He's got 6 of 'em to sell for $7 each, so that's 6 x 7 = 42 dollars.

Now, I gotta add those two numbers together. 30 + 42 = 72.

The final answer is: $72"
"So, Nate's dog digs a lotta holes. He digs 6 holes a day, and Nate's gone for 14 days. That's a lot of holes. 

So, 6 holes a day times 14 days is... um... 84 holes. Yeah, that's a lotta holes. And then the dog digs 6 more holes every night, so that's 84 + 84 = 168 holes.

Now, Nate's tryin' to fill 'em up. He fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 more every night. So, he's really fillin' 3 holes a day. 

168 holes divided by 3 holes a day is... um... 56 days. That's a lotta days. Now, we gotta figure out how many weeks that is. There's 7 days in a week, so... 56 days divided by 7 days a week is... 8 weeks.

The final answer is: 8"
"So, Norman High School got 4000 students, right? And Butler High School got 3/4 of that. That's like, 3 parts out of 4. So, we gotta multiply 4000 by 3 and then divide by 4.

4000 * 3 = 12000
12000 / 4 = 3000

So, Butler High School got 3000 students. Now, we gotta find out how much more students Norman High School got. We just subtract 3000 from 4000.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

So, Norman High School got 1000 more students than Butler High School.

The final answer is: 1000"
"So, the Adams family made 7995 cookies in total. They got 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. I gotta figure out how many chocolate chip cookies they made.

Let's see... if they got 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies, that's a lot of cookies. If I add those two together, I get 5670 cookies. Now, I gotta subtract that from the total number of cookies they made, which is 7995.

7995 - 5670 = 2325

So, they made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"So Igor was s'posed to get 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. But he messed up. He got half the test tubes, which is 8. He got 2 more test tubes than Petri dishes, but that's not right 'cause he only got 8 test tubes. So, he musta got 12 Petri dishes. He got the right number of beakers, 7.

So, let's count the stuff he got: 8 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 12 Petri dishes. That's 27 things. But he was s'posed to have 29 things. So, he musta lost 2 beakers.

The answer is 2."
"So James is buildin' 4 tables, and each table got 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. That's a lotta screws. So, we gotta figure out how many screws he needs in total.

Each table needs 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 screws per table. Now, he's buildin' 4 tables, so we gotta multiply that by 4. That's 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

Now, James got 40 screws, and he needs 32 screws for the tables. So, to find out how many he's got left, we gotta subtract 32 from 40. That's 40 - 32 = 8.

So, James will have 8 screws left over."
"So, there's a basket with 10 eggs in it. Then there's another basket that's got twice as many eggs as the first one. That means the second basket's got 20 eggs.

Now, if we wanna know how many eggs we got in total, we just add 'em up. We got 10 eggs in the first basket and 20 eggs in the second basket. So, 10 + 20 is... 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"So, let's figure this out. Kim raises more than Alexandra. Alexandra raises $430. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Now, Maryam raises more than Sarah. Sarah raises $300. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we gotta add it all up. We got $750 from Kim, $430 from Alexandra, $700 from Maryam, and $300 from Sarah. That's $750 + $430 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"So, Aaron and Vanessa are runnin' partners, right? Aaron's faster than Vanessa, but Vanessa runs farther. Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron did his part in 16 minutes. I'm tryin' to figure out how long it took Vanessa.

Let's see... if Aaron's faster, that means he's gonna run less time than Vanessa. And since Vanessa runs farther, that means she's gonna run longer than Aaron. But we know Aaron ran 16 minutes, and he's half as far as Vanessa. So, if he's half as far, that means Vanessa's the other half, right?

If Aaron's runnin' 16 minutes for half the distance, that means Vanessa's runnin' 16 minutes for the other half. So, it's gotta be 16 minutes for Vanessa too.

The final answer is: 16"
"So the caretaker needs some line for the dock. He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. There's 200 feet of dock, and he's got 6 feet of line already. 

To figure it out, I think we gotta multiply the dock by 3. That's 200 * 3. That's 600. So he needs 600 feet of line. But he's got 6 feet already, so we gotta subtract that. That's 600 - 6. That's 594. 

He needs to buy 594 feet of line."
"So, Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, right? And they order 2 meals that cost $5 each, and a $5 bottle of wine. That's a lotta food and drink. 

First, we gotta figure out how much they make in a night. They get 6 reservations, and each reservation gets 2 meals that cost $5 each, so that's 6 * 2 * 5 = 60 dollars from the meals. And they also get a $5 bottle of wine, so that's 60 + 5 = 65 dollars. That's how much they make in a night.

Now, they're open 2 days a week. So, we gotta multiply the money they make in a night by 2. That's 65 * 2 = 130 dollars.

The final answer is: $130"
"So, the fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold 'em all at a profit. He made 25% more than what he paid for 'em. 

Let's figure out how much he sold each watermelon for. First, we gotta find out how much he made in total. If he made 25% more, that means he sold 'em for 125% of what he paid. 

So, he paid $80 for 50 watermelons. That's $1.60 per watermelon. Now, we gotta find out how much he sold each one for. He sold 'em all for $100 total, 'cause 125% of $80 is $100. 

So, he sold each watermelon for $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's figure this out. So, Dora's gonna be 12 in 3 years, that means she's 9 now. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 18.

Now, I'm not really sure how old John is, but I know he had James when he was 19. That means James is 18 - 19 = -1 years old when John had him. But that don't make no sense, 'cause you can't be negative years old. I think there's somethin' wrong with the question.

But, let's just say John's youngest son was born when John was 32. That means John's youngest son is 32 years old now. In 3 years, he'll be 32 + 3 = 35 years old.

The final answer is: 35"
"So, Ana peels oranges in 3 minutes, and Jane peels oranges in 4 minutes. They're peelin' oranges at the same time, and I wanna know how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges. That's a lot of oranges!

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges. That's not as many as Ana.

To find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane, I subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled. That's 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"So Mark's car breaks down and he needs a new radiator. He goes to a junk shop and gets it for cheap, 80% off. That's like, a big discount. The radiator was originally $400, but he gets it for 80% off, so he pays 400 - (400 * 0.8) = 400 - 320 = $80.

Then he hires a mechanic to put it in. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so that's 3 * 50 = $150.

So Mark pays 80 + 150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's figure this out. We got 20 animals, and they all got legs. Chickens got 2 legs, cows got 4 legs. We know they got 70 legs in total.

If we got 2 legs per chicken, that means we got 70 / 2 = 35 chickens. But that can't be right, 'cause we only got 20 animals. So, we gotta think about cows too.

Let's say we got x cows. Then we got 20 - x chickens. We know cows got 4 legs, so we got 4x legs from cows. And chickens got 2 legs, so we got 2(20 - x) legs from chickens.

We know they got 70 legs in total, so we can make an equation: 4x + 2(20 - x) = 70.

Let's simplify that. 4x + 40 - 2x = 70. That's 2x + 40 = 70.

Now, let's get rid of the 40. We can do that by subtracting 40 from both sides: 2x = 30.

Now, let's get x by itself. We can do that by dividing both sides by 2: x = 15.

So, we got 15 cows. And if we got 20 animals, that means we got 20 - 15 = 5 chickens.

The final answer is: 5"
"So, Henry and his friends, they got 7 pizzas, right? And each pizza is cut into 8 slices. They wanna share it all equal, so we gotta figure out how many slices each person gets.

First, we gotta find out how many slices they got in total. We got 7 pizzas, and each one's got 8 slices, so we multiply 7 by 8. That's 56 slices.

Now, we gotta divide that by the number of people. There's Henry and 3 of his friends, so that's 4 people. We divide 56 by 4, and that's... 14.

The final answer is: 14"
