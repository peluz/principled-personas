"Let's figure out how much money Janet makes at the farmers' market.

Janet lays 16 eggs every day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins. To find out how many eggs she uses, we add 3 + 4, which is 7 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many eggs are left. We subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each. To find out how much money she makes, we multiply the number of eggs left by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

So, Janet makes $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To make a robe, you need 2 bolts of blue fiber. But you also need half that much white fiber. Half of 2 is 1, so you need 1 bolt of white fiber.

So, to make a robe, you need 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber. Let's add them together:

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"So Josh bought a house for $80,000 and then put in $50,000 in repairs. This made the house worth 150% more than it was before. 

To find out how much the house is worth now, we need to multiply the original price by 2.5 (since 100% + 150% = 250%, or 2.5 times the original). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5
New value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"Let's figure out how many meters James runs in a week. He runs 3 sprints 3 times a week. Each sprint is 60 meters. 

To find out how many meters he runs in one session, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint. So, 3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session.

Now, we need to find out how many sessions he runs in a week. He runs 3 sessions a week. To find the total meters he runs in a week, we multiply the meters he runs in one session by the number of sessions he runs in a week. So, 180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to know how much feed she gives them in total and how much she gives them per meal.

Wendi has 20 chickens, and she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal. So, the total number of cups of feed she gives per meal is 20 chickens * 3 cups = 60 cups.

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives them 25 cups of feed. To find out how many cups of feed she needs to give them in the final meal, we need to add the morning and afternoon feed together: 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

Now, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to find the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8, which is 0.6 * $1.8 = $1.08. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time. 

Let's list the cost of the glasses: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017949504, $0.0107949304, $0.00648696024, $0.003876582144, $0.0023259456896.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.0107949304 + $0.00648696024 + $0.003876582144 + $0.0023259456896 = $23.016

The total cost is $23.016."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know that Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so we multiply 20 by 4 to find out how many sheep Charleston has. 20 * 4 = 80.

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we multiply 80 by 2 to find out how many sheep Toulouse has. 80 * 2 = 160.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together. 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's figure out how long it takes Carla to download the file.

First, we need to find out how long it takes to download 40% of the file. Since the file is 200 GB and Carla can download 2 GB per minute, we need to find 40% of 200 GB. To do that, we multiply 200 by 0.4 (which is the same as 40%).

200 * 0.4 = 80 GB

So, Carla needs to download 80 GB. To find out how long it takes, we divide 80 by 2 (since she can download 2 GB per minute).

80 / 2 = 40 minutes

Now, we need to add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file and the time it takes to install the updates. The updates take 20 minutes.

40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

But we're not done yet! Carla has to start over from the beginning, so she has to download the whole file again. We already know it takes 40 minutes to download 40% of the file, so it takes 60 minutes to download the whole file. We just need to add that to the 60 minutes we already calculated.

60 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down John's trip into smaller parts to figure out how far he is from home at the end of 4 hours.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. But, he gets stuck in traffic for 2 hours. Since he's not moving, he doesn't travel any distance during this time.

Next, John drives for half an hour at 30 miles per hour. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

After that, John drives for the remaining 2 hours at 80 miles per hour. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Now, let's add up the distances John traveled in the return trip:

15 miles + 160 miles = 175 miles

So, John traveled a total of 180 miles away from home initially and 175 miles back. To find the distance he is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to subtract the distance he traveled back from the distance he traveled away:

Distance from home = Distance away - Distance back
Distance from home = 180 - 175
Distance from home = 5 miles

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much Eliza earned this week, we need to do some math. 

First, let's figure out how much she made for the first 40 hours she worked. Since she makes $10 per hour, we multiply 40 hours by $10. That's 40 x 10 = $400.

Now, let's find out how much she made for the extra hours she worked. She worked a total of 45 hours, and we already know she worked 40 hours, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 extra hours. Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular pay, which is 1.2 x $10 = $12 per hour. So, for the extra 5 hours, she made 5 x $12 = $60.

To find out her total earnings, we add the money she made for the first 40 hours and the extra hours. That's $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. 
So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost of the pastries, we need to multiply the number of each type of pastry by its price and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts. There are 3 dozen donuts and each dozen costs $68. So, 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, we'll find the cost of the mini cupcakes. There are 2 dozen cupcakes and each dozen costs $80. So, 2 * $80 = $160.

Lastly, we'll find the cost of the mini cheesecakes. There are 6 dozen cheesecakes and each dozen costs $55. So, 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"Let's figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree.

First, we need to know how much money he gets from selling lemons each year. He gets 7 lemons per year, and each lemon is worth $1.5. So, he gets 7 x $1.5 = $10.5 per year from selling lemons.

But, it costs him $3 to take care of the tree each year. So, the money he actually makes from the tree is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

Now, the tree costs $90 to plant. We need to find out how many years it will take for the tree to make $90. To do this, we can divide the cost of the tree ($90) by the money it makes each year ($7.5).

$90 ÷ $7.5 = 12 years

So, it will take 12 years for the tree to make enough money to pay for itself. But, since it starts making money in the first year, we can say that it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's figure out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If she sold a third, that means she has two-thirds left. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with ""x"". So, she has (2/3)x vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. Now, she has (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2/3)x - 2 is (1/2)(2/3)x - 1 = (1/3)x - 1.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation: (1/3)x - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: (1/3)x = 6.

Now, we multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's figure out what percentage of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 4 students. 

Now, we need to find out how many students are left. 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Next, 25% of 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 is 4 students.

So, 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance and 4 students enrolled in jazz dance. That means 16 - 4 - 4 = 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to divide 12 by 20 and multiply by 100. 

12 / 20 = 0.6
0.6 * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's figure out which item the merchant should buy to make the most money.

The merchant is thinking about buying either jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000. The advisor says the jewelry market will go up 2.5% and the electronic gadgets market will go up 1.2% in the same month.

To find out which one will make more money, we need to calculate how much more money each item will be worth after the increase.

For the jewelry, we multiply $5,000 by 2.5% (or 0.025). This is the same as multiplying $5,000 by 25 cents (since 2.5% is the same as 2.5/10 = 0.25, and 0.25 is the same as 25 cents).

$5,000 * 25 cents = $5,000 * 0.25 = $1,250

For the electronic gadgets, we multiply $8,000 by 1.2% (or 0.012). This is the same as multiplying $8,000 by 1.2 cents (since 1.2% is the same as 1.2/100 = 0.012, and 0.012 is the same as 1.2 cents).

$8,000 * 1.2 cents = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96

Since $1,250 is more than $96, the merchant should buy the jewelry. The profit will be $1,250."
"Let's say we have two trains that leave San Rafael at the same time. They travel west for 80 miles, and then the next day, they travel north for 150 miles. We want to find out how far each train traveled in total.

To do this, we can use a special trick. When we travel in two directions, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance. It's like a puzzle.

Imagine a right triangle with the westward distance as one side (80 miles), the northward distance as the other side (150 miles), and the total distance as the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

The formula for the Pythagorean theorem is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2

In this case, a = 80 miles and b = 150 miles. We can plug these values into the formula:

80^2 + 150^2 = c^2
6400 + 22500 = c^2
28900 = c^2

Now, we need to find the square root of 28900 to get the total distance:

c = √28900
c = 170 miles

So, each train traveled a total of 170 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to figure out how much she makes from teaching and coaching, and then add those two numbers together.

First, let's find out how much she makes from teaching. She gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Since there are 50 weeks in a year, we multiply 35 hours by 50 to get the total hours she works in a year. That's 35 * 50 = 1750 hours. Now, we multiply 1750 hours by $20 to get her total earnings from teaching, which is $35,000.

Next, let's find out how much she makes from coaching. She gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. We multiply 15 hours by 50 to get the total hours she works in a year, which is 750 hours. Now, we multiply 750 hours by $30 to get her total earnings from coaching, which is $22,500.

Now, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching together to get her total annual salary. $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to know how many days are in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, we multiply the number of days by the number of eggs she eats per day. 28 days * 3 eggs per day = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs that is. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 84 eggs by 12. 84 / 12 = 7.

So, Claire eats 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and another 2 miles in 1 hour. Now she has 6 miles left to walk. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the whole hike.

To find out how long she needs to walk the whole trail, we divide the total distance by her desired average speed:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

She already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, so she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles. To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much water is in the orange drink. Since it's two-thirds water, we multiply 10 liters by 2/3. 
10 * 2/3 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Next, we need to find out how much water is in the pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, we multiply 15 liters by 3/5.
15 * 3/5 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks together. 
6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

But then, we spill 1 liter of the orange drink. So, we subtract 1 liter from the total water.
15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

We have 24 liters of the mixture left, and we want to find out how much water is in it. Since we already have 14.67 liters of water, the remaining liquid is 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

Now, we need to find out how much water is in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is 1/3 * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.

Since the pineapple drink is 2/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is 2/5 * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks together. 
14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old. We also know that Raymond is 6 years younger than Samantha. So, to find out how old Raymond is, we need to subtract 6 from Samantha's age. 

31 - 6 = 25

So, Raymond is 25 years old. 

Now, we know that Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we need to subtract 23 from Raymond's current age.

25 - 23 = 2

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's figure out how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday. 

First, we know that 3 customers bought 1 DVD each. That's 3 x 1 = 3 DVDs.

Then, 2 more customers bought 2 DVDs each. That's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

So, we add the DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers. 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"Let's figure this out. The candle melts 2 centimeters every hour. We need to know how many hours it burns. It burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. That's 4 hours.

Now, we multiply the rate at which it melts (2 cm/hour) by the number of hours it burns (4 hours). 

2 cm/hour * 4 hours = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"So, Kyle bought a book for $19.50, but that's not the original price. He got a 25% discount. To find the original price, we need to figure out what the discount is and add it back to the price he paid.

A 25% discount means he got 25% off the original price. To find 25% of a number, we multiply it by 0.25. Let's call the original price 'x'. The discount is 0.25x.

The price he paid is the original price minus the discount, so it's x - 0.25x, which is 0.75x.

We know he paid $19.50, so we can set up an equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

So, the original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"Let's figure out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered.

First, we need to find out how much money Marie spent on the chicken meal, milk, and apples. The chicken meal costs $12, the milk costs 5 packs * $3 = $15, and the apples cost 4 * $1.50 = $6. So, the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Now, we need to find out how much money Marie spent on the pizza boxes. We know she paid a total of $50, so we subtract the cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from that: $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box to find the number of boxes: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much Mishka spent, we need to add up the cost of all the things she bought.

First, let's find out how much the shorts cost. There are 3 pairs of shorts and each pair costs $16.50. So, 3 x $16.50 is $49.50.

Next, let's find out how much the pants cost. There are 3 pairs of pants and each pair costs $22.50. So, 3 x $22.50 is $67.50.

Lastly, let's find out how much the shoes cost. There are 3 pairs of shoes and each pair costs $42. So, 3 x $42 is $126.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to know how many cartons she buys and how much each carton costs.

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night for 60 days. Each carton has 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide 60 by 15.

60 ÷ 15 = 4

So, Cynthia needs 4 cartons of ice cream. Each carton costs $4. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton.

4 cartons * $4 per carton = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"Let's figure out how far Henry traveled between his first and second stops.

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. To find the distance between the two stops, we need to know where the second stop is. 

If the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, that means it's 60 - 15 = 45 miles from the start of the trip.

Now, we know that Henry's first stop was at 20 miles, and his second stop is at 45 miles. To find the distance between the two stops, we subtract the first stop from the second stop.

Distance between the first and second stops = 45 - 20
Distance between the first and second stops = 25 miles

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's figure out how much the boots cost. We know that one pair of high heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much as the first one, so it costs 2 * 33 = $66.

We also know that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. If we add the cost of the two pairs of heels, we get 33 + 66 = $99. Since the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots, the boots must cost 99 + 5 = $104.

The final answer is: $104"
"Let's say Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. We know that their ages add up to 162, so we can write an equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine the x's: 18x = 162

Now, divide both sides by 18: x = 9

So, Allen's age is 11x, which is 11 * 9 = 99. 

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to 99: 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"Let's figure out the average guess of Gunter's friends. 

The first friend thinks there are 80 jelly beans in the jar. The second friend thinks there are 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 40 + 20 is 60. 

The third friend thinks there are 25% more jelly beans than the first friend. 25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend thinks there are 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses. To do that, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of friends. The total is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. There are 3 friends.

So, the average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to know how many hours he spends per day and multiply that by 7.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day. So, we multiply 10 dogs by 0.5 hours.

10 * 0.5 = 5 hours per day

Now, we multiply 5 hours by 7 to find out how many hours he spends in a week.

5 * 7 = 35 hours

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total. We also know that she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's say the number of silver coins is S. Then, the number of gold coins is S + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can write an equation: S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine the S's: 2S + 30 = 110.

Now, subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30 to S: 40 + 30 = 70.

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. 

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. We're told that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. To find half of Raymond's jewels, we divide 40 by 2, which is 20. 

Now, we add 5 to 20 to find out how many jewels Aaron has: 20 + 5 = 25.

Finally, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. We're told that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from 25: 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's figure out how many points Mike scored in ping pong. He played for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points.

Now, let's think about the second 20 minutes. He scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25. That's 4 x 0.25 = 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's figure out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. To find out how many yogurts he eats in 30 days, we multiply 2 by 30. 

2 * 30 = 60 yogurts

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. We divide 60 by 4.

60 / 4 = 15 sets

Since each set costs $5.00, we multiply 15 by $5.00 to find out how much Terry spends.

15 * $5.00 = $75.00

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"Let's figure out how many Lego sets John has left.

First, we need to know how much money John made from selling his Lego sets. He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so we multiply 13 by 15 to find the total amount of money he made:
13 * 15 = 195 dollars

Next, we need to know how much money John spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so we multiply 8 by 20 to find the total cost of the video games:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

John also had $5 left after buying the video games. This means he spent a total of $195 - $5 = $190 on video games.

Now, we need to find out how much money John used from his own money to buy the video games. We know he spent $190 on video games, and he had $5 left, so he must have used $190 - $5 = $185 from the money he made from selling his Lego sets.

To find out how many Lego sets he sold with his own money, we divide $185 by $15 (the price of each Lego set):
185 / 15 = 12.33 (round down to 12 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

We know John sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 12 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 1 set with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 12 = 1 Lego set left."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to know how many hours he runs in a week and how many miles he runs in a week. 

John runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total hours he runs in a week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Since he runs 3 days a week, we multiply the total hours by 3 to get the total weekly hours: 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours.

Now, we know John runs 60 miles a week. To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total miles by the total hours: 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 3.33"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. We also know that her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed. So, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how fast she can walk. Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can divide 6 by 4 to find her walking speed. 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Next, we need to figure out how much time she spends walking and running. We know she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she has 6 hours, we can multiply 6 by 2/3 to find out how much time she spends walking. 6 * 2/3 = 4 hours. Then, we multiply 6 by 1/3 to find out how much time she spends running. 6 * 1/3 = 2 hours.

Now, we need to find out how far she can walk in 4 hours and how far she can run in 2 hours. We multiply her walking speed by the time she spends walking. 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles. Then, we multiply her running speed by the time she spends running. 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

Finally, we add the distance she walks and the distance she runs to find the total distance she can travel in 6 hours. 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's figure this out step by step. We know Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. We also know that Ben's iPhone is 2 times older than Suzy's iPhone. To find out how old Ben's iPhone is, we multiply 1 by 2, which is 2 years old.

Now, we know Ben's iPhone is 2 years old. We also know that Brandon's iPhone is 4 times as old as Ben's iPhone. To find out how old Brandon's iPhone is, we multiply 2 by 4, which is 8 years old.

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"So, Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet when she doesn't have the sapphire gemstone. But when she does have the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. 

To find out how far she can throw it with the gemstone, we multiply 400 by 3. 

400 * 3 = 1200 feet

This means Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet. Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's flames and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's figure out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each one into 8 pieces. So, we need to multiply 5 pies by 8 pieces per pie to find the total number of pieces.

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

Now, we know that there were 14 pieces of pie left at the end of the evening. To find out how many pieces were taken, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many calories you can still eat, we need to subtract the calories you've already eaten from your daily goal. You've eaten 1800 calories, and your goal is 2000 calories. 

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Now, we need to find out how many servings of chips you can eat with 200 calories. Each serving has 250 calories. 

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we multiply 0.8 servings by 300g to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's figure out Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles.

First, we need to know how much money Charlie gets from selling the candles. He sells each candle for $2.00, and he's selling 20 candles. 

Total money from selling candles = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total money from selling candles = 20 * $2.00
Total money from selling candles = $40.00

Now, we need to know how much it costs Charlie to make the candles. He needs 1 pound of beeswax and a wick to make 10 candles. Since he's making 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax. 

Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $10.00 per pound * 2
Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $20.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the cost from the total money Charlie made from selling the candles.

Net profit = Total money from selling candles - Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"Let's figure out how many hours Meredith spent writing articles. 

First, we need to know how many articles she wrote each day. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. 

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more articles than on Monday. To find out how many more articles she wrote, we need to multiply 5 by 2/5. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 2 more articles on Tuesday. That means she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday. So, she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the number of articles she wrote each day. 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes her 4 hours to write one article, we need to multiply the total number of articles by 4. 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"Let's figure out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice bought.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 of them at work. That means she had 80 - 220 = -140 Post-it notes left. But that can't be right because she had some Post-it notes left. So, she must have bought some more.

Let's say she bought x Post-it notes. Then, she had 80 + x Post-it notes. After using 220, she had 80 + x - 220 Post-it notes left. But we know she had 23 Post-it notes left, so we can set up an equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do that by adding 220 to both sides of the equation:

80 + x = 23 + 220
80 + x = 243

Now, we need to get rid of the 80 on the left side. We can do that by subtracting 80 from both sides:

x = 243 - 80
x = 163

So, Candice bought 163 Post-it notes.

The final answer is: 163"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

John bought blue ties that cost $40 each, and he spent $200 on them. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we need to divide the total amount he spent by the cost of each tie. 

200 ÷ 40 = 5

So, John bought 5 blue ties. Since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he must have bought 2 x 5 = 10 red ties.

Now, we need to find out how much each red tie costs. We know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. To find 50% of $40, we multiply 40 by 0.5, which is 20. Then we add that to the cost of the blue tie: 40 + 20 = 60.

So, each red tie costs $60. To find the total cost of the red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie: 10 x 60 = 600.

Now, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount John spent: 200 + 600 = 800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces of wire Tracy got, we need to know that there are 12 inches in a foot. Since the wire is 4 feet long, we multiply 4 by 12 to get the total number of inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we need to divide the total number of inches by the length of each piece, which is 6 inches.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

So, Tracy got 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. There are 15 floors and 8 units per floor, so 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply 120 by 1/4. To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (1) and then divide by the denominator (4). So, 120 * 1 = 120, and then 120 / 4 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Lloyd makes from selling eggs per week, we need to know how many eggs his chickens lay and how much he sells them for.

Lloyd's chickens lay 252 eggs per day. To find out how many eggs they lay in a week, we multiply the number of eggs per day by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold in dozens, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens are produced per week.

1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, we know that Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen. To find out how much he makes per week, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.

147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"Let's figure out how long it takes Tom to get back home.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Tom to travel from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour, we need to know the distance he traveled. We know he traveled for 3 hours, so the distance is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to travel 30 miles at 6 miles per hour. To do this, we divide the distance by the speed: 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back home.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's figure out how many toys Uriah needs to remove from his bag. First, we need to find out how much the comic books weigh in total. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and Uriah removed 30 comic books. To find the total weight of the comic books, we multiply 30 by 1/4. 

30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his bag. Since the comic books already weigh 7.5 pounds, we need to find out how much weight is left to remove. We subtract 7.5 from 15.

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy.

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his bag.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's figure out how much more money the mechanic made on the day he made the most money.

The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. On Thursday, he fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. That's a total of 6 * $60 + 4 * $40.

6 * $60 is $360 and 4 * $40 is $160. So, on Thursday, he made $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, he fixed 12 car tires, but no truck tires. That's 12 * $40, which is $480.

Now, we need to find out which day he made more money. Thursday's total is $520 and Friday's total is $480. Since $520 is more than $480, Thursday is the day he made the most money.

To find out how much more money he made on Thursday, we subtract the smaller amount from the bigger amount. So, $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"So, the Doubtfire sisters have 7 kittens that they adopted from the animal shelter. Then, their mom calls and says that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, had kittens too. 

Patchy had three times as many kittens as the ones they adopted, which is 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens, we add the adopted kittens, Patchy's kittens, and Trixie's kittens: 7 + 21 + 12 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's figure this out. Jean has 30 lollipops and she eats 2 of them. So, we need to subtract 2 from 30 to find out how many lollipops are left.

30 - 2 = 28

Now, Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag. To find out how many bags she can fill, we need to divide the number of lollipops left by 2.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with lollipops."
"Let's figure out how many times Peter can go to the movies. He has $42 and each time he goes, he spends $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn, so that's a total of $14.

42 ÷ 14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times."
"To find out how many boxes the truck can carry, we need to know how much weight the truck can hold and how much each box weighs. The bridge can only hold 5000 pounds. The driver and the empty truck weigh 3755 pounds. 

First, we need to find out how much weight is left on the truck. We do this by subtracting the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.

5000 - 3755 = 1245

This means the truck can hold 1245 pounds. Now, we need to find out how many boxes can fit in that weight. Each box weighs 15 pounds. To do this, we divide the weight the truck can hold by the weight of each box.

1245 ÷ 15 = 83

So, the truck can carry 83 boxes."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find 25% of $40.00. 25% is the same as 0.25. So, we multiply 0.25 by $40.00. 
0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

Now, we add the 25% fee to the final bill. 
$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Next, we add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the total.
$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total.
$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."

120 raspberries + 67 raspberries = 187 raspberries

The final answer is: 187"
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to know how many oranges are not good. We know there's 1 bad orange and 20% of the oranges are unripe. 

20% of 25 is 5 oranges. To find 20% of 25, we multiply 25 by 0.2 (which is the same as 20/100). 

25 * 0.2 = 5

So, there are 5 unripe oranges. Now, we add the bad and unripe oranges together. 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 
25 (total) - 6 (not good) = 19 oranges are good.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the full $50,000 pension for 10 years. After that, she gets 5% of the value of the pension for the remaining 20 years.

First, we need to find the value of the pension after 10 years. We multiply the number of years by the annual pension: 10 years * $50,000/year = $500,000.

Now, we need to find 5% of the value of the pension. To do that, we multiply $500,000 by 0.05 (which is the same as 5%). So, 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000.

Now, we add the full pension to the 5% pension: $50,000/year + $25,000/year = $75,000/year.

The final answer is: $75,000."
"To find out how much Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

The first half of the year is 6 months, and the second half of the year is also 6 months. 

The streaming service costs $140 per month. 

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount. To find 10% of $140, we multiply $140 by 0.1, which is $14. Then we subtract $14 from $140 to get $126. 

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

To find the total amount she paid, we add the two amounts together: $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To find out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to know how many miles her car can go on one gallon of gas. We can figure this out by dividing the distance she traveled since her last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons).

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can find out how far she can drive on a full tank. Her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, so we multiply the number of gallons by the miles per gallon.

12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

The final answer is: 300"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, Jim watches TV for 2 hours. Then, he reads for half that time, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour. So, in one day, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours watching TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, we multiply 3 hours by 3 to get 9 hours per week. 

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in 4 weeks. We multiply 9 hours by 4 to get 36 hours."

First, let's figure out how many players there are in total. Since each team has 5 players and there are 2 teams per school, that's 5 x 2 = 10 players per school. 

Now, we need to add the coaches. Each school has 2 coaches, one for each team. So, that's 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people per school.

Since there are 4 schools, we multiply 12 by 4 to get the total number of people. 12 x 4 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's figure out how many gems are in the treasure chest. 

We know there are 175 diamonds. We also know there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. To find the number of rubies, we need to subtract 35 from 175. 

175 - 35 = 140

So, there are 140 rubies. 

Now, we know there are twice as many emeralds as rubies. To find the number of emeralds, we need to multiply the number of rubies by 2.

140 * 2 = 280

Now, we have the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. To find the total number of gems, we need to add them together.

175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

"Let's figure out how much money Bailey started with.

Bailey gets a weekly allowance of $5. She gets this allowance for 8 weeks. To find out how much money she got in total from her allowance, we multiply the amount of her allowance by the number of weeks she got it.

$5 (weekly allowance) * 8 (weeks) = $40

Now, we know Bailey has a total of $100 after 8 weeks. To find out how much money she started with, we need to subtract the money she got from her allowance from the total amount she has.

$100 (total amount) - $40 (money from allowance) = $60

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to know how many classes she teaches and how much money she makes from each class.

Judy teaches 5 classes a day for 5 days, which is 5 x 5 = 25 classes. 
Then, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday. 
So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 x 15 = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 x $15 = $7425.

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to first find the total cost of the cell phones. 

The cell phones cost $150 each, and Shiela bought 5 of them. So, the total cost is 5 * $150 = $750.

Now, we need to add the interest. The interest is 2% of the cost of each phone, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3. 

Since there are 5 phones, the total interest is 5 * $3 = $15.

Now, we add the interest to the total cost: $750 + $15 = $765.

Since Shiela is paying in installments for 3 months, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find the monthly payment.

The monthly payment is $765 / 3 = $255.

"Let's figure out how much money Artie will make from his flower stand. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot, and begonias for $2.12 per pot.

To make it easier, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar. Marigolds are $3, petunias are $2, and begonias are $2.

Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias. Let's multiply the number of pots by the price of each flower:

Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the amounts together to find the total: $36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"So, Luke is building a sandcastle with 4 levels. The top level has a square footage of 16. Each level below it has half the square footage of the one above it. 

Let's figure out the square footage of each level. The top level is 16. The second level will be half of that, which is 16 / 2 = 8. The third level will be half of 8, which is 8 / 2 = 4. The fourth level will be half of 4, which is 4 / 2 = 2.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

To find the average square footage, we need to divide the total square footage by the number of levels. There are 4 levels, so we divide 30 by 4: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"Let's figure out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year.

First, we need to find out how much dog food the puppy eats in the first 180 days. Since it eats 1 cup of dog food every day, it will eat 180 cups in those 180 days.

Next, we need to find out how much dog food the puppy eats for the rest of the year. There are 365 days in a year, and the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, it eats 2 cups of dog food for the remaining 365 - 180 = 185 days.

To find out how many cups of dog food the puppy eats in the rest of the year, we multiply 2 cups by 185 days. That's 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

Now, we add the cups of dog food the puppy eats in the first 180 days to the cups it eats in the rest of the year. That's 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food has 110 cups, we need to divide 550 cups by 110 cups to find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year. That's 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Now, we need to find out how much laundry David and Raymond do.

We know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. To find out how much laundry David does, we need to divide 400 by 4. 400 divided by 4 is 100. So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. To find out how much laundry Raymond does, we need to divide 400 by 2. 400 divided by 2 is 200. So, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, we need to find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. To do this, we subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does. 200 - 100 is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's figure out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

First, we need to find out which package of flowers is cheaper. If Vincent buys 3 flowers for $2.50, then each flower costs $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333. If he buys 2 flowers for $1, then each flower costs $1 / 2 = $0.5.

Since $0.5 is less than $0.8333, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate how much it costs to buy 18 flowers at the better price. If Vincent buys 2 flowers for $1, then 18 flowers will cost 18 / 2 = 9 packages of 2 flowers. 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Next, let's calculate how much it costs to buy 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers. If Vincent buys 3 flowers for $2.50, then 18 flowers will cost 18 / 3 = 6 packages of 3 flowers. 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

So, the difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"So, John takes his dog to the groomer and it costs $100. But, the groomer gives him a 30% discount because he's a new customer. To find out how much it costs after the discount, we need to find 30% of $100 and subtract it from $100.

30% of $100 is like taking 30 out of 100, which is 0.3. Multiply 0.3 by $100, and that's $30. So, the discount is $30.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to divide 24 liters by 6. 

24 ÷ 6 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

The boy got 6 liters of water. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy. 
Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

Now, let's subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water. 
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's figure out how many stickers Charlie has left.

Charlie started with 10 stickers. Then he bought 21 more stickers from a store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

Next, he got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

After that, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"To find Alex's weight, we need to multiply Grace's weight by 4 and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds. Multiply 125 by 4: 125 * 4 = 500 pounds. 
Now, subtract 2 pounds from 500: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds. 

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds. 

To find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"Let's count the thorns. Dan has 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses. And each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply these numbers together.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75
Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

So, there are 600 thorns in total."
"Let's say the football team lost L games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won L + 8 games.

We know that the total number of games they played is 22, and that's the sum of the games they won and lost. So, we can write an equation: L + (L + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7

Now that we know they lost 7 games, we can find out how many they won: L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

So, the football team won 15 games."
"Let's figure out how many quilt blocks Gene has. Gene has been on vacation since he was 23 years old and now he's 34. That means he's been on vacation for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Gene goes on 4 vacations every year. To find the total number of quilt blocks, we multiply the number of years he's been vacationing by the number of vacations he goes on each year. 

11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks

The final answer is: 44"
"So, let's figure this out. The alarm rings three times a day. The first time it went off, it rang 4 times. The second time it went off, it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 times. The third time it went off, it rang half as long as the second time, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's salary after 3 more years, we need to first find her salary after 5 years. We know that her salary increases by 10% every year. 

Her initial salary is $600. To find the increase, we multiply $600 by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%). So, the increase is $600 * 0.1 = $60. 

Now, we add the increase to her initial salary: $600 + $60 = $660. We do this 5 times because she gets a 10% increase every year for 5 years. So, we add $60 to $660, 4 more times: $660 + $60 = $720, $720 + $60 = $780, $780 + $60 = $840, $840 + $60 = $900.

So, her salary after 5 years is $900. Now, we need to find her salary after 3 more years. We do the same thing: we multiply $900 by 0.1 to find the increase, which is $90. Then, we add $90 to $900: $900 + $90 = $990. We do this 2 more times: $990 + $99 = $1089, $1089 + $109.1 = $1198.1.

The final answer is: $1198.1"
"Let's say Harald sold H copies of his record. Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so she sold 10H copies.

We know that together they sold 88,000 copies. So, we can write an equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine the H's:

11H = 88,000

Now, we need to find out what H is. To do that, we divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.

The final answer is: 8000"
"So Christina is planning a birthday party and she needs 0.75 gift bags for each of her friends. She invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them won't show up. To find out how many friends will actually come, we need to subtract 1/4 of 16 from 16.

1/4 of 16 is 4, so we subtract 4 from 16. That's 16 - 4 = 12.

Now, we need to find out how many gift bags Christina needs. Since she needs 0.75 gift bags for each friend, we multiply 12 by 0.75.

12 * 0.75 = 9

So Christina needs 9 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so we multiply 9 by 2 to find the total cost.

9 * 2 = 18

The final answer is: $18"
"Let's figure out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic.

First, we need to know how much an adult and a child will eat. An adult will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult, which is 5 pounds.

There are 20 adults going to the picnic, so they will eat 20 * 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad.

There are 5 children going to the picnic, and they will eat 5 * 5 = 25 pounds of potato salad.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount eaten by adults and children together: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's figure out how many pets Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have.

We know Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Now, we need to find out how many pets Jan has. Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. To find out how many pets Jan has, we multiply the number of pets Marcia has by 3. So, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"Let's figure out how old Jackson is. We know James is 10 years old and he's 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Now, we know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson must be 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. We also know that he runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald. So, to find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time. 

Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, we know that Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much faster he is now, we need to find 10% of 40 seconds. To do that, we multiply 40 by 0.1 (since 10% is the same as 0.1). 

0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.

So, Gerald's speed improved by 4 seconds. To find out how long it takes him to run the 400-meter hurdles now, we need to subtract 4 seconds from his original time.

Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's figure out how many pets are in the neighborhood.

We know there are 60 dogs. Since there are 2 cats for every dog, we multiply 60 by 2 to find the number of cats. 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

Now, we need to find the total number of dogs and cats. We add 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

The problem says the number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of dogs and cats. So, we subtract 12 from 180. 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits. 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

The final answer is: 348"
"To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we need to know how many girls there are and how many of them are in the girl scout.

First, let's find out how many boys and girls there are. We know there are 200 students in total. If 2/5 of them are boys, then we can find the number of boys by multiplying 200 by 2/5.

200 * 2/5 = 80

So, there are 80 boys. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students.

200 - 80 = 120

Now we know there are 120 girls. We're told that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find out how many girls are in the girl scout, we multiply 120 by 2/3.

120 * 2/3 = 80

So, 80 girls are in the girl scout. To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's figure this out. Harry slept 9 hours last night. His friend James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. To find out how many hours James slept, we need to multiply 9 by 2/3.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (2) and then divide by the denominator (3). So, 9 * 2 = 18, and then 18 / 3 = 6.

Now that we know James slept 6 hours, we need to find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept. To do this, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept: 9 - 6 = 3.

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to figure out how much the tomatoes weighed before they were cooked. Since they lost half their volume when cooked, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be double the volume of the sauce. The sauce made 32 ounces, so the tomatoes must have weighed 2 * 32 = 64 ounces before cooking.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's figure out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars left that drove through the traffic jam.

We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the last 15 minutes. If we add the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes to the 20 cars that drove through in the last 15 minutes, we get the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam, which is 25.

So, if 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes, we can find out how many drove through in the first 15 minutes by subtracting 20 from 25.

25 - 20 = 5

Then, she got 18 more potted plants from the nursery. Now, she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she's going to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family. That's 40 potted plants she'll be giving away.

To find out how many potted plants she'll have left, we need to subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"Let's figure out how many times the doorbell rang. 

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. 

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell, we need to multiply 20 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 20 by 4. 20 divided by 4 is 5, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. We know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

First, we need to add up all those pages. 4 + 20 is 24, then 24 + 7 is 31, and 31 + 8 is 39. So, Solo has to read 39 pages in total.

Solo already read 15 pages on Monday. To find out how many pages are left, we need to subtract 15 from 39. 39 - 15 is 24. 

Now, we know Solo has 4 more days to read the remaining 24 pages. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we need to divide 24 by 4. 24 divided by 4 is 6.

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages per day for the next 4 days."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to figure out how many glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends, and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 x 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and one before bed) and 1 glass of soda with dinner. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. There are 2 weekend days, so he drinks 3 x 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends. 20 + 6 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to know how many miles it covers in a certain amount of time and how many miles the city is across.

The fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. We need to find out how many 3-mile sections are in 42 miles. To do this, we divide 42 by 3.

42 ÷ 3 = 14

This means there are 14 sections of 3 miles each in the city. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 * 10 = 140

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The final answer is: 140"

"To find the inner volume of the boxes, we need to find the space inside each box. 

First, we need to find the inner dimensions of each box. The box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. So, we need to subtract 1 inch from each side.

The length of the box is 5 inches, so the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

The width of the box is 6 inches, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of the box is 4 inches, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's figure out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 one-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 
On Thursday, he watched a one-hour episode and a 30-minute episode, which is 1.5 hours. 
On Friday, he watched 2 one-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.

So, in total, Frankie watched 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours of one-hour episodes. 
Since he watched TV for 7 hours in total, he must have watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours of 30-minute episodes.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched by dividing 1.5 by 0.5. 
1.5 / 0.5 = 3

"Let's figure out how many cookies Henry baked last year.

We know that Henry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, and then he dropped 5 cookies. So, if he has 110 cookies now, we need to add back the 5 cookies he dropped and then subtract 15 to find out how many cookies he meant to bake.

First, let's add back the 5 cookies he dropped: 110 + 5 = 115.

Now, we need to subtract 15 from 115 to find out how many cookies he meant to bake: 115 - 15 = 100.

But we know that Henry wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. So, if he meant to bake 100 cookies, that means he wanted to bake 2 times the number of cookies he baked last year.

Let's call the number of cookies he baked last year ""x"". Then, 2x = 100.

To find out how many cookies he baked last year, we need to divide 100 by 2: 100 ÷ 2 = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"So, let's say you're filling up your car with gas at a gas station. The gas costs $3.00 per gallon. But, if you use a special app, you get 20 cents back for every gallon you buy. You're buying 10 gallons of gas. 

First, let's find out how much the gas costs without the cashback. You multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon: 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00.

Now, let's find out how much cashback you get. You multiply the number of gallons by the cashback amount: 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00.

Now, let's subtract the cashback from the total cost of gas: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

The final answer is: $28.00"
"Let's figure out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average.

Beatrice had a roll-up that was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. To find out how many roll-ups she had, we multiply the width by the length. So, 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups.

Marcell had a roll-up that was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. To find out how many roll-ups he had, we multiply the width by the length. So, 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Now, we need to find the average number of roll-ups they ate. To do that, we add the number of roll-ups they each had and divide by 2. So, 48 + 42 = 90. Then, 90 / 2 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's figure out how much water the boat took on. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows. It took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

First, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We can do this by finding out how many feet she rows per second. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can divide 20 by 16 to get the rate: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

Now, let's multiply the rate by the total time to find the total distance rowed: 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

Since we are only interested in sets of 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10: 80 feet / 10 = 8 sets.

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2: 8 sets * 2 liters/set = 16 liters.

"So, there are 4 teachers in a classroom, and each of them teaches 2 lessons a day. That means there are 4 x 2 = 8 lessons in total per day.

Each teacher uses the whiteboard in each lesson, and the whiteboard gets cleaned 3 times per lesson. To find out how many times the whiteboard gets cleaned in a day, we multiply the number of lessons by the number of times it gets cleaned per lesson. 

8 lessons * 3 cleanings per lesson = 24 cleanings.

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's figure this out. Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. We need to know how many flowers he planted in 15 days. To do that, we multiply 2 flowers by 15 days.

2 flowers/day * 15 days = 30 flowers

But, 5 of those flowers didn't grow. So, we need to subtract 5 from 30.

30 - 5 = 25

So, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. We also know that his phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. To find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold, we need to divide 1800 by 6.

1800 ÷ 6 = 300

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs. Now, we know that the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. To find out how many ducks are in the photograph, we need to divide 300 by 50.

300 ÷ 50 = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph."
"Let's figure out how much profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber.

First, we need to find out how much she paid for the lumber. She bought 10 boards that are 2 x 4 x 10 and they cost $10 each. So, she paid 10 x $10 = $100 for those.

She also bought 5 boards that are 4 x 4 x 10 and they cost $16 each. So, she paid 5 x $16 = $80 for those.

The total amount she paid for the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's find out how much she can sell the lumber for. Prices have gone up by 50%, which means she can sell each board for 1.5 times the price she paid for it.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, she can sell each one for $10 x 1.5 = $15.
For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, she can sell each one for $16 x 1.5 = $24.

She has 10 of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, so she can sell them for 10 x $15 = $150.
She has 5 of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, so she can sell them for 5 x $24 = $120.

The total amount she can sell the lumber for is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the amount she paid for the lumber from the amount she can sell it for: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to know the ratio of sugar to water. The ratio is 7 parts sugar to 13 parts water. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

We know that the total parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20. Now, we need to find out how many groups of 20 parts are in 120 (the total amount of sugar and water used). To do this, we divide 120 by 20, which is 6.

Since the sugar is 7 out of 20 parts, we multiply 7 by 6 to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used: 7 * 6 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's figure out how much John paid for the shoes. He bought 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 kids. 

First, we need to find out how much 2 pairs of shoes cost. Since each pair costs $60, 2 pairs will cost 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we have to multiply this by the number of kids, which is 3. So, $120 * 3 = $360.

The final answer is: $360"
"Let's figure this out. There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles already at the port.

Then, more containers came in and now there are 30 vehicles in total. To find out how many more vehicles came in, we subtract the original number from the new number: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we need to divide the number of new vehicles by 5 to find out how many containers came in: 20 / 5 = 4.

So, 4 containers came in on the second day.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's figure out how much money Adrien and Lylah are making four years later.

First, we need to find out how much Lylah was making four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's salary. If Adrien was making $40000 four years ago, then Lylah was making 70% of that, which is 0.7 x $40000 = $28000.

Now, let's find out how much Adrien's salary increased. He was making $40000 four years ago, and he's making more now. His salary increased by 40%. To find 40% of $40000, we multiply 0.4 by $40000, which is $16000. So, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. To find 40% of $28000, we multiply 0.4 by $28000, which is $11200. So, Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

Now, let's add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find their total salary: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

The final answer is: $95200"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we need to know how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Each pad has 30 sheets of paper. So, he uses 2 x 30 = 60 sheets of paper a week.

There are 4 weeks in a month. To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4: 60 x 4 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's figure out how many fruits Morisette and Kael have in total.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. Kael also brought half as many oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

To find the total number of fruits Morisette brought, we add the number of apples and oranges: 5 + 8 = 13.

To find the total number of fruits Kael brought, we add the number of apples and oranges: 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, we add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought: 13 + 14 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in a week, we need to add up the hours she slept each day.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 7 hours each day.

Let's count the hours for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours: 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts. 

First, Rosie runs 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find out how many miles she runs in 3 hours, we multiply 10 miles per hour by 3 hours. That's 10 x 3 = 30 miles.

Now, we need to find out how many hours are left. We know Rosie runs for 7 hours in total, and she already ran for 3 hours. So, we subtract 3 from 7 to get the remaining hours. 7 - 3 = 4 hours.

Next, Rosie runs 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours. To find out how many miles she runs in 4 hours, we multiply 5 miles per hour by 4 hours. That's 5 x 4 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles Rosie ran in the first part (30 miles) to the miles she ran in the second part (20 miles). 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

Jennie has 60 letters that need stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of them. To find one-third of 60, we can divide 60 by 3. 

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, Jennie stamps 20 letters. Now, we need to find out how many letters are left that need stamps. We subtract 20 from 60.

60 - 20 = 40

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that before Jennie started, there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters in the already-stamped pile.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's figure out how many spoons Julia bought.

We know that Julia's husband gave her 5 spoons, and she had some spoons already. After using 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's say the number of spoons Julia bought is 'x'. Then, the number of spoons she had after using 3 is 'x - 3'. 

Since her husband gave her 5 spoons, we can add those to the number of spoons she had after using 3. So, the total number of spoons she had is 'x - 3 + 5'. We know this is equal to 12.

We can write an equation: x - 3 + 5 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation. This gives us: x = 10

So, Julia bought 10 spoons.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"Let's figure this out. We know Lily made 50 friends. Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. To find out how many friends Amy made, we need to add 20 to 50. 

50 + 20 = 70

So, Amy made 70 friends. Now, we need to find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together. We can do this by adding the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has.

50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's figure out how much money Dillon will spend at the store. 

First, we need to know the cost of each item. We know that a pepper costs $15. 

Since a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, we multiply 3 by $15 to find the cost of a watermelon. 3 x $15 = $45.

Now, we know that an orange costs $5 less than a watermelon. So, we subtract $5 from $45 to find the cost of an orange. $45 - $5 = $40.

Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so we multiply 4 by $45 to find the total cost of the watermelons. 4 x $45 = $180.

Dillon also buys 20 peppers, so we multiply 20 by $15 to find the total cost of the peppers. 20 x $15 = $300.

Lastly, Dillon buys 10 oranges, so we multiply 10 by $40 to find the total cost of the oranges. 10 x $40 = $400.

Now, we add up the total cost of the watermelons, peppers, and oranges to find out how much money Dillon will spend. $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find out how much profit the hospital makes, we need to know how much time the doctors spend with patients and how much they charge for that time.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each person is seen for 24 minutes. To find the total time spent, we multiply the number of people by the time per person.

500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so we multiply the total hours by their hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Now, we need to find out how much money the hospital makes from the patients. The hospital charges $200 an hour, and each person is seen for 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.

500 people * 0.4 hours/person = 200 hours

The hospital charges $200 an hour, so we multiply the total hours by their hourly rate.

200 hours * $200/hour = $40000

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $40000 - $30000
Profit = $10000

The final answer is: $10000"
"So, Nissa hires 60 elves to work in her department store's Santa village. Then, a third of them quit because kids were being gross. To find out how many quit, we need to divide 60 by 3. 60 divided by 3 is 20. So, 20 elves quit.

Now, we need to find out how many elves are left. We had 60 elves and 20 quit, so we subtract 20 from 60. 60 - 20 is 40. So, there are 40 elves left.

But wait, it doesn't end there. 10 more elves quit because kids kicked their shins. We need to subtract 10 from 40 to find out how many are left. 40 - 10 is 30.

"Let's figure out how many tickets Pam and Fred used at the carnival.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times. That's a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides for Pam.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times. That's a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides for Fred.

Now, let's add up the total number of rides. 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets. To find the total number of tickets used, we multiply the total number of rides by the cost per ride. 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

"Let's figure out how many video games Bobby has. First, we need to know how many video games Brian has. But, Brian lost 5 video games right before we compared the number of games. So, we need to subtract 5 from the number of video games Brian had.

Brian had 20 video games, and he lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Now, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. We know that Bobby has 5 fewer video games than 3 times the number of video games Brian has. To find 3 times the number of video games Brian has, we multiply 15 by 3.

15 * 3 = 45

Now, we need to subtract 5 from 45 to find out how many video games Bobby has.

45 - 5 = 40

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to do a few steps.

First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are there, we can divide 27 by 3. 

27 ÷ 3 = 9

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we need to find out how many of those unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3.

9 * 2 = 18
18 ÷ 3 = 6

So, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how much Rory's delivery order will cost, we need to add up the cost of the food and then add the delivery fee and the tip.

First, let's add up the cost of the food:

- 2 subs cost $7.50 each, so 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips cost $1.50 each, so 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies cost $1.00 each, so 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- The total cost of the food is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the delivery fee. The delivery fee is 20% of the total cost of the food. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20. This is the same as multiplying $20.00 by 20% or 20/100. So, 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00. Now we add the delivery fee to the total cost of the food: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we need to add the tip. The tip is $5.00. So, we add $5.00 to the total cost with the delivery fee: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"Let's figure out how many questions Mark left incomplete.

Mark took a test with 75 questions and another test with 100 questions. He did both tests at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours. Since he does 5 questions per hour, he can do 8 x 5 = 40 questions in 8 hours.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours. Since he does 5 questions per hour, he can do 6 x 5 = 30 questions in 6 hours.

So, Mark completed 40 + 30 = 70 questions in total.

There were 75 + 100 = 175 questions in both tests.

To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we subtract the questions he completed from the total questions: 175 - 70 = 105.

The final answer is: 105"

To do that, we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4. That's because the problem says there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs.

4 x 12 = 48. So, there are 48 gumballs that are either blue or pink.

Now, we need to add 22 to 48 to find out how many pink gumballs there are. That's because the problem says there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs.

48 + 22 = 70.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to know how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. 

To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars. 

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's solve the problem. We know there are 700 bees in total. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's say the number of queens is Q. Then the number of baby bees is 2Q, and the number of worker bees is 2(2Q), which is 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write an equation: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700.

To find Q, we divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find the number of baby bees: 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

And we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

So, there are 400 worker bees.

"Let's figure out how much everything cost. 

First, we need to find the cost of the food items. John bought milk for 2 dollars and eggs for 3 dollars. So, the total cost of the food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

Next, we need to find the cost of the non-food items. John bought light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. So, the total cost of the non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Now, we need to add a 10% tax to the non-food items. To do this, we multiply 10 dollars by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%). This gives us 10 * 0.1 = 1 dollar. So, the total cost of the non-food items with tax is 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items with tax to get the total cost. This is 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

"Let's figure out how much profit Kim will make from his housekeeping business. He has 3 clients now and he's talking to 5 more, so he thinks he'll have 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths to clean their house.

To find out how many bottles of bleach he'll need, we multiply the number of clients by 2. 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles. And to find out how many packs of cloths he'll need, we multiply the number of clients by 1. 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs.

Now, let's find out how much bleach and cloths will cost him. Each bottle of bleach costs $2, so 16 bottles will cost 16 * $2 = $32. Each pack of cloths costs $5, so 8 packs will cost 8 * $5 = $40.

The total cost for bleach and cloths is $32 + $40 = $72. This is his total expenses. To find out his profit, we need to subtract his expenses from his income. His income is $92, so his profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Now, we need to find out how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year. Since he harvests every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests:
1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, half of those bees come back. Half of 30 is 15, so 15 bees return.

Now, let's think about the bees that haven't come back yet. We know 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, and 15 came back. That means 30 - 15 = 15 bees haven't come back yet.

Next, in the next 6 hours, twice as many bees leave the hive as left in the first 6 hours. Twice as many as 30 is 60, so 60 bees leave the hive.

Now, let's think about all the bees that left the hive. We know 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, and 60 bees left in the next 6 hours. That's a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees. But we know that 15 bees haven't come back yet, so that means 90 - 15 = 75 bees haven't come back yet.

Finally, in the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that and hadn't come back yet come back. That's 15 bees.

"Let's figure out who will win the race between Steve and Tim. Steve lives 3 miles away from school, and he can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from school, and he can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute.

First, we need to convert the miles to feet because their speeds are in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile. So, Steve's distance is 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet, and Tim's distance is 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, let's calculate how long it takes for each of them to get home. Time is equal to distance divided by speed.

Time taken by Steve = 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes

Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 36
Difference in time = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"So, Shawnda is running a bike inflation service in her neighborhood. She charges 25 cents to inflate each tire. On the first day, 5 people came by with their bicycles, and each bike has 2 tires. That's 5 x 2 = 10 tires. 

The cost to inflate those tires is 10 x 25 cents = $2.50. 

Then, 3 people came by with their tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires. That's 3 x 3 = 9 tires. 

The cost to inflate those tires is 9 x 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, 1 person came by with a unicycle, and a unicycle has 1 tire. So, that's 1 x 25 cents = $0.25.

To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to add up the cost of all the tires. $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"Let's figure out how much change Carl gets when he buys cookies.

Carl buys 10 packs of cookies. Each pack has 6 cookies inside. Each cookie costs $0.10.

First, we need to find out how many cookies Carl buys in total. We multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

Now, we need to find out how much all those cookies cost. We multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he gets, we subtract the cost of the cookies from the $10 bill: $10 - $6 = $4.

So, Carl gets $4 in change."
"Let's figure out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

First, Dave ate 14 french fries. Then a seagull came and ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 french fries. So, the seagull ate 7 fries, and now the total number of fries eaten is 14 (by Dave) + 7 (by seagull) = 21 fries.

Next, three pigeons came and ate 3 fries each, which is 9 fries in total. Now, the total number of fries eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 fries.

After that, a raccoon came and ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the total number of fries initially x. The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30). The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).

After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5. We can simplify this to (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.

Now, let's solve for x. We can multiply both sides by 3 to get x - 30 = 18. Then, we add 30 to both sides to get x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's figure out how many hours Kimo spends in class. 

Kimo goes to class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. So, that's 3 hours a day for 3 days. 3 x 3 is 9 hours.

Kimo also goes to class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. So, that's 4 hours a day for 2 days. 4 x 2 is 8 hours.

Now, we add the hours from the 3 days and the 2 days. 9 + 8 is 17 hours. That's how many hours Kimo spends in class in one week.

There are 16 weeks in a semester. To find out how many hours Kimo spends in class in a semester, we multiply the hours in a week by the number of weeks. 17 x 16 is 272.

The final answer is: 272"
"Let's figure out how long all the baked goods are when lined up end to end.

First, we need to know how long each type of baked good is. We know that each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the baguette to inches: 2 feet * 12 inches/foot = 24 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

The final answer is: 280"
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to know how many bananas each type of ape eats in 2 months. 

Monkeys eat 200 bananas per month, so in 2 months, they eat 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
Gorillas eat 400 bananas per month, so in 2 months, they eat 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons eat 100 bananas per month, so in 2 months, they eat 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"Let's figure out who ran the farthest between Blake and Kelly.

Blake ran back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he ran back and forth, he covered 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly ran back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she ran to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She did this 34 times, so the total distance she covered is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how much Raphael spent, we need to add up the cost of the things he bought.

First, let's find the cost of the pens. There are 4 pens and each one costs $1.5. So, 4 x $1.5 = $6.

Next, we need to find the cost of the notebooks. There are 2 notebooks and each one costs $4. So, 2 x $4 = $8.

Then, we need to add the cost of the bond paper, which is $20.

Now, we add all the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"Let's figure this out. Finn starts with 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more come out of hiding, so now he sees 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. But then, 2 of them hide under a rock, so we need to subtract those. 17 - 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to first find the depth of the water on Tuesday. 

The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Now, we need to find two thirds of 24. To do this, we can multiply 24 by 2 and then divide by 3.

24 * 2 = 48
48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.

To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. So, 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by Locsin. 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. 19 (Anakin's fish) + 13 (Locsin's fish) = 32 fish.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much a bag of marbles costs after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

The original price of a bag of marbles is $20. Every two months, the price increases by 20% of the original price.

After 2 months, the price will be $20 + ($20 * 0.20) = $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price will be $24 + ($24 * 0.20) = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After 6 months, the price will be $28.80 + ($28.80 * 0.20) = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

We can see a pattern here. Every two months, the price increases by $4.80, $5.76, $6.912, and so on. The increase is getting bigger each time.

Let's try to find a pattern in the increases:

- After 2 months, the increase is $4.
- After 4 months, the increase is $4.80.
- After 6 months, the increase is $5.76.
- After 8 months, the increase is $6.912.

The increases are getting bigger by $0.80, $0.96, $1.128, and so on. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $0.96, $1.128, $1.296, and so on.

To find the total increase after 36 months, we need to find the sum of the increases for 18 periods (since 36 months is 18 periods of 2 months each).

The total increase is the sum of an arithmetic series with 18 terms, a first term of $4, and a common difference of $0.96, $1.128, $1.296, and so on.

To find the sum of this series, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = (n/2) * (a1 + an)

where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

First, we need to find the last term (an). We can do this by finding the 18th term of the sequence:

an = a1 + (n-1) * d
= 4 + (18-1) * 1.296
= 4 + 17 * 1.296
= 4 + 22.032
= 26.032

Now we can find the sum:

Sum = (n/2) * (a1 + an)
= (18/2) * (4 + 26.032)
= 9 * 30.032
= 270.288

The total increase is $270.288. To find the final price, we add this to the original price:

Final price = Original price + Total increase
= $20 + $270.288
= $290.288

The final answer is: $290.29"
"Let's figure out how much all the toys are worth.

We have 5 red cars, and each one costs $4. So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.

We also have 3 action figures, and each one costs $5. So, the total cost of the action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which is $15.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the toys: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"Let's figure this out. Jackie wants to know if she should do her taxes herself or hire an accountant. If she does it herself, she'll have to stop working on her freelance job for 3 hours. She makes $35 per hour, so she'll lose $35 * 3 = $105.

The accountant costs $90. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of the accountant from the money she'll lose if she does it herself. So, $105 - $90 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira has left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of the computer accessories from her budget.

First, let's add up the cost of all the accessories:

- The computer costs €1090.
- The scanner costs €157.
- The CD burner costs €74.
- The printer costs €102.

Let's add these numbers together: €1090 + €157 = €1247, then €1247 + €74 = €1321, and finally €1321 + €102 = €1423.

Now, we need to subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget of €1500.

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to know how many eggs she needs in total. She's making 15 Spanish flans and each one needs 3 eggs. So, we multiply 15 by 3 to get the total number of eggs she needs: 15 * 3 = 45 eggs.

Now, we need to know how many eggs she gets per babysitting job. Her neighbor gives her 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times she has to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs she needs by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job: 45 / 9 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we call Brooke's age ""B"", then Seth's age is 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke will be B + 2 years old, and Seth will be 2B + 2 years old. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So, we can write an equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine the B's and the 2's:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke is 8 years old, we can find Seth's age. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is 2 x 8 = 16 years old.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's figure out how much money Jimmy has. We know that Ethel has $8. To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to find out what's twice that amount. Twice of 8 is 2 x 8 = 16.

Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to figure out how many miles he walks each day and then add them all up.

Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday. That's 5 days. So, we multiply 20 miles by 5 days: 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

Then, we need to add the miles he walks on the weekends. He walks 10 miles on Saturday and Sunday. That's 2 days. So, we multiply 10 miles by 2 days: 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to figure out how much the hat, jacket, and pants cost.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so it's 3 x $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"Let's count the legs of all the creatures Jake sees at the Museum of Entomology.

First, we have 80 spiders. Each spider has 8 legs. So, we multiply 80 spiders by 8 legs to get the total number of spider legs: 80 * 8 = 640 legs.

Next, we have 90 insects. Each insect has 6 legs. We multiply 90 insects by 6 legs to get the total number of insect legs: 90 * 6 = 540 legs.

Then, there are 3 rare mutant invertebrates. Each of these has 10 legs. We multiply 3 invertebrates by 10 legs to get the total number of invertebrate legs: 3 * 10 = 30 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs: 640 (spider legs) + 540 (insect legs) + 30 (invertebrate legs) = 1210 legs.

The final answer is: 1210"
"Let's figure out the ages of the four birds.

We know that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. We also know that Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Now, let's think about Granny Red. We know she's two times as old as Sally Four. To find her age, we multiply Sally Four's age by 2. 2 * 8 = 16. So, Granny Red is 16 years old.

Next, we need to find out how old Sally Two is. We know she's three years older than Granny Red. To find her age, we add 3 to Granny Red's age. 16 + 3 = 19. So, Sally Two is 19 years old.

Now, we have all the ages: Sally Four is 8, Sally Two is 19, Granny Red is 16, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8. To find the total age of the four birds, we add their ages together: 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.

"Let's figure out how much Jessica pays in a year. She has three debts: student loans, a credit card, and a mortgage. Each one has a minimum payment. But Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.

The minimum payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

To pay 50% more, we multiply each minimum payment by 1.5:
- Student loans: $300 * 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since Jessica pays this amount each month, we multiply it by 12 to get the total annual payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find out how long it takes Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to know how long it takes him to do each task. It takes him 1.5 minutes to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut one. 

First, let's convert the time it takes to cut a potato into minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 5 seconds is equal to 5/60 minutes.

Now, let's multiply the time it takes to peel one potato by the total number of potatoes. There are 60 potatoes, so it will take 60 * 1.5 minutes to peel all of them. That's 90 minutes.

Next, let's multiply the time it takes to cut one potato by the total number of potatoes. It takes 5/60 minutes to cut one potato, so it will take 60 * (5/60) minutes to cut all of them. That's 5 minutes.

Now, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cut all the potatoes. 90 minutes + 5 minutes is 95 minutes.

The final answer is: 95"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money they made from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so they make $10 per gallon.

They made a profit of $25, which means they made $25 more than they spent. Let's call the total amount they spent ""x"". Then, the total amount they made is x + $25.

Since they sell each gallon for $10, the number of gallons they sold is (x + $25) / $10.

The cost of making lemonade is $5 per gallon ($3 for lemons and $2 for sugar). The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.

The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons. So, the total cost of lemons is $3 * ((x + $25) / $10).

We know that the total amount they made minus the total cost is equal to the profit. So, we can set up the equation:

$10 * ((x + $25) / $10) - $3 * ((x + $25) / $10) = $25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(10 - 3) * ((x + $25) / $10) = $25
7 * ((x + $25) / $10) = $25
(x + $25) / $10 = $25 / 7
x + $25 = $25 * (10 / 7)
x + $25 = $35.71
x = $10.71

Now that we have the total cost, we can find the cost of lemons:

Total cost = $10.71
Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
Total cost of lemons = $10.71
Number of gallons = $10.71 / $3
Number of gallons = 3.57

Since we can't have a fraction of a gallon, we'll round down to 3 gallons. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, so the total cost of lemons is:

$3 * 3 = $9

The final answer is: $9"
"Let's figure this out. We know there are 240 people in the race. Out of those, 80 are Japanese. To find out how many Chinese people are in the race, we need to subtract the number of Japanese people from the total number of people.

240 (total people) - 80 (Japanese people) = 160

So, there are 160 Chinese people in the race. Now, we know that 60 of those Chinese people are boys. To find out how many girls there are, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people.

160 (Chinese people) - 60 (boys) = 100

So, there are 100 girls on the Chinese team.

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's figure out how much money Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations.

First, Zaid earns 6000 dollars a month. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 600 dollars. Then, he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 2000 dollars. 

Now, let's add up the money he spent so far: 600 + 2000 = 2600 dollars.

To find out how much money is left, we need to subtract the money he spent from his total salary: 6000 - 2600 = 3400 dollars.

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining money to his favorite charity, which is 1700 dollars. Now, let's subtract that from the remaining money: 3400 - 1700 = 1700 dollars.

Zaid also gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars. So, let's add those amounts together: 200 + 700 = 900 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the money he gave to his family from the remaining money: 1700 - 900 = 800 dollars.

The final answer is: $800"
"Let's figure out how many crabs Rani, Monic, and Bo have together.

We know Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Now, we need to find out how many crabs Rani has. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs, we add the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The final answer is: 122"

"So, there are two candidates running for class representative at Sarai's school. The winner got 3/4 of the votes, and there are 80 students in the class. To find out how many votes the winner got, we need to multiply 3/4 by 80.

3/4 * 80 = 60

So, the winner got 60 votes. Now, to find out how many votes the loser got, we need to subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"Let's figure out how many red roses Fred needs to deliver to Sandra. We know that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, and that's five times the number of white carnations. To find out how many white carnations she ordered, we need to divide 200 by 5.

200 ÷ 5 = 40

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Now, we know that she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. To find out how many red roses she ordered, we need to multiply 40 by 4.

40 × 4 = 160

So, Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses to Sandra by 5 pm."
"Let's figure out how old Jean is.

We know that Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was 28. 

Now, let's think about Mark. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age two years ago. Half of 28 is 14, and 14 + 5 is 19. So, two years ago, Mark was 19 years old.

To find out how old Mark is now, we need to add 2 to 19. 19 + 2 is 21. So, Mark is 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we need to add 2 to 21. 21 + 2 is 23. So, Jean is 23 years old.

"Let's figure out how much time the faster team will win by.

The well-rounded team has four members, and each of them runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. To find their total time, we need to multiply 55 seconds by 4. 

55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

Now, let's look at the less well-rounded team. Their first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we need to add up the times for the less well-rounded team: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

To find out how much time the faster team will win by, we need to subtract the less well-rounded team's time from the well-rounded team's time: 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"Let's say Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. We want to know how much more likely it is that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

First, let's think about rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers that are greater than 3: 4, 5, and 6. Since there are 6 numbers on a six-sided die, the chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3 out of 6, or 50%.

Now, let's think about rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The chance of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3 out of 6, or 50%. The chance of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 50%. Since these are two separate rolls, we multiply the chances together: 50% * 50% = 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference in chance between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. 

50% - 25% = 25%

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Let's figure this out. If Jenna's mom picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many as her mom, we need to find half of 20. Half of 20 is 10. So, Jenna picked 10 apples.

Now, we need to find the total number of apples they both picked. We can do this by adding the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked. 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's figure out how many rats are in each cage. 

First, we need to find out how many straw pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. So, the hamsters get 10 x 5 = 50 pieces of straw.

The rabbits get 20 pieces of straw.

Now, we add the straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits. 50 + 20 = 70.

We know that 160 pieces of straw are given to the small rodents, and 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits. So, the rats get 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw.

The rats are kept in 3 cages, and each cage has the same number of rats. Let's call the number of rats in each cage 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's figure out how much Mandy should pay back to Benedict.

Mandy owes Benedict $100 and they agreed to have a 2% interest each month. This means that every month, Mandy will have to pay 2% of $100, which is $2.

So, after the first month, Mandy will owe $100 + $2 = $102.
After the second month, Mandy will owe $102 + $2.04 (2% of $102) = $104.04.
After the third month, Mandy will owe $104.04 + $2.0808 (2% of $104.04) = $106.1208.

So, Mandy should pay back $106.12 to Benedict.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

The trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at $20 per bag. He then sells them at $30 per bag and makes a profit of $400. We need to find out how many bags he sold.

First, let's think about the cost. It costs $20 to buy each bag and $2 to transport each bag. So, the total cost to buy and transport each bag is $20 + $2 = $22.

Now, let's think about the money the trader made. He sold each bag for $30, so the total money he made is $30 times the number of bags he sold.

The profit is the money he made minus the cost. We know the profit is $400. So, we can set up an equation:

Money made - cost = profit
$30x - $22x = $400

Where x is the number of bags he sold.

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much they spent on food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

Next, we need to find out how much they spent on rides. They went on 2 rides that cost $33 each, so they spent 2 * $33 = $66 on rides.

Now, we need to find the total cost. We add the cost of the tickets, food, and rides: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3. $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is $34."
"Let's figure out how many peaches John collects. We know he collects peaches for 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he collects peaches for 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to know how many peaches he collects per minute. We're told he collects 2 peaches a minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the number of peaches per minute by the total minutes: 2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to know how much they need per week and then divide that by 7.

Ducks need 3.5 pounds of insects each per week. If there are 10 ducks, we multiply 3.5 pounds by 10 ducks to get the total pounds of insects they need per week.

3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Now, we divide 35 pounds by 7 to get the pounds of insects they need per day.

35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds

So, the ducks need 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's figure out how many trees Tom has left.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and cuts down 2 trees a year. So, he adds 10 trees and subtracts 2 trees every year. That's a total of 8 more trees each year.

If he does this for 10 years, he will have 8 more trees each year for 10 years. To find the total number of extra trees, we multiply 8 by 10, which is 80.

Tom starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, he will have 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

But then, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 130, we multiply 130 by 0.3. That's 130 * 0.3 = 39.

So, 39 trees die. To find out how many trees Tom has left, we subtract 39 from 130. That's 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"So, let's figure out how many more pink plastic flamingos are out than white plastic flamingos.

First, the neighbors put 18 pink flamingos in Sue's front yard. Then, they took back one third of them, which is 18 / 3 = 6. They painted those 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

Next, they added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. Now, we have 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The number of white flamingos is still 6. To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Violetta wants to buy new crayons. She needs 5 different colors and has $20 to spend. Each crayon costs $2. 

To find out how many crayons she can buy, we need to divide the money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Now, to find out how much change she will get, we need to subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has. 

Total cost of crayons = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 * $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to know that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we add the cost of a pencil and an eraser to find the cost of a pen.

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. To do this, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"Let's figure out how many pounds of carrots won't be used. We have 200 pounds of carrots and we want to give 2 pounds to each of the 40 restaurants.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of carrots we'll give to all the restaurants. We can do this by multiplying the number of pounds each restaurant gets (2) by the number of restaurants (40).

2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of carrots won't be used. To do this, we subtract the pounds we gave out (80) from the total pounds we had (200).

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

So, 120 pounds of carrots won't be used.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of kids in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population. 

First, we add the number of men and women together: 8417 + 9092 = 17509. 

Now, we subtract that number from the total population: 23786 - 17509 = 6277.

So, there are 6277 kids in Soda."
"Let's figure out how many Pokémon cards Elaine has now.

Elaine started with 20 Pokémon cards. Then, she collected three times that number in the first month. Three times 20 is 60, so she collected 60 cards in the first month.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month. That means she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards in the second month.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. To find the combined number, we add 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that is 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards: 20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

Mark edits sentences for two different publishers. He edits the same number of sentences for each publisher. Let's say he edits x sentences for each publisher. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences, we can write an equation: x + x = 1000. This simplifies to 2x = 1000. To find x, we divide both sides by 2, which gives us x = 500. So Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A, he makes 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher B, so he makes 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the money he makes from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"Baldur gets water from a well. He gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. We need to find out how many liters of water he gets every day.

First, let's find out how many pails of water he gets in a day. He gets 5 pails in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. So, he gets a total of 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Now, we need to find out how many liters of water are in each pail. We are told that each pail contains 5 liters of water.

To find the total amount of water he gets every day, we multiply the total number of pails by the amount of water in each pail. So, 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"So John gets a $5000 award and a 5% raise at work. He makes $2000 a week. Let's figure out how much he makes in a year.

First, we need to find out how much more he makes per week after the raise. To do that, we need to find 5% of $2000. 

5% is the same as 5/100, so we multiply 2000 by 5 and then divide by 100. 

2000 * 5 = 10000
10000 / 100 = 100

So he makes $100 more per week. Now we add that to his original $2000 a week.

2000 + 100 = 2100

Now we know he makes $2100 a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply 2100 by 52.

2100 * 52 = 109200

So John makes $109200 in a year."
"Let's figure out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year.

First, we need to know how many tons of grapes her farm produces. Since she has 10 acres and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes, we multiply 10 acres by 5 tons/acre.

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Now, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, we multiply the total tons of grapes by 2 barrels/ton.

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Let's figure out how many slices of cheese Carl used.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch for a whole week. He used 2 slices of cheese for each sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese for his sandwiches.

He also ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days of the week. He used one more slice of cheese for each omelet than he did for a sandwich, so he used 3 slices of cheese for each omelet. That's 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for his omelets.

Lastly, he made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that used 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up all the slices of cheese he used: 14 (for sandwiches) + 9 (for omelets) + 8 (for macaroni and cheese) = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's figure out how many pens Janet has now. 

Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. That's a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Then, she bought some more pens. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag had 9 pens. So, she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, and each bag had 6 pens. So, she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add up all the new pens she bought: 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 66 pens.

To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to add the new pens to the pens she already had: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to know what her average score should be and how many tests she has. Mr. Bert wants her average to be 93, and she has 6 tests. 

First, we multiply the average by the number of tests to find the total score she needs. 

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Now, we need to find the total score of the first 5 tests. We add up the scores of the first 5 tests.

89 + 71 = 160
160 + 92 = 252
252 + 100 = 352
352 + 86 = 438

So, the total score of the first 5 tests is 438. Since Mr. Bert lets her drop the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score of the first 5 tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining 4 tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first 5 tests.

438 - 71 = 367

Now, we need to find the score she needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score of the remaining 4 tests from the total score needed.

558 - 367 = 191

So, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test.

The final answer is: $\boxed{191}$"
"Let's figure out how many kilometers Michael rode his bike in total.

First, we need to find out how many kilometers he rode in the first four weeks. He rode 25 kilometers each time and did that 5 times a week for 4 weeks. So, we multiply 25 by 5 by 4.

25 * 5 = 125
125 * 4 = 500

So, in the first four weeks, Michael rode 500 kilometers.

Next, we need to find out how many kilometers he rode in the next three weeks. He rode 60 kilometers each time and did that 2 times a week for 3 weeks. So, we multiply 60 by 2 by 3.

60 * 2 = 120
120 * 3 = 360

So, in the next three weeks, Michael rode 360 kilometers.

Now, we need to add the total kilometers for both periods to find the total number of kilometers Michael rode.

500 + 360 = 860

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to find the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples, then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, and each one weighs 40g. So, the weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Now, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: 2600"
"Let's figure out how many cakes Rose bought. 

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes. 

On Tuesday, she went to a different store and bought three times that number of cakes. Three times 4 is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday. Five times 12 is 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much half a dozen plates cost. Since each plate costs $6000, we multiply 6 (half a dozen) by $6000. That's 6 x $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than $36,000. So, we subtract $1200 from $36,000. That's $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Next, we need to find out how many cups we're talking about. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 x 12 = 240 cups.

Now, to find out how much each cup costs, we divide the total cost of the cups ($34,800) by the number of cups (240). That's $34,800 ÷ 240 = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"Sara wants to buy a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's find out how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's see how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Jerry has red chickens and white chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.

We also know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. Let's call the number of red chickens ""R"" and the number of white chickens ""W"". Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can say that W = R + 2.

We can make an equation to represent the total number of eggs Jerry collects. Since the red chickens lay 3 eggs each and the white chickens lay 5 eggs each, we can multiply the number of chickens by the number of eggs they lay and add them together. This gives us the equation: 3R + 5W = 42.

Now, we can substitute W = R + 2 into the equation. This gives us: 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42.

Next, we can expand the equation by multiplying the numbers inside the parentheses. This gives us: 3R + 5R + 10 = 42.

Now, we can combine the like terms, which are the Rs. This gives us: 8R + 10 = 42.

To get rid of the 10 on the left side of the equation, we can subtract 10 from both sides. This gives us: 8R = 32.

Finally, we can solve for R by dividing both sides of the equation by 8. This gives us: R = 4.

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to know the total distance he walks. Since the park is a rectangle, we need to find its perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is the distance around the outside. To find it, we add up the lengths of all four sides.

The park is 6 miles long and 1.5 miles wide. So, we add 6 + 6 (the other long side) + 1.5 + 1.5 (the other short side). That's 6 + 6 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 15 miles.

Now that we know the total distance is 15 miles, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk that distance. We know he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time, we divide the total distance by his speed: 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. 

The next day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. So, we add 50 to 100 to find out how many customers she counted on the second day. 100 + 50 = 150.

Now, we know that by the third day, the total number of customers was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the total customers on the first two days from the total by the third day. 

So, we add the customers from the first two days: 100 + 150 = 250. 

Now, we subtract 250 from 500: 500 - 250 = 250.

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have two pools, and both of them are leaking water at the same rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, it had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at the same rate, they both lost the same amount of water in the last 4 minutes. So, the small pool now has x - 4 gallons of water, and the big pool now has 2x - 4 gallons of water.

We know that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can write an equation to represent this:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

To solve for x, we need to simplify the equation. First, let's distribute the 4 on the right side:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Now, let's add 4 to both sides of the equation:

2x = 4x - 12

Next, let's subtract 4x from both sides:

-2x = -12

Now, let's divide both sides by -2:

x = 6

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since 4 gallons leaked out, the small pool now has 6 - 4 = 2 gallons of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to know how much money she needs to make and how much she makes per hour. 

The shoes cost $320 and the belt costs $32, so we need to add those two numbers together to find the total cost.

$320 + $32 = $352

Now, we need to divide the total cost by how much Lori makes per hour, which is $8.

$352 ÷ $8 = 44

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make enough money to buy the shoes and the belt."
"Let's figure out how much Janeth will have left after paying $165 a month for 12 months.

First, we need to find out how much Janeth will pay in total. We can do this by multiplying the amount she pays each month by the number of months.

$165/month * 12 months = $1980

Now, let's think about what Janeth promised to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back $2000 plus an extra 10% of that amount. To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.10.

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Janeth promised to pay back $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she paid ($1980) from the total amount she promised to pay ($2200) to find out how much she still owes.

$2200 - $1980 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"Let's count the flowers in the vase. There are 4 roses in the vase. We know there are 7 more dahlias than roses. To find out how many dahlias there are, we add 7 to 4. 

4 + 7 = 11

So, there are 11 dahlias. Now, we need to find the total number of flowers. We add the number of roses and dahlias together: 
4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

"Let's figure out the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years.

We know that Harriet is 21 years old now. We also know that Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack must be 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, let's think about their ages in three years. 
- Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
- Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.
- Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's figure out how many points Jojo scored in the board game. 

We know that Naomi scored 68 points. Now, let's find out how many points Yuri scored. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of 68 is 34, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Next, we need to find out how many points Brianna scored. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since all four students scored a total of 251 points, we need to find out how many points Jojo scored. To do that, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points. 251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to add up the time she spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles.

She spent 10 minutes on each crossword puzzle and she did 3 of them, so that's 3 x 10 = 30 minutes.

She also spent 5 minutes on each sudoku puzzle and she did 8 of them, so that's 8 x 5 = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time she spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles together: 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. We start with 120 liters and subtract 90 from it.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Now, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply the remaining water by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

The rainwater collected is 60 liters. To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the remaining water and the collected rainwater.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias.

First, we know that Andy plants 90 geraniums. 
Then, we know that he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, the number of petunias is 90 - 40 = 50.

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year.

The company spent $15000 on advertising in the first year. 

In the second year, they spent a third of that amount. To find a third of $15000, we can divide $15000 by 3. 

$15000 ÷ 3 = $5000

So, the company spent $5000 on advertising in the second year.

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year: $15000 + $5000 = $20000.

The final answer is: $20000"
"Let's figure out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals.

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour. He uses it for 3 hours, so we need to multiply 30 by 3 to find out how much he paid. 30 * 3 = 90. So, Carlos paid $90.

Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour. He uses it for 5 hours, so we need to multiply 18 by 5 to find out how much he paid. 18 * 5 = 90. So, Benji paid $90.

Now, we need to add the money Carlos and Benji paid to find the total. 90 + 90 = 180.

The final answer is: $180"
"So Andrew is going on a road trip from New Jersey to Rochester. He's going to take the bus one way and the car the other way. It takes 6 days to get to Rochester by bus. To get back, it takes half as many days by car. 

To find out how many days it takes to get back, we need to divide 6 by 2. 6 divided by 2 is 3. So it takes 3 days to get back by car.

Now, we need to add the days it takes to get there and the days it takes to get back. 6 days to get there plus 3 days to get back is 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's count James' Pokémon cards. He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. If he loses 8 of the water type and buys 14 grass type, we need to find out what's the chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type.

First, let's find out how many cards he has in total. We add the fire, grass, and water type cards together: 30 + 20 + 40 = 90.

Now, James loses 8 water type cards, so we subtract 8 from the water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32. And we subtract 8 from the total cards: 90 - 8 = 82.

Then, James buys 14 grass type cards, so we add 14 to the grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34. And we add 14 to the total cards: 82 + 14 = 96.

Now, let's find the chance of picking a water type card. We divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100: (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.333...%. 

Rounded to the nearest integer, the chance is 33%.

The final answer is: 33"
"Let's figure out how much Chad still owes for his burrito.

First, we need to add up the cost of the extra things he got. He got extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each. So, 2 * $0.25 is $0.50. Now we add all those costs together: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.

The base burrito costs $6.50, and the extra stuff costs $4.50, so the total cost of the meal is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.

Then, Chad upgraded his meal for $3.00, so now the total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we need to subtract that from the total. $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find out how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to finish the puzzle, we need to know how many pieces they can put together per minute. Kalinda can put together 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can put together half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is 2 pieces per minute.

So, together they can put together 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to put together 360 pieces. To do this, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate.

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

So, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to finish the puzzle.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's figure out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after two weeks.

First, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready to be harvested after two months. 30% of 120 is the same as 0.3 x 120. To find 30% of a number, we multiply it by 0.3. So, 0.3 x 120 = 36. This means 36 watermelons were ready to be harvested after two months.

Now, we need to find out how many watermelons were left after two months. We subtract the number of watermelons ready to be harvested from the total number of watermelons. So, 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were left.

Next, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready to be harvested after two weeks. 3/4 of 84 is the same as 0.75 x 84. To find 3/4 of a number, we multiply it by 0.75. So, 0.75 x 84 = 63. This means 63 watermelons were ready to be harvested after two weeks.

Finally, we need to find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after two weeks. We subtract the number of watermelons ready to be harvested from the number of watermelons left after two months. So, 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after two weeks.

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's figure out how much Mark paid for his cars.

First, we need to find out how much the cars cost in total. There are 12 cars and each one costs $20,000. So, we multiply 12 by $20,000.

12 x $20,000 = $240,000

Now, we need to add a 10% tax on the cars. 10% of something means 10 out of 100, or 0.1. So, we multiply $240,000 by 0.1.

$240,000 x 0.1 = $24,000

Next, we need to add a $1000 registration fee for each car. There are 12 cars, so we multiply 12 by $1000.

12 x $1000 = $12,000

Now, we add up the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fee.

$240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

The final answer is: $276,000"
"Let's figure out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday.

We know that Robert collects 20 shells on Monday. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so she collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.

25 * 2 = 50

So, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday."
"So, Dax went to the farm to pick some apples and found some bugs and ants in the garden. We know there were 50 ants. It's also mentioned that there were half as many bugs as ants. 

To find the number of bugs, we need to divide the number of ants by 2. 

Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects.

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's figure out how many penguins are left sunbathing. 

First, we need to find out how many penguins jumped in the ocean and went inside the cave. Since one-third of the penguins did both, we need to divide the total number of penguins by 3.

36 penguins divided by 3 is 12. So, 12 penguins jumped in the ocean and 12 penguins went inside the cave.

Now, we need to subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins to find out how many are left sunbathing. 

36 (total penguins) - 12 (penguins in the ocean) - 12 (penguins in the cave) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's figure out how many vines Steve needs for his cherry tomatoes.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day. To find out how many he eats in a week, we multiply 6 by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). 
6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week

Steve's girlfriend eats half as much as him, so she eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes a day. 
3 * 7 = 21 tomatoes per week

Together, they eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine: 
63 / 3 = 21 vines

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's figure out how many pizzas John needs to order. 

First, we need to know how many slices of pizza each friend will get. John wants each friend to have 4 slices. There are 20 friends in total, so we multiply 20 by 4 to find out the total number of slices needed.

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Now, we need to know how many slices are in one pizza. Pizzas are sold in 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas John needs, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza.

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"Let's figure this out. Ram buys 25 pens. He can make a new pen from the ink of 5 empty pens. So, from the 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, he has 5 empty pens left. He can use the ink from these 5 pens to make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen.

So, the total number of pens he gets is 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) + 1 (new pen) = 31 pens.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's figure out how much money Johnny had after a year.

First, Johnny got $20 as his allowance. Then, he added $10 more to it. So, he had $20 + $10 = $30.

Now, we know that the $30 tripled in a year. This means we need to multiply $30 by 3 to find the final amount.

$30 * 3 = $90

So, after a year, Johnny had $90."
"Let's figure out the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa.

We know Jessa is 20 years old. We also know that Joan is 5 years older than Jessa. To find Joan's age, we add 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25.

Now, we know Joan is 25 years old. We also know that Mary is 2 years younger than Joan. To find Mary's age, we subtract 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23.

So, Jessa is 20 years old, Joan is 25 years old, and Mary is 23 years old.

To find the sum of their ages, we add their ages together: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

There were 1000 students in the school hall. First, 30% of them went out through exit A. To find 30% of 1000, we multiply 0.3 by 1000. That's 0.3 x 1000 = 300 students.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left. We subtract 300 from 1000. 1000 - 300 = 700 students are left.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find 3/5 of 700, we multiply 3/5 by 700. That's (3/5) x 700 = 420 students.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left again. We subtract 420 from 700. 700 - 420 = 280 students are left.

These 280 students went out through exit C.

The final answer is: 280"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know John has 54 candies. We also know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. To find out how many candies Robert has, we need to divide the number of candies John has by 2. 

54 ÷ 2 = 27

So Robert has 27 candies. Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. To find out how many candies James has, we add 6 to the number of candies Robert has.

27 + 6 = 33

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. To do this, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has.

54 - 33 = 21

"Let's figure this out. Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. They both read their own books, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 books. But they also read each other's books. Dolly reads Pandora's book, and Pandora reads Dolly's book. So, Dolly reads 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books, and Pandora reads 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

So, in total, Dolly reads 3 books and Pandora reads 3 books. To find the total number of books read, we add 3 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's figure out how many hours Mike spends writing a week.

Mike has 3 pen pals left. Each of them sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, Mike gets 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week. Since each letter is 5 pages long, he gets 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike writes back to each of his pen pals, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes, he writes 60 pages in 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To find out how many hours Mike writes, we need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so we divide 360 by 60 to get 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's figure out how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan. He has a plan for 1000 minutes per month. He talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day, and he's had 300 extra minutes of calls this month.

First, let's find out how many minutes he used for his daily calls. Since there are 30 days in the month, we multiply 15 minutes by 30 days. That's 15 x 30 = 450 minutes.

Now, we add the extra minutes he used, which is 300 minutes. So, 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan. That's 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's figure out how many fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Griffin started with 24 fries. Then Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 x 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.

Let's say Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries. After that, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Then, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

To solve the equation, we need to get x by itself. We can do that by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7.

x = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's say there are x fish in each aquarium. Since there are two aquariums, the total number of fish is 2x.

We know that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 28. One aquarium has 4 snails and the other has 32 snails, so the difference is 32 - 4 = 28.

The problem says that this difference is twice the total number of fish. So, we can write an equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how much Jean paid, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find out how much she paid per day for makeup. She charges $250 an hour and it takes 6 hours to do her makeup each day. So, we multiply 250 by 6 to get the cost per day.

$250 * 6 = $1500

Since she needs her makeup done 4 times a week, we multiply the cost per day by 4.

$1500 * 4 = $6000

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so we multiply the cost for 4 days a week by 5.

$6000 * 5 = $30,000

After the movie is done, Jean gets a 10% discount. To find the discount, we multiply $30,000 by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%).

$30,000 * 0.1 = $3000

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid.

$30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid for Isabelle's little sister's birthday party, we need to add up the cost of all the party supplies.

First, let's add up the cost of the cake, presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags.

$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) = $55
$55 + $15 (decorations) = $70
$70 + $4 (invitations) = $74
$74 + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Now that we know the total cost is $96, we need to divide it by 3 since Isabelle and her two parents are splitting the cost evenly.

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

So, each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to know how much the onions weigh in total and then multiply that by how much they cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, we multiply 4 by 50 to find the total weight.

4 x 50 = 200 pounds

Now, we know the onions weigh 200 pounds. We also know that each pound costs $1.50. To find the total cost, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound.

200 x $1.50 = $300

The chef spent $300."
"Let's figure out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister.

We know that Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply the number of cookies her sister ate by 4. That's because Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday.

5 cookies (her sister's Monday cookies) * 4 = 20 cookies (Sue's Monday cookies)

Now, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday. We know she ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday. Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies Sue ate: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies

Her sister ate a total of 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, we can multiply the total number of cookies Sue ate by 200 to find out how many calories she consumed: 46 * 200 = 9200 calories

We can do the same for her sister: 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

Now, let's find the difference in calories consumed: 9200 (Sue's calories) - 3600 (her sister's calories) = 5600

The final answer is: 5600"
"Let's break this down step by step. We know that there are 3 classes in the school, and each class has 20 students. That means there are a total of 3 * 20 = 60 students in the school.

We also know that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that half of the students are boys and half are girls. So, the total number of boys and girls in the school is 60 / 2 = 30 each.

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Let's find out how many girls are in the school so far. 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

Since there are 30 girls in the school in total, and we already have 27 girls in the first two classes, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Now, we know that the third class has 3 girls. Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

So, the answer is 17."

"Let's figure out how many animals Rick killed.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's start with the cougars. Since he killed three fewer cougars today than last night, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's find out how many wolves he killed today. Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves today.

To find the total number of wolves killed, we add the wolves from last night and today: 10 + 36 = 46.

To find the total number of cougars killed, we add the cougars from last night and today: 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know that Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows. He wants to put an equal number of these new cows into each of the 10 stalls. To find out how many cows he puts in each stall, we divide the total number of new cows by the number of stalls.

40 cows / 10 stalls = 4 cows per stall

Now, we know that each stall already had 20 cows. So, if Mr. Sylas puts 4 new cows in each stall, we need to add these to the original number of cows.

20 (original cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

We want to know how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. To find this out, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

24 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 192 cows

The final answer is: 192"
"Let's count the money in Brady's piggy bank. 

First, we need to find out how much money he has in pennies. He has 100 pennies, and each penny is worth $0.01. So, we multiply 100 by $0.01 to get the total amount of money from pennies. That's 100 x $0.01 = $1.

Next, we need to find out how much money he has in nickels. He has 40 nickels, and each nickel is worth $0.05. So, we multiply 40 by $0.05 to get the total amount of money from nickels. That's 40 x $0.05 = $2.

Now, let's count the money from dimes. He has 20 dimes, and each dime is worth $0.10. So, we multiply 20 by $0.10 to get the total amount of money from dimes. That's 20 x $0.10 = $2.

Lastly, we need to count the money from dollar bills. He has 40 dollar bills, and each dollar bill is worth $1. So, we multiply 40 by $1 to get the total amount of money from dollar bills. That's 40 x $1 = $40.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to know how many 10-foot sections it has. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

But, termites ate 30% of the wood. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 0.3 * 8000 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000 to find the final weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find out how much Nancy has to pay, we need to add up the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, we need to find the cost of the overdue books. Nancy has 8 books that are overdue, and each one costs $0.50. So, we multiply 8 by $0.50 to get the total cost of the books.

8 x $0.50 = $4.00

Now, we need to add the flat fee of $2.00 to the cost of the books. This is because Nancy had at least one book that's over a week overdue.

$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Andrea has 52 apples. Since she has 8 more apples than Jamal, we need to find out how many apples Jamal has. To do that, we subtract 8 from 52, which is 44. So, Jamal has 44 apples.

Now, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Since he has 44 apples, we add 4 to that, which is 48. So, Jamal has 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. Since Jamal has 48 bananas, we divide 48 by 2, which is 24. So, Andrea has 24 bananas.

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits. We have 52 apples from Andrea, 44 apples from Jamal, 24 bananas from Andrea, and 48 bananas from Jamal. Let's add them all up: 52 + 44 + 24 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to know how many cookies she's making in total. She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so that's a total of 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

Since 12 cookies need 2 cups of flour, we need to find out how many sets of 12 cookies are in 66 cookies. We can do this by dividing 66 by 12. 

66 ÷ 12 = 5.5

This means Carla has 5 full sets of 12 cookies and 6 extra cookies. We need 2 cups of flour for each set of 12 cookies, so for 5 sets, that's 5 x 2 = 10 cups of flour.

For the 6 extra cookies, we need half a set of 12 cookies, which is half of 2 cups of flour, or 1 cup.

So, in total, Carla needs 10 + 1 = 11 cups of flour.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first find two thirds of 9,300. 

To do this, we can multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

9,300 * 2 = 18,600

Now, we divide 18,600 by 3:

18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

The final answer is: $62"
"Let's figure out how many marbles Maddison has now. She has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. To find out how many marbles she has in total, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box.

5 boxes * 50 marbles = 250 marbles

Then, she gets 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, we need to add the marbles she already has to the marbles she received.

250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

So, Maddison has 270 marbles now."
"Let's figure this out step by step. Chris has 6 trees in his yard. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. To find half of 6, we divide 6 by 2, which is 3. So, Ferdinand has 3 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

So, Harry has 11 trees. To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much money the three girls have combined, we need to add up their individual amounts.

Carmen has $100. 
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up their individual amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000. 

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. To find 5% of $350,000, we multiply 0.05 by $350,000. This is the same as multiplying 5 by $350,000, which is $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price. To find 12% of $350,000, we multiply 0.12 by $350,000. This is the same as multiplying 12 by $350,000, which is $42,000.

Now, we add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee together. $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find the difference between the total price and her budget, we subtract $400,000 from $409,500. This is $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how much money Mr. Tan has left after selling his house, we need to subtract the fees and the loan from the selling price.

First, let's find out how much the transfer fees are. 3% of $400,000 is the same as 3/100 * $400,000. To find 3/100, we can divide 3 by 100, which is 0.03. So, 0.03 * $400,000 is $12,000.

Next, we need to find out how much the brokerage fee is. 5% of $400,000 is the same as 5/100 * $400,000. To find 5/100, we can divide 5 by 100, which is 0.05. So, 0.05 * $400,000 is $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee together. $12,000 + $20,000 is $32,000.

Now, we subtract the total fees from the selling price. $400,000 - $32,000 is $368,000.

Finally, we subtract the loan from the selling price. $368,000 - $250,000 is $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find out how long it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees, we need to figure out 40% of 20 minutes. 40% is the same as 0.4, so we multiply 0.4 by 20. 

0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to cook. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to heat up the oil. So, we subtract 5 from 28.

28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

To find the total time, we add the time it took to heat up to 300 degrees, the time it took to heat up to 400 degrees, and the time it took to cook.

20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: 71"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we need to multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads. The cost of each newspaper ad is $5 and the agent bought 50 ads, so $5 * 50 = $250.

Next, we need to find the total amount spent on television ads. The cost of each television ad is $75 and the agent bought 15 ads, so $75 * 15 = $1125.

Now, we need to add the total spent on newspaper ads and television ads to find the total amount spent on all ads. $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"So, let's figure this out. The juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of those balls are golf balls. To find out how many golf balls there are, we need to divide 16 by 2.

16 / 2 = 8

So, there are 8 golf balls. Now, we need to find out how many of those golf balls are blue. Since half of the golf balls are blue, we need to divide 8 by 2.

8 / 2 = 4

So, there are 4 blue golf balls."
"Let's figure out how many M&Ms Mary got in total.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

Now, let's talk about the third bag. It has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag. To find half of 300, we need to divide 300 by 2. 300 divided by 2 is 150.

So, the first bag has 300 M&Ms, the second bag has 312 M&Ms, and the third bag has 150 M&Ms. To find the total number of M&Ms, we need to add them together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

Now, each bedroom has 2 windows. To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we multiply 6 bedrooms by 2 windows, which is 12.

But wait, there are also some windows in each house that aren't in the bedrooms. There are 4 of those windows in each house. Since there are 2 houses, we multiply 2 houses by 4 windows to get 8.

Now, we add the windows in the bedrooms (12) and the extra windows (8) to get the total number of windows. 12 + 8 = 20.

"To find out how much change the cashier gives back, we need to add up the cost of all the things the mother bought.

The cost of the cocoa is $4.20, the laundry is $9.45, and the pasta is $1.35. 

First, let's add the cost of the cocoa and the laundry: $4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65
Now, let's add the cost of the pasta to that: $13.65 + $1.35 = $14.00

So, the total cost of all the items is $14.00. Now, we need to find out how much change the cashier gives back. The mother paid $20, so we need to subtract the total cost from the amount she paid.

$20 - $14.00 = $6.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that number, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

Next, the rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we need to find out how many stitches are left for the sleeves. The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

The whole sweater has 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches. So, the total number of stitches left for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we need to divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes. 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to figure out how many lines are in each part and add them up.

The song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice as many lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. But only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up all the lines: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we have 80 cards in total. 

2/5 of the cards have the letter A on them. To find 2/5 of 80, we multiply 80 by 2 and then divide by 5. So, 80 * 2 = 160, and 160 / 5 = 32. That means 32 cards have the letter A.

Now, we have 80 - 32 = 48 cards left. Half of these cards have the letter B. To find half of 48, we divide 48 by 2. 48 / 2 = 24. So, 24 cards have the letter B.

We have 48 - 24 = 24 cards left. Now, 5/8 of these cards have the letter C. To find 5/8 of 24, we multiply 24 by 5 and then divide by 8. So, 24 * 5 = 120, and 120 / 8 = 15. That means 15 cards have the letter C.

Now, we have 24 - 15 = 9 cards left. These cards have the letter D.

"To find out how long it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to figure out how long it takes him to dig the small holes and the large holes, and then add them together.

First, let's find out how long it takes him to dig the small holes. He digs a small hole in 3 minutes, and he needs to dig 30 small holes. So, we multiply 3 minutes by 30 holes: 3 x 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, let's find out how long it takes him to dig the large holes. He digs a large hole in 10 minutes, and he needs to dig 15 large holes. So, we multiply 10 minutes by 15 holes: 10 x 15 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to dig the small holes and the large holes together: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To make it easier to understand, we can convert the total minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 240 minutes by 60: 240 ÷ 60 = 4 hours.

"Let's say Mico's age is M and Marco's age is m. We know that M + m = 20.

In 10 years, Mico will be M + 10 years old, and Marco will be m + 10 years old. To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add their ages together: (M + 10) + (m + 10).

We can simplify this by adding the numbers together: (M + m) + 10 + 10. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can replace M + m with 20: 20 + 10 + 10.

Now, let's add the numbers: 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. If we let Sam's age be S, then Ruby's age is 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby will be 6S + 9 years old, and Sam will be S + 9 years old. We are told that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write the equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's simplify the equation. We can start by adding 9 to both sides:

6S + 9 + 9 = 3S + 9 + 9

"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to add up the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars.

First, let's find the cost of the popsicles. There are 20 popsicles and each one costs $0.25. So, we multiply 20 by $0.25 to get the total cost of the popsicles.

20 * $0.25 = $5

Next, we need to find the cost of the ice cream bars. There are 4 ice cream bars and each one costs $0.50. So, we multiply 4 by $0.50 to get the total cost of the ice cream bars.

4 * $0.50 = $2

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars together to get the total amount Peter paid.

$5 + $2 = $7

The final answer is: $7"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many spots are on all the cobras. There are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots. To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply 40 by 70. 

40 * 70 = 2800

Now, we need to find out how many spots are on all the mambas. There are 60 mambas and each mamba has half the number of spots as a cobra. Since a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450

The final answer is: 2450"
"Maddy is buying pizza for her cousin's soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests. A pizza will serve 3 people. If each pizza costs $15, how many dollars will Maddy spend?

First, we need to find out how many people Maddy needs to buy pizza for. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's 15 people. Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 x 2 = 24 guests. In total, Maddy needs to buy pizza for 15 + 24 = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy. 39 ÷ 3 = 13 pizzas.

Now, we need to find out how much money Maddy will spend. Each pizza costs $15, so we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost of each pizza. 13 x 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to figure out how much space the topaz gemstones take up and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them. So, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The necklace is 25 inches long. To find out how much space is left for the silver beads, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many silver beads fit in that 17-inch space. Each silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many beads fit, we divide the space by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 / 0.25 = 68.

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 68"
"Let's figure out how many stories Alani, Braylen, and Margot wrote altogether. 

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. Her brother Braylen wrote 40 stories, and her sister Margot wrote 60 stories. 

If we add those up, we get 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories in the first week.

In the second week, they each wrote double the number of stories they wrote in the first week. So Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the stories from the second week: 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we need to add the stories from the first week and the second week. So, 120 + 240 = 360.

So, Ann's brother is 18 years old now. In 3 years, he will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's figure out how much money Kelly has. She has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 
Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

To find the total amount Kelly has, we add the value of the quarters and dimes together: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Now, Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

So, Kelly has 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to know how many stars are in the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so that's 3 x 8 = 24 stars.
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 stars.

Now, let's add those together: 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, we can find the number of rows by dividing 40 by 5: 40 ÷ 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many trucks are needed to transport the flagstones, we need to know how much they weigh in total and how much each truck can carry.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If there are 80 flagstones, we multiply 80 by 75 to get the total weight:
80 * 75 = 6000 pounds

Now, we need to know how much each truck can carry. The trucks can carry 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight by the weight each truck can carry:
6000 / 2000 = 3

So, 3 trucks are needed to transport the flagstones.

"To find out how long it took the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we need to know its speed. We know the car in the fast lane is going 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is going half that speed. 

So, the car in the slow lane is going 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.

Now, we can use a simple formula to find the time: time = distance / speed. 

Plugging in the numbers, we get: time = 480 miles / 30 miles per hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's figure out how many medals have been given out for counting.

Ali has 22 medals. His friend Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

We know that together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let's call the total number of medals given out ""x"". Then, 10x = 39.

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.9}$"
"Let's figure out how many chocolate bars each child will get.

First, we need to know how many chocolate bars there are in total. There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars. So, we multiply 8 packets by 5 chocolate bars/packet to get the total number of chocolate bars: 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. There are 4 adults, so we multiply 4 adults by 6 chocolate bars/adult to find out how many chocolate bars the adults get: 4 * 6 = 24.

To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the kids, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults got from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars among the 8 kids. To do this, we divide 16 chocolate bars by 8 kids: 16 ÷ 8 = 2.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's figure out how much money Susan earns for her online task.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. That's 3 hours. But she takes a break for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

We need to convert 2.5 hours to minutes because Susan earns money every 10 minutes. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, let's find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval. So, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

"Let's figure out how many points the three friends have in total after the extra points had been distributed.

Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's see who gets an extra point in the fourth round. 
If you have more than 20 points, you get an extra point. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

"Let's figure this out. Will buys 15 oranges. His oldest son is 8 years old, and his youngest son is half as old as the oldest son. 

To find out how old the youngest son is, we need to divide 8 by 2. 8 divided by 2 is 4. So, the youngest son is 4 years old.

Now, we need to find out how many oranges the sons wash. The oldest son washes 8 oranges because he's 8 years old. The youngest son washes 4 oranges because he's 4 years old.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to subtract the number of oranges washed from the total. 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

"Let's figure out how many exercises Darren did in two days.

On the first day, Darren did 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. That's a total of 100 + 50 + 20 = 170 exercises.

On the second day, he did 20 more pushups than the first day, so that's 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He did 10 fewer squats, so that's 50 - 10 = 40 squats. And he doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Now, let's add up the exercises for the second day: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 exercises.

So, in total, Darren did 170 + 200 = 370 exercises in two days.

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to know how much rice is eaten per day. Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice for each meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person eats 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

If there are 5 people in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice eaten per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount eaten per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

"Let's figure out how many crates Sam was off from his target.

Sam wanted to sell 120 crates of bread in a week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any bread on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

To find out how many crates he sold in total, we need to add up all the crates he sold. 

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) = 35
35 + 12 (Wednesday) = 47
47 + 18 (Thursday) = 65

So, Sam sold 65 crates in total. Now, we need to find out how many crates he was off from his target. To do that, we subtract the total crates he sold from his target.

120 (target) - 65 (total crates sold) = 55

Sam was 55 crates off from his target.

"Let's figure out how much the desk costs. Carmen starts with a bid of $200. Then, 3 other people bid, and after each of their bids, Carmen bids again. So, there are 3 bids from the other people and 3 bids from Carmen, making a total of 6 bids.

Each time someone bids, the price goes up by $50. We need to find the total cost of the desk. To do this, we can add up all the bids. The first bid is $200, the second bid is $250, the third bid is $300, the fourth bid is $350, the fifth bid is $400, and the sixth bid is $450.

Let's add these numbers together: $200 + $250 = $450, $450 + $300 = $750, $750 + $350 = $1100, $1100 + $400 = $1500, and $1500 + $450 = $1950.

The desk costs $1950."
"To find out how much John pays for driving to work each year, we need to do some math.

First, we need to figure out how many miles John drives in a year. He drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, so that's 60 miles per day. He goes to work 5 days a week, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week. Since there are 50 weeks in a year, he drives 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Now, we need to find out how much it costs John to drive 15000 miles. He gets charged $2 per mile, so it costs him 15000 miles * $2/mile = $30000 per year.

But that's not all. John also gives his driver a $150 bonus every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he gives his driver 12 months * $150/month = $1800 per year.

So, to find the total cost, we add the driving cost and the bonus. $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

The final answer is: $31800"

"To make a 32-page tabloid, you need to fold a piece of paper in half. When you fold it, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper.

Imagine you have a piece of paper with 32 pages. You can print the pages like this:

- The first page is on the left back.
- The second page is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back.
- The 31st page is on the right front.

This keeps going until you reach the middle of the paper. Then, the pattern reverses.

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half, you need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages (left and right sides) and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages (left and right sides).

So, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 + 2 = 4.

Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks. To find half of $50, we need to divide 50 by 2. That's 50 ÷ 2 = 25.

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. Then, she spent an extra $10 on rides. That's a total of $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, we need to find out how much money she has left. To do that, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount. That's $50 - $35 = $15.

"Let's figure out how much money Elise made from selling her dad's books in the second year.

We know that Elise has 250 books in total. She has 50 books left unsold, so she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We also know that she sold 45 books this year. That means she sold 200 - 45 = 155 books in the first year and the second year combined.

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the second year, let's call the number of books she sold in the second year ""x"". Then, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2x.

We know that 2x + x = 155, because that's the total number of books she sold in the first and second year. We can solve for x by adding x to 2x and getting 3x = 155. Then, we divide both sides by 3 to get x = 51.5.

But we can't sell half a book, so we know that Elise must have sold 52 books in the second year (rounding up from 51.5).

Since each book sells for $20, Elise made 52 * 20 = $1040 in the second year.

The final answer is: $1040"

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. So, let's calculate how many hours he works in a week:
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Watson earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Since he beat 80% of the people, that means he lost to the other 20%. To find 20% of 20, we multiply 0.2 by 20.

0.2 * 20 = 4

So, John lost to 4 people."
"Let's figure out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day. In the morning, they sell two-thirds of the loaves. To find two-thirds of 60, we can multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 3.

60 * 2 = 120
120 / 3 = 40

So, they sell 40 loaves in the morning. Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left. We subtract the morning sales from the total.

60 - 40 = 20

Now, we know that half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. To find half of 20, we multiply 20 by 1 and then divide by 2.

"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to figure out how much weight Joey loses per week. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to figure out how many weeks it takes Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 pounds by 2 pounds per week to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds: 8 pounds / 2 pounds per week = 4 weeks.

The answer is 4."
"To find out how much you'll save, we need to calculate the savings on the ice cream and the milk separately and then add them together.

First, let's look at the ice cream. If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream that cost $13 each, the total cost is 2 x $13 = $26. If you buy them at the discounted price of $11 each, the total cost is 2 x $11 = $22. So, you save $26 - $22 = $4 on the ice cream.

Next, let's look at the milk. If you buy 4 packets of milk that cost $1 each, the total cost is 4 x $1 = $4. If you buy them at the discounted price of $0.5 each, the total cost is 4 x $0.5 = $2. So, you save $4 - $2 = $2 on the milk.

To find the total savings, we add the savings on the ice cream and the milk together: $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's figure out how many new limbs Helena's serum will make a person grow after 15 days.

The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many extra arms they'll grow, we need to divide 15 by 3. 

15 ÷ 3 = 5

So, they'll grow 5 extra arms.

The serum also makes a person grow an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many extra legs they'll grow, we need to divide 15 by 5.

15 ÷ 5 = 3

So, they'll grow 3 extra legs.

Now, let's add the extra arms and legs together to find the total number of new limbs.

5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's figure out how much money Theo has left to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

First, we need to know how much money he spent on business suits. He bought 6 suits at $100 each, so that's 6 x $100 = $600.

Next, he bought 3 suitcases at $50 each, which is 3 x $50 = $150.

Then, he bought a flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that is $500. So, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up how much he spent on suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket. That's $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo started with $6000, so he has $6000 - $1950 = $4050 left.

He wants to save $2000, so he has $4050 - $2000 = $2050 left to spend on gifts.

The final answer is: $50"
"Let's figure out how many eggs the family will eat in a week.

There are 5 people in the family. Three of them eat 3 eggs each day, and the other 2 eat 2 eggs each day. 

First, let's find out how many eggs the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day eat in a day. That's 3 x 3 = 9 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs the other 2 people eat in a day. That's 2 x 2 = 4 eggs.

So, in a day, the family eats 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply 13 eggs by 7 to find out how many eggs they eat in a week. That's 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's figure out how old Trent is. We know that Quinn is 30 years old. We also know that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. To find Jane's age, we need to subtract 3 from 30. 

30 - 3 = 27

So, Jane is 27 years old. Now, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. To find Trent's age, we need to add 5 to Jane's age.

27 + 5 = 32

Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Cera is 46 years old now. Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old at that time.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

We also know that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. This means the current population is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's say the number of players on the defense is D. We know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is 2D.

We also know that there are half as many players on the special teams as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

The total number of players on the team is 105. We can add up the number of players on the offense, defense, and special teams to get 105:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To make it easier to solve, let's multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Now, let's combine the D's:

7D = 210

To find out what D is, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's figure out how many people are going to Martha's party.

First, we need to find out how many people Martha invited. She invited 2 families with 6 people in each family, and 3 families with 4 people in each family. 

2 families with 6 people: 2 x 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 x 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

Now, 8 people couldn't come because they're sick. So, we subtract 8 from 24: 24 - 8 = 16 people

But, 1/4 of the people who were sick had other plans, and that's 1/4 of 8, which is 2 people. So, we subtract 2 from 16: 16 - 2 = 14 people

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna. Then, he added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

Now, Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find 2/5 of 20, we multiply 20 by 2 and then divide by 5. 20 * 2 = 40, and 40 / 5 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, we add the marbles his father gave him to the total number of marbles in the store: 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to know the pool's volume. The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. 

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular pool is length x width x height. 

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost. It costs $0.1 per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"So, let's figure this out. We know there are 30 boys in the classroom. We also know that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. To find out how many girls there are, we multiply the number of boys by 3.

Girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Now, we know that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find out how many nongendered children there are, we multiply the number of boys by 1/10.

Nongendered children = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add up the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children in the classroom.

Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the number of electric poles needed, we need to use the ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. We know that the total number of electric wires needed is 45.

We can set up an equation to solve for x:

3x = 45

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's figure out how many women are left at the party.

First, we need to know how many people were at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so that's a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the people left. To find out how many people left, we need to multiply 40 by 1/4. That's the same as dividing 40 by 4, which is 10.

So, 10 people left the party. That means there are 40 - 10 = 30 people left.

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. That means 25 - 22 = 3 men left. Since 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Now, we know that 15 women were at the party at the beginning, and 7 of them left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to know the cost of the magazine first. We know the book costs $4, and the magazine costs half as much as the book. So, we divide $4 by 2 to find the cost of the magazine.

$4 ÷ 2 = $2

Now that we know the magazine costs $2, we need to find the cost of the pen. We know the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, we subtract $1 from $2.

$2 - $1 = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's figure out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils.

First, we know that Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which makes a total of 26 pencils. We can find out how many pencils are in each box by subtracting the loose pencils from the total and then dividing by the number of boxes.

26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils
24 pencils / 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box

Now, we know that each box has 8 pencils. We need to find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

72 (total pencils) / 8 (pencils per box) = 9

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to figure out how many ice cubes she needs to cool it down and how much cream she adds.

First, we need to find out how many ice cubes she needs to cool the coffee. The coffee needs to cool down 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To find out how many ice cubes she needs, we divide 65 by 13. 

65 ÷ 13 = 5

So, Shannon needs 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since she needs 5 ice cubes, the coffee becomes 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream to the coffee. This makes the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

Now, we add the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream. 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"So, let's say 5 people go to Ralph's record store and they trade in their old records for new ones. They end up leaving with 7 new records. We need to figure out how many old records they brought in.

Since they can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, that means for every 2 old records, they get 1 new record. So, if they got 7 new records, they must have traded in 2 times 7 old records.

2 times 7 is 14. So, they must have brought in 14 old records."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many junior programmers there are. We know that junior programmers make up 2/5 of the total number of employees. There are 100 employees in total, so we multiply 100 by 2/5.

100 x 2/5 = 40

So, there are 40 junior programmers. That means there are 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Now, let's find out how much money the company pays to the junior programmers. Each junior programmer makes $2000 per month, and there are 40 of them.

40 x $2000 = $80000

Next, we need to find out how much money the company pays to the senior programmers. We know that senior programmers make $400 more than junior programmers, so they make $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

There are 60 senior programmers, so we multiply 60 by $2400.

60 x $2400 = $144000

Now, we add the money paid to junior programmers and senior programmers to find the total amount of money the company pays to all programmers.

$80000 + $144000 = $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"Let's solve this problem step by step. 

We know that at the third bus stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Before that, 8 people got on the bus at the second stop. So, at the second stop, there were 20 - 8 = 12 people on the bus.

At the second stop, 7 people got off the bus, so before that, there were 12 + 7 = 19 people on the bus.

Now, we know that 5 people got on the bus at the first stop. So, before that, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

This means that 14 people were on the bus when it started, which is when they got on at the terminal.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's figure out how many lollipops Oscar has left.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

Then, he passes 14 out to his friends. That means he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

After that, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. He gave 14 to his friends, so he buys 2 x 14 = 28 more lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

The next day, he eats 3 more lollipops. So, he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning. That leaves him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is: 31"
"So, let's say your phone is at 60% charged. To get it to 100% charged, you need to add 40% more. 

The phone charges 1 percentage point every 3 minutes. To find out how long it takes to charge 40%, we multiply 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

Now, we need to convert 120 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 120 by 60.

120 / 60 = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge your phone."
"Let's figure out how many lollipops Erin has left. Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mom gives her 10 more, so now she has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to subtract 3 from 17. That's like taking away 3 from 17. We can do that by counting down: 17, 16, 15, 14. So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's figure out how much the customer paid on their shopping trip.

First, we need to find out how many rewards the customer got from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 they spend, they get a reward. So, we divide $80 by $20 to find out how many rewards they got. $80 ÷ $20 = 4 rewards.

Now, let's go back to the current shopping trip. They spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they got $4 off the price.

The customer also used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Twice the amount of rewards is 2 x $4 = $8.

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much the customer paid, we subtract the discount from the amount they spent. $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's figure out which job pays more money after taxes.

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year. That's a total of $15 * 2000 = $30,000 per year. But we have to pay taxes on that. The state has a 20% tax rate, so we subtract 20% of $30,000 from $30,000. 20% of $30,000 is 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000. So, after taxes, Job A pays $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B pays $42,000 per year, but we have to pay $6,000 in property tax. That leaves us with $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Then, we have to pay 10% of $36,000 in taxes. 10% of $36,000 is 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600. So, after taxes, Job B pays $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, let's compare the two jobs. Job B pays $32,400 and Job A pays $24,000. To find out how much more Job B pays, we subtract $24,000 from $32,400. That's $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of ruined castles in Scotland, we need to calculate 40% of 220. 

40% is the same as 0.4, so we multiply 0.4 by 220.

0.4 * 220 = 88

Now, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find half of 88, we divide 88 by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"Let's figure out the cost difference between two offers from Furniture United and Cozy Homes.

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. To find the total cost, we need to add the advance payment and the total of the monthly installments. The total of the monthly installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. So, the total cost of Furniture United's offer is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. To find the total cost, we need to add the advance payment and the total of the monthly installments. The total of the monthly installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. So, the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers. We subtract the cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the cost of Furniture United's offer: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"Let's figure out how many paintball guns each person would have if they shared them equally. 

First, we need to count how many guns they have in total. DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 

8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

Now, we need to divide the total number of guns by the number of people. There are 4 people. 

24 ÷ 4 = 6

So, if they shared the guns equally, each person would have 6 paintball guns."
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

First, let's find out how much sugar Mason needs for the suckers. Since he needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers, he will need 8 times that amount for 8 batches. 8 x 30 is 240.

Now, let's find out how much sugar Mason needs for the fudge. He needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge.

To find the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the sugar needed for the fudge. 240 + 70 is 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"Let's figure out the final value of Maria's shares.

First, we need to find out how much the price of each share goes up and down. The price of each share starts at $8.

The price goes up 50% in the first year. To find 50% of $8, we multiply 8 by 0.5 (since 50% is the same as 0.5). So, 8 * 0.5 = 4. This means the price goes up by $4.

Now, we add the increase to the original price: $8 + $4 = $12. So, the price of each share after the first year is $12.

Next, the price goes down 25% in the second year. To find 25% of $12, we multiply 12 by 0.25 (since 25% is the same as 0.25). So, 12 * 0.25 = 3. This means the price goes down by $3.

Now, we subtract the decrease from the price after the first year: $12 - $3 = $9. So, the price of each share after the second year is $9.

Maria has 8 shares, and each share is worth $9. To find the total value of all her shares, we multiply the number of shares by the price of each share: 8 * 9 = 72.

The final answer is: $72"

Now, John ate half the amount Thomas ate, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's say we have 3 groups of students. Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than the other two. We need to find out how many students are in the smallest group.

Let's call the number of students in the two equal groups ""x"". Then, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in all three groups is 200. So, we can write an equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Now that we know x is 70, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x: 
70 - 10 = 60

So, the smallest group has 60 students.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, and they are either chickens or cows. We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's say the number of cows is C. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is 2C.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write an equation: C + 2C = 60. This is because the total number of animals is the sum of the number of cows and the number of chickens.

Combining like terms, we get 3C = 60. To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, which gives us C = 20.

Now that we know the number of cows is 20, we can find the number of chickens by multiplying 2 and 20, which is 40.

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. To find the total number of legs of the chickens, we multiply 2 and 40, which is 80. To find the total number of legs of the cows, we multiply 4 and 20, which is 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"Josh starts juggling 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, he has 3 + 4 = 7 balls.

"Let's figure out the total weight of the container and the animals inside it.

We know that a pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad. Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, all three of these animals weigh 50 pounds.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds

The final answer is: 260"
"So, Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits. Then, she got twice as many outfits at her baby shower, which is 2 x 24 = 48 outfits. That's a total of 24 + 48 = 72 outfits from her friend and the baby shower.

Her mom also gave her 15 more outfits. To find the total number of outfits, we add 72 and 15 together. 

72 + 15 = 87

"To find out how far Tyson runs in a day, we need to add 1/5 of 5000 meters to 5000 meters. 

1/5 of 5000 is 1000. 

So, we add 1000 to 5000, which is 6000 meters. 

Tyson runs 6000 meters every day. 

Since there are 30 days in June, we multiply 6000 by 30 to find the total distance. 

6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"Let's figure this out. We have three juice boxes: A, B, and C. Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. 

Now, let's find out how much Juice Box C costs. It's 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we need to subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C. That's 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to count the legs of the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs.

First, let's count the legs of the tables with 4 legs. There are 40 tables with 4 legs each, so we multiply 40 by 4 to get the total number of legs: 40 * 4 = 160 legs.

Next, let's count the legs of the tables with 3 legs. There are 50 tables with 3 legs each, so we multiply 50 by 3 to get the total number of legs: 50 * 3 = 150 legs.

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of tables: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

The final answer is: 310"
"Let's figure out how many cookies Jenny eats.

Jenny buys a bag of cookies that has 36 cookies. Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 x 5 = 20 cookies.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 x 7 = 7 cookies.

In total, her son and husband eat 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to subtract the cookies eaten by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in the bag. 

36 - 27 = 9

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we need to first find out how much he saved with the discount. The discount is 40% of the original price of the shirts, which is $30 each.

40% of $30 is the same as 0.4 x $30. To find 0.4 x $30, we multiply 0.4 by 30.

0.4 x 30 = 12

So, Davos saved $12 on each shirt. Now, we need to find the price of one shirt after the discount. To do this, we subtract the discount from the original price.

Original price of one shirt = $30
Discount = $12
Price of one shirt after discount = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the price of one shirt after the discount by 2 to find the total cost.

Price of one shirt after discount = $18
Number of shirts = 2
Total cost = $18 x 2 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"Let's figure out the percentage more they're making per day now.

First, we need to find out how much money they made per day when they made tractors. They sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor, so they made 10 x $100 = $1000 per day.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo, so they make 5 x $220 = $1100 per day.

To find the difference, we subtract the old amount from the new amount: $1100 - $1000 = $100.

Now, we need to find the percentage increase. To do this, we divide the difference by the old amount and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

So, they're making 10% more per day now.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to know how much she spends per month and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's figure out how much she spends on food per month. Food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, we multiply $25 by 4 to get the total cost of food per month.

$25 * 4 = $100

Now, we need to add the cost of treats and medicine to the food cost. Treats cost $20 per month, and medicine costs $100 per month. So, we add these costs to the food cost.

$100 + $20 + $100 = $220

Now, we multiply the total cost per month by 12 to get the total cost per year.

$220 * 12 = $2640

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find out how many hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to add up the time for each activity.

On Monday, Peyton has a yoga class that lasts 1 hour. On Tuesday, she has a cooking class that lasts 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so that's 3 hours. On Wednesday, she has a cheese-tasting event that lasts 0.5 hours. On Thursday, she has a museum tour that lasts half as long as the cooking class, so that's 1.5 hours. And on Friday, she has 2 hours of errands.

Let's add up the time for all activities:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The final answer is: 7.5"
"April is donating plant pots to a school for their garden. They need 30 pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. So, they need 30 + (2 * 30) pots for the roses. 

2 * 30 is 60, so they need 30 + 60 = 90 pots in total.

April already bought 100 pots, so we need to find out how many she has left over. To do that, we subtract the number of pots they need from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

So, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"Let's figure out how much money Andrea saved.

Andrea started with $36. She spent $11 on a sweater, so she had $36 - $11 = $25 left. Then, she gave her brother $4, so she had $25 - $4 = $21 left.

To find out how much she saved, we need to subtract the amount she had left from the amount she started with. 

Initial amount: $36
Amount after saving: $21

Amount saved = Initial amount - Amount after saving
Amount saved = $36 - $21
Amount saved = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's figure out how much time John spent sightseeing.

First, we need to find out how much time John spent doing other things. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, he spent 6 + 3 = 9 hours doing those two things.

He also watched 3 shows, and each show was 2 hours long. So, he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

Now, we add up the time he spent boating, swimming, and watching shows: 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

We know that watching shows took up 30% of his total time. Let's call his total time ""x"". We can write an equation to represent this:

30% of x = 6 hours

To find 30% of x, we multiply x by 0.30. So, the equation becomes:

0.30x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.30:

x = 6 / 0.30
x = 20

So, John's total time was 20 hours.

Now, we need to find out how much time he spent sightseeing. We know that sightseeing took up 40% of his total time. We can write an equation to represent this:

40% of 20 = x

To find 40% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.40:

x = 0.40 * 20
x = 8

So, John spent 8 hours sightseeing.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's figure out how much money Annabelle still needs to save for her phone.

First, we need to know how much money she already has. She has $80.

Annabelle works two jobs. At her first job, she earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours. To find out how much she earns, we multiply the number of hours she works by her hourly wage:
$10/hour * 20 hours = $200

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours. To find out how much she earns, we multiply the number of hours she works by her hourly wage:
$5/hour * 15 hours = $75

Now, we add the money she earns from both jobs:
$200 + $75 = $275

So, Annabelle earns a total of $275 from her two jobs.

To find out how much more money she needs to save, we subtract the money she already has from the cost of the phone:
$400 - $275 = $125

Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"Let's figure out how tall the tallest tree is. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Now, we need to find the total height of the two shorter trees. We add 6 and 11 together: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice as tall as the two shorter trees combined. So, we multiply 17 by 2: 17 * 2 = 34 feet.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's figure out how much money Dean has left.

First, we need to find out how much Dean spent on toy cars. He bought 6 toy cars and each one costs $2. So, 6 x 2 = 12. That's how much he spent on toy cars.

Next, we need to find out how much Dean spent on teddy bears. He bought 5 teddy bears and each one costs $1. So, 5 x 1 = 5. That's how much he spent on teddy bears.

Now, let's add the money he spent on toy cars and teddy bears. 12 + 5 = 17. That's how much Dean spent in total.

Dean's mom gave him $28 and then gave him an extra $10. So, he now has 28 + 10 = 38 dollars.

To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he has. 38 - 17 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. 

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $35 = 1.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.57 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $55 - $5 = $50.

"Marisa gets $5 every day from her parents as pocket money. She buys 4 lollipops for 25 cents each every day. To find out how much money she saves, we need to first find out how much she spends on lollipops.

4 lollipops cost 25 cents each, so we multiply 4 by 25 cents. 
4 x 25 cents = 100 cents
Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 100 cents to dollars by dividing by 100.
100 cents / 100 = $1

Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day.
Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days.
Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's figure out how many pounds of candy Billy bought.

Billy had $10 to spend on candy. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. If he spent x pounds of candy, then he spent 1.5x dollars on candy.

To find out how much money he had left, we subtract the cost of the candy from the $10 he started with: 10 - 1.5x.

After buying the candy, Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's figure out how old Carver's son is. We know that Carver is 45 years old, and his son is 5 years younger than twice Carver's age. 

If we let 'x' be the son's age, we can write an equation to solve for 'x'. The equation would be: 2x - 5 = 45

To find 'x', we need to get it by itself on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the -5 on the left side.

2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Now, we need to get rid of the 2 that's being multiplied by 'x'. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to know how far it travels in one day and how far it can go before needing a service.

First, let's figure out how far the train travels in one trip. It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 125 miles from the third city to the first city (since 75 + 100 - 50 = 125). 

So, the total distance in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, it travels 300 * 3 = 900 miles in one day.

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for the train to travel 18,000 miles. To do this, we divide 18,000 by 900.

18,000 / 900 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much stuffing Mark needs, we need to know how much stuffing each type of dog bed needs. A Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing, a chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing, and a collie bed needs the average of the first two.

To find the average, we add the two numbers and divide by 2. So, 8 + 2 = 10, and 10 / 2 = 5. This means a collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing.

Now, we need to find out how much stuffing Mark needs for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. For the chihuahua beds, we multiply 4 by 2, which is 8. For the collie beds, we multiply 3 by 5, which is 15.

To find the total amount of stuffing needed, we add 8 and 15 together. 8 + 15 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how long John's trip took, we need to figure out how long it took him to drive to his friend's house and how long it took him to drive back home.

First, let's find out how long it took him to drive to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at 70 miles per hour. To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed: 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours (we round this to 2.9 hours for simplicity).

But John had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance to his friend's house is 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles. Now, we need to find the time it took him to drive this distance at 70 mph: 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Now, let's find out how long it took him to drive back home. The distance back home is 240 miles, and he drives at 80 mph. To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed: 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

So, the total time it took John for the trip is 3 hours (to his friend's house) + 3 hours (back home) = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to know how many boys were there in the first place. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. 

So, the number of boys is 96 - 43 = 53.

Now, we know that 5 girls and 4 boys were absent on Friday. To find out how many boys were there on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of absent boys
= 53 - 4
= 49

The final answer is: 49"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice as many boys as girls, we need to find out how many boys are there. Since there are twice as many boys, we multiply the number of girls by 2. 

6 girls * 2 = 12 boys

Now, we need to find the total number of kids in the park. To do that, we add the number of girls and boys together.

6 (girls) + 12 (boys) = 18

So, there are 18 kids in the park.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many points Jane needs on her third test, we need to know how many points she has already gotten and how many she needs in total.

Jane got 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test. So, she has 15 + 18 = 33 points so far.

We know that Jane needs a total of 42 points to pass. To find out how many points she needs on her third test, we subtract the points she has from the total points she needs:

42 (total points needed) - 33 (points she has so far) = 9

So, Jane needs 9 points on her third test to pass."
"So, let's figure this out. We know that 3 people were kicked out of Walmart for not wearing masks. Then, 4 times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. That's 4 * 3 - 5 = 7 people. 

Next, 3 times the number of people kicked out for shoplifting were kicked out for physical violence. That's 3 * 7 = 21 people.

Now, we know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of Walmart. We need to find out how many were kicked out for other reasons. Let's add up the people we already know about: 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. 

So, if 31 people were kicked out for those reasons, and 50 people were kicked out in total, then 50 - 31 = 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

The final answer is: 19"
"Let's figure this out. Erin has 14 points now. Sara has 8 points. We know that Erin has three times more points than Sara. 

If Erin has three times more points than Sara, that means Erin has 3 * 8 = 24 points now. But we know Erin only has 14 points now. So, we need to find out how many points Erin had before.

Let's think about it. If Erin has 14 points now and she has 24 points in total, that means she had 24 - 14 = 10 points before. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to add up the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's find the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors and each picture frame costs $20. So, 44 x 20 = 880.

Next, we need to add the cost of etching the picture frames. The etching costs 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is 20% of $20. To find 20% of $20, we multiply 20 by 0.2 (since 20% is the same as 0.2). So, 20 x 0.2 = 4. Now, we multiply the cost of etching per frame by the number of frames, which is 44. So, 4 x 44 = 176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching. 880 + 176 = 1056.

Next, we need to find the cost of the pins. There are 2 seniors who will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, 2 x 5 = 10.

Now, let's find the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, and there are 44 seniors. So, 1/4 of 44 is 11. Each cord costs $12, so 11 x 12 = 132.

Finally, let's add up the cost of all the gifts. 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to know how much money Ethan saved by making it himself. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. If making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 

20% of $400 is the same as 0.2 x $400, which is $80. 

So, Ethan saved $80 by making the wallpaper himself. 

To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to subtract the amount he saved from the original cost. 

$400 - $80 = $320

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"Let's figure out how many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double that number of shoes, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

But, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 6 pairs from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 
14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:
50 * 2 = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many hours Hallie had dance practice per week, we need to add up the hours from each day. 

On Tuesdays, Hallie had 1 hour of dance practice.
On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of dance practice.
On Saturdays, she had twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours: 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"So, let's say a company bought some equipment for $400,000. But, some of the equipment was broken, which is 40% of the total amount. 

To find 40% of $400,000, we multiply 0.4 by $400,000. That's 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000. This is the value of the broken equipment.

Now, we need to find the value of the good equipment. To do that, we subtract the value of the broken equipment from the total amount. So, $400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

The final answer is: $240,000"
"Let's figure this out. Mary has 30 sheep. She gets milk from half of them and the other half. Half of 30 is 15. So, she gets milk from 15 sheep and 15 other sheep.

For the 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk each day. That's 15 x 1 = 15 kg of milk.

For the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk each day. That's 15 x 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, let's add the milk from both groups together. 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's figure this out. Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. She fed 6 of her children, so she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Now, she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces. To find out how many pieces she had, we multiply the number of rolls left by the number of pieces per roll. So, 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's figure this out. There are 40 pupils in the class. Half of them like blue, so that's 20 pupils. Now, we have 40 - 20 = 20 pupils left.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. To find one-fourth of 20, we can divide 20 by 4. 20 / 4 = 5. So, 5 pupils like green.

Now, we need to find out how many pupils like yellow. We already know that 20 pupils like blue and 5 pupils like green. So, the number of pupils who like yellow is 40 - (20 + 5).

First, let's add 20 and 5. 20 + 5 = 25. Now, we subtract 25 from 40. 40 - 25 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's figure out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56. Since she sells each apple for $4, we can find out how many apples she picked on Monday by dividing $56 by $4.

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Double of 12 is 2 x 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add up the number of apples Lucy picked each day to find the total:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's figure out how many socks Lindsay has missed. First, we need to know how many socks she washed. She washed 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair has 2 socks, she washed 10 x 2 = 20 socks from the pairs.

Then, she washed 15 loose socks. So, in total, she washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, we need to find out how many socks she missed. There were 50 socks to wash in the first place. To find out how many she missed, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks. 

50 - 35 = 15

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Let's figure out how many cookies are left for Rachel. 

First, we need to know how many cookies Rachel had in total. She bought 23 cookies and Janet gave her 42 cookies. To find the total number of cookies, we add 23 and 42.

23 + 42 = 65

Now, we know Rachel had 65 cookies. But then her brother ate 44 of them. To find out how many cookies are left, we need to subtract 44 from 65.

65 - 44 = 21

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay each month, we need to know the total amount she has to pay back, including the interest. 

First, we need to find the interest. The interest is 10% of the $3,650 she borrowed. To find 10% of a number, we multiply it by 0.10. 

$3,650 * 0.10 = $365

This is the interest she has to pay. Now, we need to add this to the amount she borrowed to find the total amount she has to pay back.
$3,650 + $365 = $4,015

Since she has to pay this amount in 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5 to find out how much she has to pay each month.
$4,015 / 5 = $801.00

The final answer is: $801"
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers.

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we need to multiply Chloe's speed by the time. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so Chloe hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe. To do this, we need to subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance. Cho hiked 112 kilometers and Chloe hiked 45 kilometers, so Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers farther.

"Let's figure out how many pesos Axel and Anna have together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

To find the total number of pesos they have together, we add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos. 
150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's figure out how much profit Millie will make per hour running her lemonade stand.

First, we need to know how much lemonade she can make. She bought supplies to make 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. So, she can make 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup for $1, so she will make 36 x $1 = $36 from selling all the lemonade.

The cost of the supplies is $18. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total money she makes: $36 - $18 = $18.

Now, we need to know how many hours she will sell the lemonade. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Since she has 36 cups, she will sell all of them in 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. This means he has 2/5 of his land left. We can set up an equation to find out how much land he had at first.

Let's call the total amount of land he had ""x"". Since he has 2/5 of his land left, we can write the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To find x, we need to get rid of the 2/5. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5/2.

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"So, there's a choir with 52 members, and half of them are boys and half are girls. That means there are 26 boys and 26 girls.

Now, the choir decides to perform with just the girls. But, on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Half of 26 is 13, so 13 girls can't make it.

The choir still needs to perform, so the 3 teachers decide to join in. To find out how many people are performing, we need to add the number of girls who made it to the number of teachers. That's 26 - 13 = 13 girls, and 3 teachers. So, 13 + 3 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find Wilson's math grade, we need to add up all his test scores and then divide by the number of tests. 

First, let's add up his scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Now, we divide the sum by the number of tests:
400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

"So, James has to deliver messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu. He delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. To find out how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu, we need to figure out 1/3 of 66.

To do that, we can multiply 66 by 1/3. Multiplying by a fraction is the same as dividing by its reciprocal. So, we can divide 66 by 3 to find 1/3 of 66.

66 ÷ 3 = 22

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu. Now, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

66 + 22 = 88

"Let's figure out how much money David saves.

First, we need to know how much it costs to ride each ride. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket is $2. So, the cost of one ride is 2 x $2 = $4.

Now, Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides. To find out how much she spends, we multiply the cost of one ride by 9. That's 9 x $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which lets him ride 9 rides. Since he doesn't need to buy any tickets, he only spends $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost of his ride bracelet from the cost of Dasha's tickets. That's $36 - $30 = $6.

So, David saves $6.

The final answer is: $6"

To find out how much ribbon she can use for each gift, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts. 

144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"Let's say Betty and Sam have a certain number of popsicles in a ratio of 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. To find out how many popsicles they have in total, we add the numbers in the ratio: 5 + 6 = 11.

Now, we know they have a total of 165 popsicles together. To find out how many popsicles each person has, we need to divide 165 by 11 (the sum of the ratio parts). 

165 ÷ 11 = 15. So, each part of the ratio is equal to 15. Now, we multiply the number of parts each person has by 15 to find out how many popsicles they have. Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, Tim wants to know how much money he'll save by canceling his cable subscription and getting streaming services instead. He gets Netflix for $10 a month. Then he gets Hulu and Disney Plus, which normally cost $10 each. But, if he gets both of them, he gets a 20% discount.

First, let's find out how much he'll pay for Hulu and Disney Plus together. That's $10 + $10 = $20. Now, we need to find 20% of $20. To do that, we multiply $20 by 0.2. That's $20 * 0.2 = $4. 

So, he gets a discount of $4. Now, we subtract that from $20 to get the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. That's $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, we add the cost of Netflix to that. $10 + $16 = $26. So, Tim will pay $26 a month for the streaming services.

To find out how much he'll save, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable subscription. That's $60 - $26 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out what percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to know how much time she spent on each part of making the song.

She spent 4 hours writing the song. Then she spent half that time recording it, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours. 

We need to convert the time she spent editing from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Now we add up all the time she spent: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we divide the time she spent editing (1.5 hours) by the total time (7.5 hours) and multiply by 100.

(1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

"Let's figure out how many Valentine's cards Erica has now.

First, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out. Then, her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each. So, she got 2 x 15 = 30 cards from her dad.

Now, Erica has 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

Next, Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. So, she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

After giving away 29 cards, Erica had 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

Finally, Erica received 17 cards from family and friends. So, she now has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices of pizza are left, we need to figure out how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since there are 12 slices, we can find 1/3 of 12 by multiplying 12 by 1 and then dividing by 3. That's 12 * 1 = 12, and then 12 / 3 = 4. So, Jenny gave 4 slices to Bill.

Jenny also gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. To find 1/4 of 12, we multiply 12 by 1 and then divide by 4. That's 12 * 1 = 12, and then 12 / 4 = 3. So, Jenny gave 3 slices to Mark.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so she gave away and ate a total of 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the total number of slices. That's 12 - 9 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"

Mark has $50 in his bank account and he earns $10 per day at his work. The bike he wants costs $300. To find out how many days he needs to save, we need to divide the cost of the bike by how much he earns per day.

Cost of the bike: $300
Amount earned per day: $10

Number of days = Cost of the bike / Amount earned per day
= $300 / $10
= 30

So, Mark has to save his money for 30 days to buy the bike."
"Let's figure out how many bugs Nancy found in her woodshed.

First, we know she saw 90 spiders. Then, she saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. To find out how many millipedes she saw, we need to divide 90 by 3. 

90 ÷ 3 = 30

So, she saw 30 millipedes. Now, let's find out how many stink bugs she saw. We know she saw twice as many millipedes as stink bugs, minus 12. To find out how many stink bugs she saw, we need to multiply 30 by 2 and then subtract 12.

2 x 30 = 60
60 - 12 = 48

So, she saw 48 stink bugs. Now, let's add up all the bugs she saw: 90 spiders, 30 millipedes, and 48 stink bugs.

90 + 30 + 48 = 168

"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we need to divide the total amount of flour required by the amount of flour in each bag. 

Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, and the normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour. So, he needs 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 cups.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so we need to divide 12 cups by 2 cups to find out how many bags Mark needs. 12 / 2 = 6.

Now, let's do the same thing for the milk. Mark needs 4 times the amount of milk in the normal recipe, which is 4 * 1 = 4 cups.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so we need to divide 4 cups by 2 cups to find out how many bottles Mark needs. 4 / 2 = 2.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk. Mark needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk, so the difference is 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's figure out how much energy Mel will save by using his air conditioner less.

Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. That's 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (or 7.2 kilowatt-hours) of energy per day.

If he uses it for 3 hours a day instead, that's 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (or 2.7 kilowatt-hours) of energy per day.

To find out how much energy he saves per day, we subtract the new energy used from the old energy used: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

Now, let's multiply the energy saved per day by 30 to find out how much energy he'll save in 30 days: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to know how many stripes all the zebras have and how many zebras there are.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There is one zebra with 36 stripes.
There is another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
There are 4 zebras in total.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game, we need to figure out how much money Tyson will spend on meat and cheese. 

First, we need to know how many sandwiches he needs to make. There are 20 people watching the game, and each sandwich serves 4 people. 

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So, Tyson needs 5 pounds of each.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds will be 5 * $7.00 = $35.00.

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds will be 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cheese: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

Allan has 40 cannolis in his house. We know that he has twice as many corns as cannolis. So, to find the number of corns, we multiply the number of cannolis by 2. 

40 * 2 = 80

So, Allan has 80 corns.

Now, Allan goes to the store and buys 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. He bought 60 cannolis, so he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, let's add the number of corns and cannolis Allan had initially to the number of corns and cannolis he bought:

Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 20
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200."
"Let's figure out how many steps Elliott took during his jog. 

Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps a day. He walked half of those steps to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

Then, he walked 1,000 more steps with his friend. So, before his jog, he had walked 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Now, we know that after his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to walk. To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to subtract the steps he had left from the total steps he had left to walk.

Elliott had 4,000 steps left to walk (10,000 - 6,000). But he only had 2,000 steps left after his jog. So, we subtract 2,000 from 4,000 to find out how many steps he took during his jog.

4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000

The final answer is: 2000"
"Let's figure out how early Toby will be at the airport.

First, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute. To find out how long it will take him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate: 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. So, if Toby starts reading the book and finishes it in 30 minutes, he will arrive at the airport in 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes. To find out how early he will be, we subtract the time he arrives from the time he has to be there: 60 - 40 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's figure out how much money the delivery service company paid to the employees in May and June.

First, we need to find out how much each employee made in May. There were 40 employees, and each one worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks. That's 160 hours per employee. If they get paid $15 per hour, then each employee made 160 * $15 = $2400 in May.

Now, let's multiply the amount each employee made by the number of employees to find the total amount paid in May. 40 employees * $2400 = $96,000.

Next, we need to find out how many employees were left in June. 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 is 10. So, 10 employees left, and 40 - 10 = 30 employees were left.

Each employee worked 160 hours in June, and they get paid $15 per hour, so each employee made $2400 in June. Now, let's multiply the amount each employee made by the number of employees to find the total amount paid in June. 30 employees * $2400 = $72,000.

Finally, we add the total amount paid in May and June to find the total amount paid in both months. $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

$168,000"
"Let's figure out how much money Sally has left.

First, we need to find out how much the taffy costs. The sale says that if you buy 1 pound of taffy for $3, you get the next pound for half off. So, the second pound of taffy costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we need to find out how much the seashells and magnets cost. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, we add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so we need to subtract the cost of the items from the $10 to find out how much she has left: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"So, Tim bought two packages of fireworks. One package costs $400 and the other costs twice as much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Then, Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find 20% of $1200, we multiply $1200 by 0.2, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Tim also bought a finale firework for $150.

So, the total amount Tim spent is $960 (fireworks) + $150 (finale firework) = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To figure out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to know how many cookies she eats in 30 days and how many cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. If she eats 2 cookies a night for 30 nights, she will eat a total of 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, which is 12 cookies. To find out how many dozens of cookies she needs, we divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many candles smell like wet dog and explode, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find out how many candles smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog. To find 5% of 50,000, we multiply 50,000 by 0.05. 

50,000 * 0.05 = 2,500 candles smell like wet dog.

Now, we need to find out how many candles are more likely to explode. Since Marcy says her candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, that means 1% of the candles can explode. To find 1% of 50,000, we multiply 50,000 by 0.01.

50,000 * 0.01 = 500 candles can explode.

But we need to find out how many of those 500 candles that can explode also smell like wet dog. We already know that 5% of the candles that can explode smell like wet dog. To find 5% of 500, we multiply 500 by 0.05.

500 * 0.05 = 25 candles smell like wet dog and can explode.

The answer is 25."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's figure out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathered 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees as she did from the tallest trees. That's 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathered 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

We don't know how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, so let's call that number 'x'. We do know that Joanne gathered a total of 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) apples.

Her sister gathered a total of 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105 apples.

The sisters gathered a total of 500 apples together. So, we can write an equation: 30 + 15 + x + 105 = 500.

Let's solve for x:
30 + 15 + x + 105 = 500
150 + x = 500
x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's solve the problem. We have a herd with camels and dromedaries. Camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump. We know there are 180 heads and 304 bumps in total.

Let's say there are C camels and D dromedaries. Since there are 180 heads, we can write an equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write another equation:

2C + D = 304

Now, let's solve for C and D. We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to get:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"Let's break down Tom's trip into parts. 

First, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days. That's a total of:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Then, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 km is:
(30/100) * 800 km = 240 km
So, he traveled 240 km in the next 2 days.

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so that's 0 km.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. That's a total of:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up all the distances:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"Let's figure this out step by step. We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, that means Zack's locker is 4 times as big as Peter's locker. 

To find out how big Zack's locker is, we multiply 5 cubic inches by 4. 
5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches (Zack's locker size)

Now, we know Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, Timothy's locker must be twice as big as Zack's locker. 

To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we multiply 20 cubic inches by 2. 
20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches (Timothy's locker size)

"Let's figure this out. Stanley was standing on a mountain at 10,000 feet. Then, his comb fell 4,000 feet to a ledge. To find where the comb is, we need to subtract 4,000 from 10,000.

10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000

So, the comb is at 6,000 feet. Now, we need to find out how many feet Oliver has to climb to get to the comb. Oliver is at 3,000 feet. To do this, we subtract 3,000 from 6,000.

6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000

So, Oliver has to climb 3,000 feet to get to the comb.

"Let's figure out how much money Mr. Josue has now.

First, Mr. Josue had $5000. Then, the first bank gave him $4000. So, he now has $5000 + $4000 = $9000.

Next, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000. Now, he has $9000 + $8000 = $17000.

So, Mr. Josue now has a total of $17000.

"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, there were 50 cats on the rock. Then, 4 boats came and took away 5 cats each. That's a total of 4 x 5 = 20 cats gone. 

Now, we need to subtract those 20 cats from the original 50. 50 - 20 = 30 cats left on the rock.

But then, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many cats that is, we need to multiply 3/5 by 30. To multiply a fraction by a number, we multiply the numerator (3) by the number (30) and then divide by the denominator (5). So, (3 x 30) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

Now, we need to subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the 30 cats left on the rock. 30 - 18 = 12.

"So, Bill signed up for a new streaming service. He got a good deal at first where it cost $8 a month for 6 months. Then it went up to $12 a month for 8 months. After that, it went up to $14 a month. We need to find out how much it cost him for 2 years.

First, let's find out how much it cost for the first 6 months. That's 6 months times $8, which is $48.

Next, we need to find out how much it cost for the next 8 months. That's 8 months times $12, which is $96.

Now, we need to find out how many months are left in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 2 years is 24 months. We already used 6 + 8 = 14 months, so we have 24 - 14 = 10 months left. For those 10 months, it cost $14 a month, so that's 10 times $14, which is $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period. $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's figure out how much more the jogger jeans cost than the tattered jeans.

First, we know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. If we call the cost of the tattered jeans ""T"", then the jogger jeans cost T - 6.

We also know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and 2/3 from the tattered jeans. This means that 1/3 of the jogger jeans' cost minus 6 is equal to 2/3 of the tattered jeans' cost. We can write this as:

(1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6

To make it easier to solve, let's multiply both sides by 3:

T - 6 + 2T = 18

Now, let's combine like terms:

3T - 6 = 18

Add 6 to both sides:

3T = 24

Now, let's divide both sides by 3:

T = 8

So, the tattered jeans cost $8. Now that we know the tattered jeans cost $8, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans by subtracting 6:

J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2

The jogger jeans cost $2 less than the tattered jeans, but we want to know how much more the jogger jeans cost. Since the jogger jeans cost $2 less, that means the jogger jeans cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"So, let's figure out how many employees can go on the day trip. We have 4 big buses that can hold 60 people each. That's 4 x 60 = 240 people.

We also have 6 smaller buses called minibusses that can hold 30 people each. That's 6 x 30 = 180 people.

And we have 10 minivans that can hold 15 people each. That's 10 x 15 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up all the people: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 people.

"Lillian wants to add some bird feeders to her garden. She makes 3 and buys 3 more. The homemade bird feeders attract 30 birds each, and the store-bought ones attract 20 birds each. 

To find the total number of birds, we need to add the number of birds that come to the homemade feeders and the number of birds that come to the store-bought feeders.

The homemade feeders attract 3 * 30 = 90 birds. The store-bought feeders attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

So, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 90 + 60 = 150.

"So, Aleksandra went to a restaurant and ordered some food. The bagel cost $4. The soup was 25% more than the bagel, which means it was 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5. 

The cake was half the price of the bagel, so it was 4 / 2 = $2.

To find the total cost, we add the prices of all the items together: 4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to figure out how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he needs to make $50 from selling the cards. 

Each card is sold for $1.5, so we can find the number of cards he sold by dividing $50 by $1.5.

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5 = 33.33

Since you can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to 33 cards.

Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards x. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"So, let's figure this out. The caterer was supposed to make hotdogs for 36 guests. But, he made enough for half of them to have two hotdogs each. That's 18 guests with two hotdogs. So, he made 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for those 18 guests.

And then, he made enough for the other half of the guests (also 18) to have one hotdog each. That's 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for those 18 guests.

So, in total, he made 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

But, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. That means he needed 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since he only had 54 hotdogs, that means 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. This means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 26"

"Let's figure out how much Charlotte's order cost. 

First, we need to add up the cost of all the things she bought. 

- A set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- A set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so that's 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

But, the clerk told Charlotte that everything was 20% off. To find 20% of $165.00, we multiply $165.00 by 0.20. That's 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost. So, $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to know how much money she has and how much the things she wants cost.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost of the items is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mom, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's figure out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Since Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we need to find three quarters of 100. To do that, we multiply 100 by 3 and then divide by 4. 

100 * 3 = 300
300 / 4 = 75

So, Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.

Now, Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. We multiply 75 by 2 to find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew.

75 * 2 = 150

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we multiply 150 by 1 and then divide by 5.

150 * 1 = 150
150 / 5 = 30

So, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to know how much gas was in one container. We have 15 gallons of gas that are equally divided into 5 containers. 

To find out how much gas is in one container, we divide 15 by 5. 

15 ÷ 5 = 3 gallons

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. 

So, we multiply 3 gallons by 8 pints.

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container. To find out how many pints that is, we multiply 3 gallons by 1/4.

3 * 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

Now, we convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 0.75 by 8.

0.75 * 8 = 6 pints

"Let's figure out how many candy bars George bought.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his money. If 1% is $0.01, then 99% is $4.99.

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each. That's 3 x 40 cents = $1.20.

Now, let's find out how much money George spent on candy bars. He spent $4.99 - $1.20 = $3.79 on candy bars.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to divide $3.79 by 0.75.

$3.79 ÷ 0.75 = 5.0533

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"

"Let's figure out how much cake is left. First, we need to know how much cake Rory and her mom ate. The cake is cut into 8 pieces, and they each ate one. So, together they ate 2 pieces.

To find out how much cake they ate, we need to know how much cake is in each piece. Since the cake is cut into 8 equal pieces, we can divide the total weight of the cake by 8.

Total weight of cake = 20 ounces
Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Now, we know that Rory and her mom each ate 2.5 ounces of cake. So, together they ate 5 ounces of cake.

To find out how much cake is left, we need to subtract the amount they ate from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

"Let's figure out how many oranges everyone will get. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. To find the total number of oranges, we add them together: 34 + 22 = 56.

Now, they want to share these oranges with their 6 friends. That's a total of 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends). To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the cost per serving of Antoine's french onion soup, we need to know how much everything costs and how many people it serves.

First, let's figure out how much the onions cost. Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he wants to double that, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. Onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the onions will cost 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we need to find out how much the beef stock costs. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock together to get the total cost. $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of people it serves. $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know that Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater. Now, Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's. So, we multiply 4 minutes by 4 to find out how long Bernadette's drive takes. 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. That means she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 - 5 = -1 minutes before Wayne. But, we can't leave before we start, so we need to find out how long before Wayne arrives that Bernadette needs to leave.

Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, and she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we need to know the length and width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, 3 yards is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
To find the width, we need to divide 360 by 9.
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"Let's figure out how many more beads one sister has than the other.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Each pack has 20 beads. So, Elizabeth has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Each pack has 20 beads. So, Margareth has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's figure out the final temperature of Marcus's house.

First, Marcus bakes for 3 hours. Every hour, the oven makes the house 5 degrees warmer. So, we need to multiply 3 hours by 5 degrees. That's 3 x 5 = 15 degrees warmer.

Now, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is 3 groups of 10 minutes, the house cools down 2 x 3 = 6 degrees.

The house starts at 40 degrees. It gets 15 degrees warmer and then 6 degrees cooler. So, we add 15 and then subtract 6. That's 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"Let's figure out how long it took James to run in the triathlon. 

First, we need to find out how long it took James to do the whole triathlon. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, and it took him 170 minutes to finish. So, it took James 170 + 10 = 180 minutes to finish.

Next, let's find out how long it took James to swim and bike. We know that James swims 10% faster than Jon. 10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes, so James swims 40 - 4 = 36 minutes. James bikes 5 minutes longer than Jon, so he bikes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to run. We know it took him 180 minutes to finish the whole triathlon, and it took him 36 minutes to swim and 85 minutes to bike. So, it took him 180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = 59 minutes to run.

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to figure out how long it is. We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours. To change hours to minutes, we multiply by 60. So, 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 to 75, which is 80 minutes.

Finally, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find one-fourth of 80, we divide 80 by 4. 80 / 4 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, Michael is racing his horse. For every mile the horse runs, it eats half a bail of hay. A bail of hay costs $3. Michael's horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. We need to figure out how much hay the horse eats and how much money Michael has left after buying the hay.

First, we need to convert 30 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we need to find out how far the horse ran. We know the horse ran for 0.5 hours at 32 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats half a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we need to know how many eggs she has and how many eggs are needed for each glass of eggnog.

Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, which is 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. She also has 2 loose eggs, so she has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so we need to divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can make. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we need to divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's figure out how many points Joey is winning by. 

First, we need to find out how many points Joey has after his turn. We add the points he scored to the points he already had. Joey had 214 points and he scored 26 points, so we add 214 and 26.

214 + 26 = 240

Now, we need to find out how many points Marcy has after her turn. We add the points she scored to the points she already had. Marcy had 225 points and she scored 10 points, so we add 225 and 10.

225 + 10 = 235

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's points and Marcy's points to see how many points Joey is winning by. We subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points.

240 - 235 = 5

So, Joey is winning by 5 points."
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to know how much money he made from selling the sneakers and how much he spent to buy them.

First, let's find out how much money he made from selling the sneakers. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday, so he made:
17 x $20 = $340

Then, he sold the rest of the sneakers to a department store for $25 each. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left. So, he made:
31 x $25 = $775

Now, we add the money he made from both sales:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The salesman spent $576 to buy the sneakers. To find his profit, we subtract the cost from the total money he made:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of crayons, we need to calculate the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each and the four packets with 16 pieces each.

First, let's find the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each. We multiply 6 (the number of packets) by 8 (the number of crayons in each packet): 6 * 8 = 48

Next, we find the total number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each. We multiply 4 (the number of packets) by 16 (the number of crayons in each packet): 4 * 16 = 64

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

If you buy a super ticket for $20, it includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra. This means the super ticket costs $20 - $1 = $19 for the movie ticket and the extras.

If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $12 + $3 = $15. 

If you buy the super ticket and save $2, that means the super ticket costs $15 (the cost of the regular ticket and soda) + $2 = $17. But we know the super ticket costs $20, so the extra $3 is the cost of the popcorn.

Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much it costs to fill one balloon. We know that it costs $900 to fill 20 balloons. To find the cost of one balloon, we divide $900 by 20. 

$900 ÷ 20 = $45. 

This means it costs $45 to fill one balloon. 

Now, we know that the price of filling one balloon went up by $20. So, the new price of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65. 

We need to find out how much it costs to fill 170 balloons at the new price. To do this, we multiply the new price of one balloon by 170. 

$65 * 170 = $11,050.

The final answer is: $11,050"
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to know how far it traveled and how long it took. 

First, let's find out how far the car went. The car went 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, so it went 60 x 2 = 120 miles. Then, it went 30 miles per hour for 1 hour, so it went 30 x 1 = 30 miles. 

Now, we add those two distances together to get the total distance: 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

Next, we need to know how long the car took to travel that distance. It took 2 hours to go the first part and 1 hour to go the second part, so it took a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Now, we divide the total distance by the total time to get the average speed: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's figure out how much money Jenna's jewels are worth.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

Sapphires are worth $800 each, so 5 sapphires are worth 5 * $800 = $4000.

Rubies are worth $1200 each, so 2 rubies are worth 2 * $1200 = $2400.

To find the total value of her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies together: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"Let's figure out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. To find out how many apples they eat together, we need to add the number of apples they each eat. So, 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we need to multiply the number of apples they eat per day by the number of days. There are 30 days. So, we multiply 8 apples/day by 30 days.

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how much potting soil Bob needs, we have to figure out how much soil is in one bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

First, we need to find the volume of one bed. The bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find the volume, we multiply these numbers together: 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 beds, we multiply the volume of one bed by 10: 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Now, we need to know how many bags of potting soil Bob needs. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so we divide the total volume by 2: 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag: 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to find out how many green cards there are. We know there are 15 red cards, and there are 60% more green cards than red cards. 

60% of 15 is 9, so there are 9 more green cards than red cards. To find the total number of green cards, we add 9 to 15:
15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards. So, we add 15 and 24:
15 + 24 = 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:
15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"Let's figure out how many fairies are left.

Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest. Then, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. To find half of 50, we divide 50 by 2, which is 25. So, 25 more fairies joined the group.

Now, we add the 25 new fairies to the 50 fairies that were already there. 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

But then, 30 fairies flew away. To find out how many fairies are left, we subtract 30 from 75. 75 - 30 = 45.

So, there are 45 fairies remaining.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to know how many puppies in total and how many of them have spots. Jennifer has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. Brandon has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

First, let's add up all the puppies. Jennifer has 8, and Brandon has 12, so together they have 8 + 12 = 20 puppies.

Now, let's count the puppies with spots. Jennifer has 3, and Brandon has 4, so together they have 3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100. So, we do 7 ÷ 20 and then multiply by 100.

7 ÷ 20 = 0.35
0.35 * 100 = 35

So, 35% of the puppies have spots.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we need to know how much stuff he's buying and how much his truck can carry.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, which weigh 2 pounds. He also buys 4 bags of carrots, which weigh 48 pounds. Then, he buys 42 bales of hay, which weigh 3150 pounds, and 20 sacks of oats, which weigh 1300 pounds.

To find the total weight of all the feed, we add up the weight of each thing: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Now, we need to divide the total weight by how much the truck can carry, which is 2250 pounds. 

3400 / 2250 = 1.511

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's figure out how much money Grayson earns from recycling.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda and 5 plastic bottles of water every week. Aluminum cans are worth 2 cents each, and plastic bottles are worth 3 cents each.

First, let's find out how much money Grayson earns from the aluminum cans. She drinks 3 cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents.

Next, let's find out how much money Grayson earns from the plastic bottles. She drinks 5 bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents.

Now, let's add the money Grayson earns from the cans and bottles. 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents. This is how much Grayson earns every week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to multiply the weekly earnings by 4. 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

"Let's figure out how many students Miss Maria has. 

First, we need to find out how many cards she has in total. She has 6 decks of basketball cards, and each deck has 25 cards. So, we multiply 6 by 25 to get the total number of basketball cards: 6 x 25 = 150.

Next, we need to find out how many baseball cards she has. She has 5 boxes of baseball cards, and each box has 40 cards. So, we multiply 5 by 40 to get the total number of baseball cards: 5 x 40 = 200.

Now, we add the number of basketball cards and baseball cards together to get the total number of cards: 150 + 200 = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract 50 from 350 to find out how many cards she gives to her students: 350 - 50 = 300.

Since each student gets 10 cards, we divide 300 by 10 to find out how many students she has: 300 ÷ 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's figure out how much more Kelly paid than Becky.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. First, we need to find out how much she paid in total. We multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 900 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 900 cents / 100 = $9. But Becky got a $1 discount, so we need to subtract that from her total: $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. First, we need to find out how much she paid in total. We multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 1000 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 1000 cents / 100 = $10. But Kelly got a 10% discount, which is the same as 0.1. We multiply the total cost by 0.1 to find the discount: 0.1 * $10 = $1. Now we subtract the discount from Kelly's total: $10 - $1 = $9.

Now we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. We subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total: $9 - $8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"

"Let's figure out how many shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday.

First, we need to know how many shoes he has at the beginning. He has 200 shoes.

Then, on Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 x 2 = 10 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 x 2 = 30 shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 x 2 = 60 shoes.

So, the total number of shoes he has after getting new pairs is 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

But then, on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

To find out how many shoes he has left, we need to subtract 180 from 300. That's 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

"Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles. Each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. To find out how many cupcakes she can decorate, we multiply the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate.

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To do this, we divide 48 by 12.

48 ÷ 12 = 4

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes."
"To find out how much change Theo got, we need to know how much she spent and how much she gave the cashier. 

The pen cost $2. The paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6. So, the paper cost $6 - $1 = $5.

The total cost of the pen and the paper is $2 + $5 = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $10 she gave. $10 - $7 = $3.

So, the change Theo received is $3."
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many pencils were in the class at the beginning. There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils. So, we multiply 30 students by 10 pencils to get the total number of pencils.

30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

Now, we know that 1/5 of the pencils were used after two months. To find out how many pencils were used, we multiply 300 by 1/5.

1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils

So, 60 pencils were used. To find out how many pencils were left, we subtract 60 from 300.

300 - 60 = 240 pencils

Now, we know that at the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find out how many pencils were left, we multiply 240 by 1/3.

1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils

"Let's solve the problem. Matt's dad said he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we need to figure out how many carrot sticks he has to eat.

Let's call the number of carrot sticks 'x'. If Matt eats half as many cookies as carrot sticks, that's (1/2)x. And he gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies he gets is (1/2)x + 2.

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we can set up an equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to get rid of the 2 on the left side. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Now, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides by 2:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to know the length of the remoras in feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing 6 by 12.

6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

So, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's say there are x students in the grade level. If three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, that means one-fourth of the students don't have one. We know that 20 students don't have a desktop computer. Since one-fourth of the students don't have a desktop computer, we can say that 20 students is equal to one-fourth of the total number of students.

We can write this as an equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4. This will cancel out the 1/4 on the left side.

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students in the grade level."
"To find out how many days Jason has to walk in total, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). 

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we need to divide the total number of days by 4.

"Let's figure this out. Sarah spent $300 on books, and each book costs $15. To find out how many books she bought, we need to divide the total amount she spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Now, Sarah wants to give an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each kid gets, we need to divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's figure this out. We know that 9 kids in Gina's class are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. 

To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts, but then we have to subtract the kids allergic to both because they were counted twice. 

So, we add 9 and 6, which is 15. But then we subtract 3 because they were counted twice. 15 - 3 is 12. 

Now, we need to find out how many kids in the class aren't allergic to anything. We know there are 32 kids in the class, so we subtract 12 from 32. 

32 - 12 is 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"So, the company is taking its employees on a tour to an ancient site. They're dividing them into groups, and each group has 200 employees. There are 3 groups in total.

To find out how many employees are going on the tour, we multiply the number of groups by the number of employees in each group. That's 3 groups * 200 employees per group = 600 employees.

Now, each group also has 7 tour guides. Since there are 3 groups, we multiply the number of tour guides per group by the number of groups. That's 7 tour guides per group * 3 groups = 21 tour guides.

To find the total number of people going on the tour, we add the number of employees and the number of tour guides. That's 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people.

The final answer is: 621"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal. To find the new price, we need to multiply the normal price by 1.2. The normal price is $1500 per day, so the new price is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip. $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"Let's figure out how many tubes of paint Jasper has.

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben. Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper also has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has in total, we need to add the number of blue and yellow tubes. 2 + 9 = 11.

"Let's figure out the weight of the two pennies. We know that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. 

To find three-quarters of 48 grains, we multiply 48 by 3 and then divide by 4. 

48 * 3 = 144
144 / 4 = 36

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains. 

Now, we need to find the combined weight of the two pennies. We add the weight of the 1959 penny to the weight of the 2010 penny.

36 + 48 = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to add up how much money Keegan and Tasha have already earned. Keegan earned $83 and Tasha earned $91. 

$83 + $91 = $174

Now, we need to subtract this amount from their goal of $200 to find out how much more they need.

$200 - $174 = $26

So, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"Let's figure this out. Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has 3 x 20 = 60 songs.

Now, we need to find out how many more songs each of them can add to their players. Gabriel's player can hold 100 songs, and he already has 20, so he can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs.

Luri's player can also hold 100 songs, and he already has 60, so he can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we need to subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add. So, 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's figure out how much money Stetson gave up. 

They picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. To find out how many oranges he ate, we need to multiply 60 by 2/5. 

First, multiply 60 by 2: 60 * 2 = 120. 
Then, divide 120 by 5: 120 / 5 = 24. 

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Now, we need to find out how much money he gave up. He gave up $10 for each orange, so we multiply 24 by 10: 24 * 10 = 240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to multiply the cost of her shoes by 3. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to know how many miles he runs in a week and how fast he runs.

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. So, we multiply 12 miles by 5 days to get the total miles he runs in a week.

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Now, we know James runs 60 miles in a week and he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles by his speed.

60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

"Let's figure out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses.

First, we need to know how much oats each horse eats in a day. Since each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and he feeds them twice a day, that's 5 x 2 = 10 pounds of oats per horse per day.

Now, Uncle Ben has 4 horses, so we need to multiply the amount of oats each horse eats by the number of horses. That's 10 x 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day for all the horses.

Since Uncle Ben needs oats for 5 days, we multiply the daily amount by 5. That's 40 x 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

Each bag of oats has 50 pounds, so we need to divide the total amount of oats by 50 to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs. That's 200 ÷ 50 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many girl Pomeranians Jana has, we need to first figure out how many Pomeranians she has. Since two thirds of her puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this by multiplying 27 (the total number of puppies) by 2/3.

27 * 2/3 = 18

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. Now, we need to find out how many of these are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this by multiplying 18 by 1/3.

18 * 1/3 = 6

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add the temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48°F, in Northlandia is 21°F, and in Midlandia is -3°F.

First, let's add the temperatures: -48 + 21 = -27, then -27 - 3 = -30

Now, we divide the sum by 3: -30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to know how much money he still needs to save and how much he saves each day.

The toy car costs $12 and he already has $4, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to save.

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we know he saves $2 each day from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings.

Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

"Let's figure this out. Jaime has 2 trays that can hold 24 eggs each. So, we need to find out how many eggs can fit on both trays.

To do that, we multiply the number of eggs each tray can hold by the number of trays:
24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Now, we know Jaime has 64 eggs. We need to find out how many eggs won't fit on the trays. To do that, we subtract the number of eggs that can fit on the trays from the total number of eggs:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

So, 16 eggs won't fit on the trays.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much Sally spent, we need to know the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

The small pizza costs $8. To find the cost of the family-size pizza, we multiply 8 by 3.

8 * 3 = 24

So, the family-size pizza costs $24. Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

8 + 24 = 32

"Heather wants to buy 2 packs of razors. Each pack has 4 razors and costs $4.00. Right now, they're on sale where you buy one pack and get one free. She also has a $2.00 coupon.

First, we need to figure out how much Heather will pay for 2 packs of razors. Since it's buy one get one free, she only has to pay for 1 pack, which is $4.00. Then, she gets a $2.00 discount with her coupon. So, she'll pay $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00 for 2 packs of razors.

Now, we need to find out how many razors she'll get. Since each pack has 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find out how much each razor costs, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors. So, $2.00 ÷ 8 = $0.25. 

To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100. So, $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of all the levels.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"Let's figure this out. Charisma works 8 hours a day and she walks 5 minutes every hour. To find out how many minutes she walks in a day, we need to multiply the number of hours she works by the number of minutes she walks each hour.

8 hours * 5 minutes = 40 minutes

So, Charisma walks 40 minutes every day. Now, we need to find out how many minutes she walks in 5 days. We can do this by multiplying the number of minutes she walks in a day by the number of days she worked.

40 minutes * 5 days = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to find out how old Brett will be in four years. Since he's 14 now, we add 4 to 14, which is 18. 

Now, we know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, we multiply 14 by 3, which is 42. 

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is now, we need to subtract 4 from 42. 

42 - 4 = 38

So, Angela is 38 years old now."
"Let's figure out how much money Paul spent on driving his car. He drives twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. He did this for 14 days.

The morning rides cost $6 each, and the afternoon rides cost $2 each. To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of days by the cost of each ride.

For the morning rides, that's 14 days * $6 per day = $84.

For the afternoon rides, that's 14 days * $2 per day = $28.

Now, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides together. $84 + $28 = $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"Let's figure out how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box. That's 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Now, let's add the oranges they both have together: 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

To make one Greek orange pie, you need 3 oranges. So, to find out how many pies they can make, we need to divide the total number of oranges by 3.

120 ÷ 3 = 40

So, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"Let's say Mark is planning a surprise party for his wife and he's trying to decide between two different places to have it. One place charges a flat fee of $200, no matter how many people come. The other place charges $25 for each person who comes, but food is already included in the price.

If Mark has to pay for food at the first place, it will cost him $5 for each person who comes. So, the total cost for the first place is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost for x people).

The total cost for the second place is just $25x (since food is already included).

We want to find out how many people need to come so that both places cost the same. To do this, we can set up an equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

To solve for x, we need to get all the x terms on one side and the numbers on the other side. We can do this by subtracting 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Now, we need to get x by itself. To do this, we can divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, Mark needs 10 people to come for both places to cost the same.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that together they collected 43 insects. So, the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. 

We can write the equation as: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: x + x = 2x, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2: x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: x/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: x/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's figure out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether.

First, we need to find out how many yards Mariah used. She used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we can multiply 364 by 1/4 to find out how many yards Mariah used.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (the top number of the fraction) and then divide by the denominator (the bottom number of the fraction). So, we multiply 364 by 1 and then divide by 4.

364 ÷ 4 = 91

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Next, we need to find out how many yards her grandma used. She used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. We can multiply 364 by 1/2 to find out how many yards her grandma used.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (the top number of the fraction) and then divide by the denominator (the bottom number of the fraction). So, we multiply 364 by 1 and then divide by 2.

364 ÷ 2 = 182

So, her grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together to find the total yards of yarn they used.

91 + 182 = 273

The final answer is: 273"
"Let's figure out how many gifts Cherrie bought. 

First, we need to find out how many gifts Cherrie bought for her friends. 2 of her friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts. Then, 3 of her friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts. 

Now, we add the gifts for the 2 friends and the 3 friends together. 10 + 6 = 16 gifts. 

But that's not all! Cherrie also bought 10 more random gifts. So, we need to add those to the total. 16 + 10 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know the chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so we add 5 to 3 to find the rug's width. 
Rug's width = 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Now, we need to find the couch's length. It's 2 feet longer than twice the rug's width. Twice the rug's width is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 
So, the couch's length is 2 feet longer than that, which is 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's figure out how much each pack of strawberry gum costs.

Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. 2 of them are strawberry gum, 1 is grape gum that costs $2, and 1 is green apple gum that costs half as much as the grape gum. Since the green apple gum costs half as much as the grape gum, it costs $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. We can add up the cost of the grape gum and the green apple gum, which is $2 + $1 = $3. Now, we need to find out how much the 2 packs of strawberry gum cost in total.

Since the total cost is $7 and the grape and green apple gum cost $3, the strawberry gum must cost $7 - $3 = $4 in total.

Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, we can divide the total cost of the strawberry gum by 2 to find out how much each pack costs. $4 / 2 = $2.

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"Let's figure out how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make. He wants to buy wood to make the sticks, and he has $24 to spend. There are two types of wood he can buy: a 2 x 4 and a 2 x 8. A 2 x 4 costs $4 and gives 200 sticks, while a 2 x 8 costs $6 and gives 400 sticks.

To find out which wood gives the most sticks per dollar, we need to divide the number of sticks by the cost. For the 2 x 4, that's 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar. For the 2 x 8, that's 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar. Since 66.67 is more than 50, the 2 x 8 wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

Now, let's see how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24. We divide $24 by $6, which is 4. So, he can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to know how many snowshoes he needs. Since each dog has 4 legs and he has 6 dogs, we multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs each dog has. That's 6 * 4 = 24 legs.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of snowshoes. 24 / 2 = 12 snowshoes.

Now, we need to find the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"Let's figure out how much Janet saves by buying a weekly bus pass.

Janet takes the bus 5 days a week. Each bus trip costs $2.20. To find out how much she spends on bus trips in a week, we need to multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of trips she takes in a week.

Cost of one bus trip: $2.20
Number of trips in a week: 5

Total weekly cost of bus trips: $2.20 * 5 = $11.00

Now, let's see how much she would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20.

Weekly bus pass cost: $20
Weekly bus trip cost: $11.00

Amount saved: $20 - $11.00 = $9.00

So, Janet would save $9.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"Let's figure out how many animals the farm and the zoo have combined.

The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has 20 sheep. We also know that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. So, the zoo has 2 x 30 = 60 cows.

Now, let's think about the sheep. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm must have 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

To find the total number of animals at the farm, we add the cows and the sheep: 30 + 10 = 40 animals.

The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so we add those together: 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

Now, we add the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's solve the problem. 

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. We also know that she bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. 

Let's say Sophia bought 'x' onions and 'y' potatoes. Then, Rose bought 4x onions and 4y potatoes. 

Since we know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can write the equation as:
4x = 12
4y = 4

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:
x = 12 / 4
x = 3

To find the value of y, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:
y = 4 / 4
y = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we need to know how many days he has to lose the weight. We know his birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st. 

Let's count the days from December 31st to July 19th. December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. So, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5 calories per day.

The final answer is: 614"
"Let's figure out how much money Gerald has left.

Gerald works at a daycare and gets paid $30 every day. He worked for a whole week, which is 7 days. To find out how much he earned, we multiply the amount he gets paid per day by the number of days he worked:
$30/day * 7 days = $210

Now, we know Gerald earned $210. But he spent $100. To find out how much he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he earned:
$210 - $100 = $110

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we need to know how far she will run and how much water she needs to drink per kilometer. 

Her gym teacher tells her to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km. So, let's calculate the total distance she will run:
8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. To find out how much water she needs in total, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs per kilometer:
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's figure out how much money Julie has left.

First, Julie spent 20% of her $500 on clothes. To find 20% of $500, we multiply 0.2 by 500. That's 0.2 x 500 = 100 dollars. So, she spent $100 on clothes.

Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after buying clothes. We subtract the money she spent from the original amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs. To find 25% of $400, we multiply 0.25 by 400. That's 0.25 x 400 = 100 dollars. So, she spent $100 on CDs.

Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after buying CDs. We subtract the money she spent from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

So, Julie has $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's say the lot costs x dollars. The house costs three times as much as the lot, so it costs 3x dollars.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We can write an equation to represent this: x + 3x = 120,000

We can combine the x's: 4x = 120,000

Now, we need to find out what x is. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4

x = 30,000

So the lot costs $30,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the house costs 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"Let's figure out how much profit Tara made from selling her canvas bags.

First, we need to find out how much it cost her to buy the bags. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. To find the total number of bags, we multiply 8 packs by 5 bags per pack, which is 8 x 5 = 40 bags. Now, we multiply the total number of bags by the cost per bag, which is 40 bags x $4 = $160.

Next, we need to find out how much money she made from selling the bags. She sold each bag for $8. To find the total amount of money she made, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag, which is 40 bags x $8 = $320.

Now, we need to find the profit. Profit is the money you make after you subtract the cost from the money you made. So, we subtract the cost from the money she made: $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we need to know how long the fight lasted and how many punches he throws per minute. The fight was 5 rounds, and each round was 3 minutes long. So, we multiply 5 rounds by 3 minutes to get the total time: 5 x 3 = 15 minutes.

Now, we know Joe throws 25 punches per minute. To find the total number of punches, we multiply the total time by the number of punches he throws per minute: 15 x 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"Let's figure out how many cookies Kelsie made. We know Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made one-fourth of what Suzanne made, so we need to divide 36 by 4 to find out how many cookies Josh made. 

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So Josh made 9 cookies. Now, we know Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. First, we need to find out how much money he has in total. 

4 $10 bills = 4 x $10 = $40
6 $20 bills = 6 x $20 = $120
Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

Now, Ali gives his sister half of the total money. Half of $160 is $80. So, he gives his sister $80 and has $160 - $80 = $80 left.

Next, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of $80, we multiply $80 by 3 and then divide by 5. 

3/5 of $80 = ($80 x 3) / 5 = $240 / 5 = $48
So, Ali uses $48 to buy dinner. Now, we need to subtract $48 from the remaining money to find out how much he has left.

$80 - $48 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"Let's figure this out. We know that Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. First, we need to change 2 hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Double the time it takes Rob is 2 x 120 = 240 minutes. Then we add 40 minutes to that, so 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

The final answer is: 280"
"To find out how many skeins of wool Martha needs, we need to calculate how many she needs for each thing she's making. 

For the hats, she needs 2 skeins each, and she's making 3 hats. So, that's 2 x 3 = 6 skeins.

For the scarves, she needs 4 skeins each, and she's making 3 scarves. So, that's 4 x 3 = 12 skeins.

For the sweaters, she needs 12 skeins each, and she's making 3 sweaters. So, that's 12 x 3 = 36 skeins.

For the mittens, she needs 1 skein each, and she's making 3 pairs. So, that's 1 x 3 = 3 skeins.

For the socks, she needs 2 skeins each, and she's making 3 pairs. So, that's 2 x 3 = 6 skeins.

Now, let's add up all the skeins: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63 skeins.

"Let's figure out how many math problems Chris has left to do.

Chris has 100 math problems to do in total. On Monday, he did 12 problems. That leaves him with 100 - 12 = 88 problems.

On Tuesday, he did 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. So, he did 3 x 12 = 36 problems on Tuesday. Now, he has 88 - 36 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, he did one-quarter of the problems that were left. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13. So, he did 13 problems on Wednesday. Now, we need to subtract those from the 52 problems he had left. 52 - 13 = 39.

So, Chris has 39 math problems left to do on Thursday."
"Let's figure out how many quarts of strawberries Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky can pick per hour.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. 
Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 x 5 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up how many quarts each of them can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

"To find out how many loaves of bread are left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves baked.

First, let's find out how many loaves were sold. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. So, the total number of loaves sold is 93 + 39 = 132.

Now, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves baked. The bakery returned 6 loaves. So, we need to subtract 132 (loaves sold) and 6 (loaves returned) from 200 (total loaves baked).

200 - 132 - 6 = 62

The number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"Let's figure out how many rows of flowers Jackson can plant.

Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. He bought 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips.

To find out how many rows of red tulips he can plant, we need to divide the number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

36 (red tulips) ÷ 6 (tulips per row) = 6

To find out how many rows of blue tulips he can plant, we need to divide the number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

24 (blue tulips) ÷ 8 (tulips per row) = 3

So, Jackson can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

"Heather has a big bag of raisins that has 27 cups in it. She wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with the raisins. To make a batch of oatmeal cookies, she needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Since Heather wants to divide the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each one will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins. 

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. We subtract the raisins used for the other two things from the total: 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins.

To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the raisins left by the amount needed for each batch. We can do this by multiplying 18 by 4 (the reciprocal of 3/4). 18 * 4 = 72 / 3 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much more Ada will pay for her electric bill, we need to figure out how much she pays before and after she gets the new device.

First, let's find out how much she pays in a week before she gets the new device. We know she uses 12 kilowatts of electricity per hour and there are 7 hours in a day. So, she uses 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, she uses 84 * 7 = 588 kilowatts per week. If each kilowatt costs $1.50, then she pays 588 * $1.50 = $882 per week.

Now, let's find out how much she pays after she gets the new device. The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour, so now she uses 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Again, she uses 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per day. In a week, she uses 98 * 7 = 686 kilowatts. Since each kilowatt costs $1.50, she pays 686 * $1.50 = $1029 per week.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost before the new device from the cost after the new device: $1029 - $882 = $147.

The final answer is: $147"
"Let's say one person can paint half a house in 5 days. That means if we have 5 people, they can paint half a house in 1 day because 5 people can do the work 5 times faster than one person.

Since they can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days because 2 halves make a whole.

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's figure out how many sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna have.

We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she must have 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's count the total number of sofas and chairs. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.

Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: 172"
"Let's say Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for some money. In total, he paid $48. We want to know how many more CDs he could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

First, let's find out how much money he spent on the headphone set. We know he spent $48 in total and $4 on the CD, so he spent $48 - $4 = $44 on the headphone set.

Now, let's figure out how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. If one CD costs $4, then he could have bought $44 / $4 = 11 CDs with that money.

If he had spent all his money on CDs, he could have bought $48 / $4 = 12 CDs.

So, if he hadn't bought the headphone set, he could have bought 12 - 1 = 11 CDs. That means he could have bought 11 more CDs.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's figure out how many hours Josh spent working out. He worked out 4 hours a week for most of the time, but there were some weeks where he worked out more.

There are 8 weeks in total. Josh worked out 4 hours a week for 6 of those weeks. So, we multiply 6 weeks by 4 hours to get the total hours for those weeks: 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Then, there were 2 weeks where Josh worked out 5 hours. We multiply 2 weeks by 5 hours to get the total hours for those weeks: 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Lastly, there was 1 week where Josh worked out 6 hours. We multiply 1 week by 6 hours to get the total hours for that week: 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, we add up all the hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

There are 48 people on the bus at first. When the bus makes its first stop, 8 people get off. So, we need to subtract 8 from 48 to find out how many people are left on the bus. 

48 - 8 = 40

Now, 5 times as many people as got off (which is 8) get on the bus. So, we multiply 8 by 5 to find out how many people get on.

8 * 5 = 40

Now, we add the people who got on to the people who were already on the bus.

40 (already on) + 40 (got on) = 80

Now, the bus makes its second stop. 21 people get off. We need to subtract 21 from 80 to find out how many people are left on the bus.

80 - 21 = 59

Next, 3 times fewer people get on the bus. This means we need to find 3 times 21 (the number of people who got off), and then subtract that from 21.

21 * 3 = 63

But we need to subtract 63 from 21, not add it. So, we do 21 - 63, but that's not possible because you can't have a negative number of people. This means we actually need to add 63 to 21, because 3 times fewer people means 3 times 21 is the number of people who didn't get on, and we need to add that to 21 to find the number of people who did get on.

21 + 63 = 84

Now, we add the people who got on to the people who were already on the bus.

59 (already on) + 84 (got on) = 143

The final answer is: 143"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Jame will be 27 in 5 years. That means he's 27 - 5 = 22 years old now.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Let's find Jame's age in 8 years: 22 + 8 = 30 years.

Now, we need to find twice Jame's age in 8 years: 2 * 30 = 60 years.

So, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than 60 years in 8 years. That means Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, we need to find his current age. We subtract 8 from 55: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jame's age and his cousin's age. Jame is 22 years old, and his cousin is 47 years old. The difference is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's figure out how much one monitor costs. 

We know that Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. The computer cost $1,100. We also know that the printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, we need to find out how much the printer cost. Since the printer is $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
$1,100 - $400 = $700

Now, we know the computer and the printer together cost $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find out how much the 2 monitors cost, we subtract this amount from the total cost:
$2,400 - $1,800 = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:
$600 / 2 = $300

So, one monitor costs $300."
"There are 20 kids on a school trip. They were divided into two equal groups of boys and girls. The boys went on a scavenger hunt and found 60 seashells each. 

Since there are 10 boys, the total number of seashells they found is 10 x 60 = 600.

The girls found seashells that are 4 times the number of seashells the boys found, plus the same number of seashells the boys found. This means the girls found 4 x 60 + 60 = 240 + 60 = 300 more seashells than the boys.

So, the girls found a total of 600 + 300 = 900 seashells.

Since there are 10 girls, each girl found 900 / 10 = 90 seashells.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's figure out how many candies Nick has.

We know that George had some candies and then he ate 5. Now he has 3 candies left. So, before he ate 5 candies, he had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 x 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to find Alyana's age first. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, who is 10 years old. So, we subtract 4 from 10 to find Alyana's age.

Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we need to find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we add 2 to Alyana's age to get Anne's age.

Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's figure out the total thickness of the four books.

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 = 81
81 + 45 = 126
126 + 62 = 188

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"Let's figure out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. To find out how many vlogs she has made so far, we need to add those numbers together.

18 + 21 = 39
39 + 15 = 54

So, Emma has made 54 vlogs so far. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we need to subtract 54 from 72.

72 - 54 = 18

Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"So, my wife and I went out to dinner and the bill was $50. She wanted to split it evenly, but she also wanted me to pay an extra 20% as a tip. 

To find the extra tip, I need to multiply the bill by 20%. To do that, I'll multiply 50 by 0.20. 

50 * 0.20 = 10

So, the extra tip is $10. Now, I need to add that to the original bill to find the total amount I paid.

50 + 10 = 60

I ended up paying $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy got. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3. $18 ÷ 3 = $6. So, the eldest boy got $6.

Next, he added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

Then, he added another $10, so he had $11 + $10 = $21.

After that, he spent $8, so he had $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he had $13 * 3 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"Let's figure out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April.

We know Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April. Since April has 30 days, we can divide 1125 by 30 to find out how much he needs to save each day. But, we also know that he wants to save twice as much in the second half as he saves in the first half.

Let's say Elvis saves x dollars each day in the first half of April. Then, he will save 2x dollars each day in the second half. The total amount he saves in the first half is x * 15 (since there are 15 days in the first half of April). The total amount he saves in the second half is 2x * 15.

The total amount he saves in April is the sum of the amounts he saves in the first and second halves. So, we can write an equation: x * 15 + 2x * 15 = 1125.

Now, let's simplify the equation: 15x + 30x = 1125. Combine like terms: 45x = 1125. Now, divide both sides by 45: x = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since Elvis saves x dollars each day in the first half, he saves 25 dollars each day in the first half. And since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2x = 2 * 25 = 50 dollars each day in the second half.

The final answer is: $50"
"Let's figure out how much change Verna got back.

First, we need to find out how much money Verna spent on fruits. She bought 3 apples for $1.50 each, so that's 3 x $1.50 = $4.50. Then, she bought 5 oranges for $0.80 each, which is 5 x $0.80 = $4. And finally, she bought 6 peaches for $0.75 each, which is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add up the costs: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13. So, Verna spent a total of $13.

If Verna gave $20, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the amount she gave. $20 - $13 = $7.

So, Verna got $7 in change.

"Let's figure this out. Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and Jenny gets $0.5 for each task. They both finished 20 tasks.

To find out how much Jairus gets, we multiply 0.8 by 20. 
Jairus' total = 0.8 * 20 = $16

To find out how much Jenny gets, we multiply 0.5 by 20. 
Jenny's total = 0.5 * 20 = $10

Now, we need to find the difference between Jairus' total and Jenny's total. 
Difference = Jairus' total - Jenny's total = 16 - 10 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars. So, the sum of what Jeff and Brad get is 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Now, we need to find out what x is. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 100 / 5
x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x. We already know that x is 20, so:

Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"So, Jeff walks to work and back home every day. That's 3 miles there and 3 miles back, which is a total of 6 miles per day.

"To find out how many letters Elise has written, we need to break it down step by step.

First, Elise writes the alphabet twice. There are 26 letters in the alphabet, so that's 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Then, she re-writes everything she has already written. She has 52 letters from writing the alphabet twice and 13 letters from writing half the alphabet, so that's 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. So, the total number of letters she has written is 65 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: 130"
"So, let's say Ali starts by calling 3 families. Then, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families. That's 3 * 3 = 9 families. 

Now, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families. That's 9 * 3 = 27 families. 

Next, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families. That's 27 * 3 = 81 families. 

So, in the fourth round of calls, 81 families will be notified."
"Let's figure out Mark's initial weight. We know he lost 10 pounds every month for 3 months. To find out how much weight he lost in total, we multiply the weight he lost per month by the number of months:

10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we know Mark's final weight is 70 pounds. To find his initial weight, we need to add the weight he lost to his final weight:

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"Let's figure out how many toys Jonathan has. We know that James has 80 toys, and the bigger play set is five times larger than James's. To find out how many toys are in the bigger play set, we multiply 80 by 5.

80 * 5 = 400

So, the bigger play set has 400 toys. Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to add up the cost of each item first.

Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks at $1.50 each. So, 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.

He also wants to buy 2 pens at $0.25 each. So, 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.

Next, he wants to buy 1 calculator at $12 and 1 geometry set at $10. So, $12 + $10 = $22.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $22 = $30.

But, the shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. To find 10% of $30, we multiply $30 by 0.1. So, 0.1 * $30 = $3.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

The final answer is: $27"

Next, let's find the total cost of the potato fries: 10 x $0.30 = $3
Then, let's find the total cost of the fruit drinks: 5 x $2 = $10

Now, let's add all the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

"To find out how much money Antonella earned, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find out how much commission she gets for selling $1000 worth of goods. To do this, we multiply $1000 by 30% (which is the same as 0.3). 

$1000 * 0.3 = $300

Now, we need to find out how much commission she gets for selling the rest of the goods. She sold $2500 worth of goods, and we already know that $1000 of that is covered by the first commission. So, we subtract $1000 from $2500 to find out how much more she sold.

$2500 - $1000 = $1500

Now, we need to find out how much commission she gets for selling $1500 worth of goods. To do this, we multiply $1500 by 10% (which is the same as 0.1).

$1500 * 0.1 = $150

Now, we add the two commissions together to find out how much Antonella earned.

$300 + $150 = $450

The total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"To figure out how many water bottles Bill needs, we need to know how many he already has and how many he needs for his guests.

Bill has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

Now, we need to know how many bottles he needs for his guests. He has 70 guests, and he wants 2 bottles for each guest. So, he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles for his guests.

In total, Bill needs 140 bottles for his guests and 48 bottles he already has. That's 140 + 48 = 188 bottles.

Since Bill already has 48 bottles, he needs to buy 188 - 48 = 140 more bottles.

"To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day, we need to know how long it takes him to swim a mile on a hot day. 

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. 

Twice the time it takes to swim a mile on a cold day is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Then we add 2 minutes to that, so 32 + 2 = 34 minutes. This is how long it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. 

Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes
Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes

Now, we can find the difference in time between the two days.

Difference in time = Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day - Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day

"To find out how many degrees from the ground the sun will be, we need to know the initial angle of the pyramid and how much the sun moves.

The initial angle of the pyramid is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees every hour. It moves for 10 hours.

First, we need to find out how many degrees the sun moves in 10 hours. We can do this by multiplying the number of degrees the sun moves per hour (5) by the number of hours it moves (10).

5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Now, we add the initial angle of the pyramid (32 degrees) to the number of degrees the sun moves (50 degrees) to find the final angle from the ground to the sun.

32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

"To find out how many candles James needs, we need to know how many candles each son needs. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so he's 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Each son needs one candle per year, so the older son needs 12 candles and the younger son needs 8 candles. In total, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since candles come in packs of 5, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. We can do this by dividing the total number of candles by 5.

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to know how many pages she read in the first week and the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"Let's figure out how old Shiloh's nephew is today.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

In 7 years, Shiloh's nephew will be some number of years old. Let's call that number x. So, in 7 years, Shiloh's nephew will be x years old.

The problem says that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This means that 51 (Shiloh's age in 7 years) is equal to 3 times x (Shiloh's nephew's age in 7 years).

We can write this as an equation: 51 = 3x.

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3. This gives us 51 / 3 = x.

51 divided by 3 is 17. So, x = 17.

This means that in 7 years, Shiloh's nephew will be 17 years old. But we want to know how old he is today. Since we know that in 7 years he will be 17, we need to subtract 7 from 17 to find his current age.

17 - 7 = 10.

"Let's figure out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week.

First, we need to find out how many wooden action figures Peter bought. He spent $5 each day on wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday. That's 4 days. So, he spent a total of 4 x $5 = $20 on wooden action figures. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, he bought 20 / 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

Now, let's see how many plastic action figures he can buy. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left. He will buy plastic action figures for the rest of the week, which is 5 days. Each plastic action figure costs $2. So, he can buy 50 / 2 = 25 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures. So, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

The final answer is: 29"
"So Leah got a new kitten. She had to pay $200 to get it spayed. Then she had to get 3 vaccines for the kitten, and each one cost $20. That's a total of 3 * $20 = $60 for the vaccines.

The kitten also broke 4 vases, and each vase cost $12. So, the total cost for the vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases. So, we add $200 + $60 + $48.

$200 + $60 = $260
$260 + $48 = $308

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"Let's figure out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses they order per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses they order per month is 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Now, let's find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month. We subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses they order per month: 260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's figure out how much money Katina will have left in her savings account after 2 years.

First, we need to know how many months are in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 2 years have 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Now, we know Katina takes out $100 from her account every month. To find out how much she takes out in 24 months, we multiply 24 by $100. That's 24 x $100 = $2400.

Katina started with $3000 in her account. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the amount she took out ($2400) from the initial amount ($3000). That's $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her savings account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit of the food truck, we need to know how much they spend and how much they make.

First, let's find out how much they spend. They buy bread for $3.00 a loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. So, they spend $3.00 on bread.

Next, they spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches. Since they're selling 10 sandwiches, they need to buy 1 set of cheese and condiments, which costs $30.00.

Now, let's add the costs together: $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00. This is how much they spend.

Now, let's find out how much they make. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. So, they make 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"Kate has 3 boxes of crayons, and each box has 64 crayons. To find out how many crayons she has in total, we multiply 3 by 64. That's 3 x 64 = 192 crayons.

Now, Kate wants to make muffin crayons. She melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin crayon. To find out how many muffin crayons she can make, we divide 192 by 8. That's 192 ÷ 8 = 24 muffin crayons.

Kate can sell each muffin crayon for $1.50. To find out how much money she can make, we multiply 24 by $1.50. That's 24 x $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the area of the room and the cost of the materials and labor.

First, we need to find the area of the room. The room is 18 feet by 12 feet, so we multiply 18 by 12 to get the area. 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Now, let's find the cost of the new carpet. The carpet costs $12 per square foot, so we multiply 216 by $12 to get the total cost of the carpet. 216 * $12 = $2592.

Next, we need to find the cost of the padding. The padding costs $2 per square foot, so we multiply 216 by $2 to get the total cost of the padding. 216 * $2 = $432.

Then, we need to find the cost of removing the old carpet. The contractor charges $4 per square foot, so we multiply 216 by $4 to get the total cost of removing the old carpet. 216 * $4 = $864.

After that, we need to find the cost of installing the new carpet. The contractor charges $34 per square foot, so we multiply 216 by $34 to get the total cost of installing the new carpet. 216 * $34 = $7344.

Now, let's add up the cost of the materials. The carpet costs $2592, the padding costs $432, and the old carpet removal costs $864. So, $2592 + $432 + $864 = $3888.

Next, we add up the cost of the labor. The old carpet removal costs $864 and the new carpet installation costs $7344. So, $864 + $7344 = $8208.

Finally, we add up the cost of the materials and the labor to get the total cost. $3888 + $8208 = $12196.

The final answer is: $12196"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by the number of days.

First, let's count the total number of birds Mack saw:

- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Now, let's add up all the birds: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280

Mack saw birds for 7 days. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days: 280 ÷ 7 = 40

"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the steps given.

First, we start with 20. Then, we find half of 20, which is 10. 

Next, we add 20 and 10 together, which gives us 30. 

After that, we divide 30 by 5, which equals 6.

Finally, we multiply 6 by the result of 20 minus 12, which is 8. So, 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"Let's figure this out. The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does. To find out how many cards his brother has, we need to subtract 3 from 5. 

5 - 3 = 2

So, the brother has 2 cards. Now, we need to add the number of cards the boy and his brother have together. 

5 + 2 = 7

They have 7 cards together."
"So, Maggie's oven is broken. When she sets it to 450, it actually gets to 468. We need to figure out what temperature she should set it to if her recipe calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's find out how much the oven is off. To do that, we subtract the set temperature from the actual temperature: 468 - 450 = 18.

Now, we need to find out what percentage the oven is off by. To do that, we divide the difference (18) by the set temperature (450) and multiply by 100: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to find the actual temperature for the recipe that calls for 520 degrees. To do that, we add 4% of 520 to 520. First, we find 4% of 520: (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

Now, we add 20.8 to 520: 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

But, we can't set the oven to a fraction of a degree. So, we round to the nearest whole number. However, we're looking for the temperature she should set the oven to, not the actual temperature.

To find the temperature she should set the oven to, we subtract the percentage by which the oven is off from the actual temperature. But, we actually need to subtract the percentage of the difference from the set temperature. 

The percentage of the difference is 4% of 520: (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The temperature she should set the oven to is 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature she should set the oven to is 499.

The final answer is: 499"
"To find out how many minutes Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour to 60 minutes. Then we add 30 minutes to that, which gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We convert 2 hours to minutes by multiplying 2 by 60, which gives us 120 minutes. Then we add 5 minutes to that, which gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"So, Herb's house cost $76,000. Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's. To find 30% of $76,000, we multiply 0.3 by $76,000. That's 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800.

Now, we need to find out how much Juan's house cost. We do this by subtracting $22,800 from $76,000. That's $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

So, Juan's house cost $53,200. To find the total cost of both houses, we add $76,000 and $53,200 together. That's $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200"
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. So, her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Let's add up the cups Judy brought: 12 cups
Let's add up the dishes Judy brought: 24 dishes
Total Judy brought: 12 + 24 = 36

Now, let's add up the cups her friend brought: 40 cups
Let's add up the dishes her friend brought: 44 dishes
Total friend brought: 40 + 44 = 84

Now, let's add the total number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend: 
Total Judy brought: 36

"Let's figure out how much each pair of contacts will cost.

First, we need to know how many pairs of contacts Pete will use in total. Since 90 contacts last 45 days, and he uses 2 contacts per day, we can find the total number of pairs he uses in 2 boxes.

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day
2 contacts per day * 90 days = 180 contacts

Since there are 2 contacts in a pair, we can divide 180 by 2 to find the total number of pairs:
180 / 2 = 90 pairs

Now, let's find out how much 2 boxes of contacts will cost with a 10% discount. Each box costs $100, so 2 boxes will cost:
2 * $100 = $200
10% of $200 is $20, so we subtract that from $200:
$200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:
$180 / 90 pairs = $2 per pair

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's figure out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. That's a total of 3 hours. She gets paid $10 an hour, so she made 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. He gets paid $10 an hour, so he made 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"Hannah does aerobics for 2 hours and runs for 1 hour. We need to find out how many calories she burns in total.

Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour, so in 2 hours, she burns 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories per hour, so in 1 hour, she burns 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

To find the total calories burned, we add the calories from aerobics and running: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Now, we need to find out how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories. To find out how many 200-calorie units there are, we divide the total calories by 200: 1600 / 200 = 8.

Since each 200-calorie unit needs 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100: 8 * 100 = 800.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B. We know that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is 99% of B, or 0.99B. We also know that there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is 101% of B, or 1.01B.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500. 

Combine like terms: 3.01B = 4500

Now, divide both sides by 3.01: B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find the number of red jelly beans (0.99B) and the number of green jelly beans (1.01B):
0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"Let's say Martin eats Cheerios for breakfast every day. He loses 1.25 pounds per week. If he eats donuts for breakfast every day, he gains 1.75 pounds per week.

We want to know how much difference there is in his weight after 5 weeks. To find this out, we need to multiply the weight change per week by the number of weeks.

If Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week, after 5 weeks he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week, after 5 weeks he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two. To do this, we subtract the weight lost from the weight gained: 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"So Alex is planning an event and she wants to know how many seats she needs. She sends an email to 100 people and each of them says they'll bring 2 friends. That's 100 + 200 (2 friends for each of the 100 people) = 300 people.

Then, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they're bringing their spouses. That's 10 + 8 = 18 more people.

So, in total, Alex has 300 + 18 = 318 people coming. But we need to remember that Alex is coming too, so we add 1 more to the total. That makes 318 + 1 = 319 people.

"To find out how much protein John gets from eating mushrooms, we need to know how much protein is in the mushrooms he eats. 

First, we need to know how much protein is in a cup of mushrooms. A cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein. 

Now, we know John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we need to figure out what percentage of the mushrooms are protein. We can do this by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now that we know the percentage, we can multiply it by the weight of mushrooms John eats: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's solve the problem. 

If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write an equation to represent this situation. Let's say Jerry's current age is 'x'. Then, 5 years ago, he was 'x - 5' years old. Since he is twice as old now as he was 5 years ago, we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

To solve for 'x', we need to get rid of the parentheses. We can do this by distributing the 2 to both terms inside the parentheses:

x = 2x - 10

Now, we want to get 'x' by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 'x' from both sides of the equation:

x - x = 2x - x - 10
0 = x - 10

Now, we want to get rid of the '-10' on the right side of the equation. We can do this by adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

0 + 10 = x - 10 + 10
10 = x

So, Jerry is 10 years old now. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant costs $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which is an extra $500. He already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work.

First, we need to find out how much George needs to pay in total. We know that 2 implants cost $2000 each, so that's 2 x $2000 = $4000. Then, we add the extra $500 for the crown, so that's $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

Now, we need to subtract the $600 deposit he already paid. That's $4500 - $600 = $3900. This is how much George still needs to pay.

To find out how many hours he needs to work, we need to divide the amount he still owes ($3900) by how much he makes per hour ($15). That's $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's say the smallest angle in the triangle is x. 

One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's 2x. 
One angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Now, let's divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. Now, let's find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"Let's figure out how many gumballs Colby can buy. 

First, we need to find out how much money Colby has in total. We know he has 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies. 

8 quarters are worth 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes are worth 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels are worth 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies are worth 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = 345 cents / 5 cents

"So, Jamaal is at the gym and he's using an 8-pound weight. He decides to increase the weight by 50%. To do this, we need to find 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% is the same as 0.5, so we multiply 8 by 0.5 to get 4 pounds. 

Now, we add 4 pounds to 8 pounds to get the new weight. 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

But then, Jamaal decides the weight is too heavy, so he uses a weight that's 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds. To find this, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds. 

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

So, Jamaal is now using a 10-pound weight."
"Let's figure out how many games Steve has after 3 years.

Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts every year. That's a total of 10 games per year. 

In the first year, Steve also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 24 = 34 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 48 = 58 games in the third year.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve gets in 3 years: 22 + 34 + 58 = 114 games.

"To find out how long it would take for the plane to travel 2000 miles, we need to know its speed. We can find the speed by dividing the distance it traveled by the time it took.

Distance = 1200 miles
Time = 3 hours

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now that we know the speed, we can find the time it would take to travel 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

"Let's figure out how much chocolate Ruiz and Marissa can make together in 12 hours.

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we need to divide 120 by 2. That's 120 ÷ 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates in 1 hour.

Now, let's find out how much Marissa makes in 1 hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates as Ruiz makes in 1 hour. To find 3/4 of 60, we multiply 60 by 3 and then divide by 4. That's (60 * 3) ÷ 4 = 45 pounds of chocolates in 1 hour.

Now that we know how much each of them makes in 1 hour, let's find out how much they make together in 12 hours. Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates. Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

To find the total amount of chocolate they made together, we add 720 and 540. That's 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds of chocolates.

On Monday, Howard spent $8 at the arcade. On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16. On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

To find the total amount he spent, we add the money he spent on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's figure out how much money Patrick made from selling lemonade.

First, we need to find out how many cups of lemonade Patrick sold in the first four hours. He sold 15 cups per hour, and he did that for 4 hours. So, we multiply 15 cups/hour by 4 hours.

15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups

Now, we need to find out how much money he made from selling those 60 cups. Each cup costs $0.50, so we multiply 60 cups by $0.50.

60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

Next, we need to find out how many cups of lemonade Patrick sold in the next two hours. He sold 10 cups per hour, and he did that for 2 hours. So, we multiply 10 cups/hour by 2 hours.

10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups

Now, we need to find out how much money he made from selling those 20 cups. Each cup costs $0.60, so we multiply 20 cups by $0.60.

20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, we add the money Patrick made from the first four hours and the next two hours.

$30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"Let's figure this out. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, and his tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles. So, to find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the miles driven by the number of rotations per 2 miles.

First, we need to find out how many times the tires rotate in 1 mile. Since they rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we divide 725 by 2 to get the number of rotations per mile.

Rotations per mile = 725 / 2
Rotations per mile = 362.5

Now, we multiply the rotations per mile by the miles driven per month.

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 362.5 rotations/mile
Rotations per month = 145,000 rotations/month

Next, we need to find out how many months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. We know the tires can handle 10,440,000 rotations.

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 145,000
Months before replacement = 72

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 72 / 12
Years before replacement = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we need to know how many pumps are in the bottle. The directions say that 2 pumps will give you 120 washings. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, then the bottle has 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

Now, we need to find out how much the whole bottle costs. The bottle costs $24.00. To make it easier to work with, we can convert this to cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the bottle costs 24 * 100 = 2400 cents.

To find the cost of each pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Joe will have left after buying the outfit, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items. 

The shirt costs $25, and there's a 30% discount. To find the discount, we multiply the price of the shirt by 0.3 (which is the same as 30%): 
$25 * 0.3 = $7.5

Now, we subtract the discount from the price of the shirt to get the discounted price:
$25 - $7.5 = $17.5

The shorts cost $35. To find the total cost, we add the price of the shirt and the price of the shorts:
$17.5 + $35 = $52.5

Since Joe has $50, we subtract the total cost from the amount he has:
$50 - $52.5 = -$2.5

Joe doesn't have enough money to buy the outfit."
"To find out how much butter Juan needs, we need to know how many croissants he wants to make and how much butter is needed for each dozen croissants. 

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so he wants to make 4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants.

Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, we multiply 28 dozen by 12 to get the total number of croissants: 28 * 12 = 336 croissants.

Now, we need to know how much butter is needed for each dozen croissants. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen: 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to know how much it costs to repave his street and how much it costs to repave Monica's street.

First, we need to find the cost to repave Lewis' street. We know it costs $194 per meter and his street is 490 meters long. To find the total cost, we multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street.

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street: 194 * 490 = $95,060

Next, we need to find the cost to repave Monica's street. We know it costs $194 per meter and her street is 150 meters long. To find the total cost, we multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street.

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Monica's street: 150 meters

Cost to repave Monica's street: 194 * 150 = $29,100

Now, we need to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's. We do this by subtracting the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street.

$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"So, John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months of his research. But his research takes a lot longer than expected, 10 times as long. That's 10 * 5 = 50 months. 

So, the first 5 months cost $100,000. The rest of the months, 50 - 5 = 45 months, cost more. They cost 50% more than the first 5 months. 50% of $100,000 is $50,000, so the extra is $50,000. The cost for the rest of the months is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000.

To find the total cost for the rest of the months, we multiply $150,000 by 45. That's $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

So, the total cost of John's research is $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The final answer is: $6,850,000"
"So, the basketball team went to a steakhouse to eat dinner. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. The second player had beef tips, and there were 8 of them, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces of beef tips. The third player had a one-pound steak, and since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces of steak.

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat they ate: 6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to know how many posts each member makes in a day and how many days are in March.

Each member posts 3 posts per day. There are 1000 members in the group. So, the group makes 1000 * 3 = 3000 posts per day.

March has 31 days. To find the total number of posts in March, we multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March: 3000 * 31 = 93,000.

The final answer is: 93000"
"Let's figure out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week. That's 2 times a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does laundry 2 * 52 = 104 times in a year.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. So, in a year, he uses 20 * 104 = 2080 gallons of water.

A gallon of water costs $0.15. To find out how much Gary spends on water, we multiply the total gallons of water by the cost of a gallon. That's 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

The final answer is: $312"
"To find out how much Scarlett spent, we need to add up the cost of everything she bought.

First, let's start with the aquarium. It cost $10.00.

Next, she bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each. That's 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.

Then, she bought 3 pieces of coral for $2.00 each. That's 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.

After that, she bought 20 fish for $0.50 each. That's 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.

Finally, she bought fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week and add the growth.

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

At the end of the second week, it doubled in height, so it was 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.

At the end of the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it was 6 + 4 = 10 inches tall.

So, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's figure this out. Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour. He works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

Now, we need to know how long it will take him to sell 750kg of meat from the bull. To find this out, we divide the total weight of the bull's meat by the amount of meat Prince sells per day: 750 / 150 = 5.

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from the bull.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many students were in the school auditorium, we need to know how many seats are in the auditorium. There are 4 rows of seats, and each row has 18 seats. 

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Now, let's figure out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were taken by them. 

Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Now, we need to find out how many seats were left. 
Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the parents. One-third of the remaining seats were taken by them. 
Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Now, we can find out how many seats were left for the students. 
Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of street lights, we need to know how many poles there are and how many lights each pole has. We know that each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection. If there are 4 intersections, we multiply the number of poles at each intersection by the number of intersections to get the total number of poles. 

6 poles * 4 intersections = 24 poles

Now, we know that each pole has 4 street lights, so we multiply the total number of poles by 4 to get the total number of street lights.

24 poles * 4 street lights per pole = 96 street lights

But we also know that 20 street lights are not working. To find the number of working street lights, we subtract the number of non-working lights from the total number of lights.

96 street lights - 20 non-working lights = 76 working lights

The final answer is: 76"
"Let's figure this out. We have two DVDs. One has been played 356 times and the other has been played 135 times. We need to find out how many times we can play both of them before they break.

Each DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. So, we need to find out how many times are left for each DVD.

For the first DVD, we subtract the number of times it's already been played from 1000. That's 1000 - 356 = 644.

For the second DVD, we do the same thing. We subtract the number of times it's already been played from 1000. That's 1000 - 135 = 865.

Now, we add the remaining times for both DVDs together. 644 + 865 = 1509.

The final answer is: 1509"
"So John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. He went twice a week, for 2 hours each time. We need to find out how much it cost.

First, let's figure out how many times he went to physical therapy. He went 2 times a week for 6 weeks, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 times.

Now, we need to find out how many hours he went. He went 2 hours each time, so that's 12 times * 2 hours = 24 hours.

Each hour costs $125. So, to find the total cost, we multiply the number of hours by the cost per hour: 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

The final answer is: $3000"
"Let's figure out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day.

First, we need to find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours and school lasts 8 hours, we can divide 8 by 2 to find out how many pieces he chews at school. 
8 / 2 = 4

Then, Jim chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces. 
4 + 2 = 6

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum, so we subtract the pieces he's already chewed: 
20 - 6 = 14

Now, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find out how many pieces that is, we divide 14 by 2: 
14 / 2 = 7

Jim's sister takes 7 pieces, so we subtract that from the remaining gum: 
14 - 7 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we need to figure out her current age. We know she will be 16 years old in 12 years. 

To find her current age, we subtract 12 from 16: 
16 - 12 = 4

Now, we add 4 to her current age to find out how old she will be 4 years from now: 
4 + 4 = 8

So, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"Let's figure out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each. To find the total amount he spent, we multiply the number of baseballs by the cost of each baseball:
9 x $3 = $27

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each. To find the total amount he spent, we multiply the number of basketballs by the cost of each basketball:
8 x $14 = $112

Now, let's find the difference between the two amounts:
$112 - $27 = $85

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we need to know how many flowers are in the garden and what fraction of them have bloomed. 

There are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. To find the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row: 10 * 20 = 200.

Now, we know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers that is, we multiply 200 by 4/5. 

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (4) and then divide by the denominator (5). So, 200 * 4 = 800, and then 800 / 5 = 160.

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s first. 

Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing 20 by 1000. 

20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb/s to Mb/hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour. 

0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

So, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"So, let's figure out how many cars the tow truck pulled that week. It pulled 10 cars for each of the first three days. That's 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

Then, it pulled 4 fewer cars on each of the remaining days. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 7 - 3 = 4 remaining days. If it pulled 4 fewer cars on each of those days, that means it pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars on each of those days. So, the total number of cars it pulled on those days is 6 * 4 = 24.

Now, let's add the number of cars it pulled on the first three days to the number of cars it pulled on the remaining days. That's 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To figure out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to know how much taller he needs to be and how fast he grows.

The roller coaster is for people who are 4 feet tall, and since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we need to convert 4 feet to inches. 

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam is currently 40 inches tall, so we need to find out how many more inches he needs to grow to reach 48 inches.

48 inches (required height) - 40 inches (Adam's current height) = 8 inches

Adam grows 2 inches every year, so we need to divide the number of inches he needs to grow by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take.

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"So James sold 10 cars for $25,000 each. First, we need to find out how much money he made from selling the cars. 

To do that, we need to find out how much money he got from selling the cars, and then subtract the cost of the cars. The cost of the cars is 30% of $250,000 (10 cars * $25,000). 

30% of $250,000 is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000. So the cost of the cars is $75,000. 

Now, let's find out how much money James made from selling the cars. That's $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

But James didn't get to keep all of that money. He got a 10% commission on the profit. A commission is like a bonus for doing a good job. 10% of $175,000 is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

So James made $17,500."
"So, let's figure this out. We know that 25% of the riders can stay upright on the wave. To find 25% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.25. That's like moving the decimal point two places to the left. 

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright. Now, we need to find out how many of those 25 are women. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women. To find 60% of 25, we multiply 25 by 0.6.

25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we need to find out how many men can stay upright. If 15 are women, and there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright, then the number of men is 25 - 15.

25 - 15 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's figure out the total price for all three jewels.

First, we know that a diamond jewel costs $2000. Now, we need to find the price of the gold jewel. The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of the diamond jewel. To find 4/5 of $2000, we can multiply $2000 by 4 and then divide by 5.

4/5 of $2000 = ($2000 * 4) / 5
= $8000 / 5
= $1600

So, the price of the gold jewel is $1600. Now, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The price of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. To find the price of the silver jewel, we subtract $400 from $1600.

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now that we have the prices of all three jewels, we can find the total price by adding them together.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"Let's figure out how many stamps Max bought in total. 

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. Then, he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. 

Now, we need to find out how many rose stamps he bought. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's figure out how long it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob.

We know that Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom. Tom is driving 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving 55 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take for Tom to catch up, we need to know how fast Tom is closing the gap between them.

The difference in their speeds is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph. This is how fast Tom is closing the gap.

Now, we divide the distance between them (75 miles) by the speed at which Tom is closing the gap (15 mph).

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Let's figure this out. We know Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so we need to subtract 6 from 17 to find out how many fish Darren caught. 

17 - 6 = 11

So Darren caught 11 fish. Now, we know Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to add 3 to 11.

11 + 3 = 14

So Tommy caught 14 fish."
"Let's figure this out. Manny signed up for 10 karate classes for $60. His parents said they won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class. We need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again.

If Manny misses a class, he'll only pay $6 for that class. If he attends a class, he'll pay $10 for that class. We want to find the maximum number of classes he can miss.

Let's say Manny misses x classes and attends 10 - x classes. The total cost of classes should be $60.

The cost of the classes he misses is 6x (since he pays $6 per class for the classes he misses).
The cost of the classes he attends is 10(10 - x) (since he pays $10 per class for the classes he attends).

The total cost of classes is the sum of the cost of the classes he misses and the cost of the classes he attends. We can write an equation to represent this:

6x + 10(10 - x) = 60

Now, let's simplify the equation:

6x + 100 - 10x = 60
-4x + 100 = 60
-4x = -40
x = 10

But we can't have Manny miss 10 classes, because then he wouldn't have any classes to attend. So, we need to try a smaller number.

Let's try x = 9:

6(9) + 10(1) = 54 + 10 = 64 (this is too much, so x can't be 9)

Let's try x = 8:

6(8) + 10(2) = 48 + 20 = 68 (this is too much, so x can't be 8)

Let's try x = 7:

6(7) + 10(3) = 42 + 30 = 72 (this is too much, so x can't be 7)

Let's try x = 6:

6(6) + 10(4) = 36 + 40 = 76 (this is too much, so x can't be 6)

Let's try x = 5:

6(5) + 10(5) = 30 + 50 = 80 (this is too much, so x can't be 5)

Let's try x = 4:

6(4) + 10(6) = 24 + 60 = 84 (this is too much, so x can't be 4)

Let's try x = 3:

6(3) + 10(7) = 18 + 70 = 88 (this is too much, so x can't be 3)

Let's try x = 2:

6(2) + 10(8) = 12 + 80 = 92 (this is too much, so x can't be 2)

Let's try x = 1:

6(1) + 10(9) = 6 + 90 = 96 (this is too much, so x can't be 1)

Let's try x = 0:

6(0) + 10(10) = 0 + 100 = 100 (this is too much, so x can't be 0)

Wait, we can try x = 0, but we need to make sure that the total cost is $60. If Manny attends 10 classes, the total cost is $100, which is too much. If Manny attends 9 classes, the total cost is $64, which is too much. If Manny attends 8 classes, the total cost is $68, which is too much. If Manny attends 7 classes, the total cost is $72, which is too much. If Manny attends 6 classes, the total cost is $76, which is too much. If Manny attends 5 classes, the total cost is $80, which is too much. If Manny attends 4 classes, the total cost is $84, which is too much. If Manny attends 3 classes, the total cost is $88, which is too much. If Manny attends 2 classes, the total cost is $92, which is too much. If Manny attends 1 class, the total cost is $96, which is too much. If Manny attends 0 classes, the total cost is $100, which is too much.

However, we can try x = 0 and then add 1 to x. If Manny attends 0 classes, the total cost is $100, which is too much. If Manny attends 1 class, the total cost is $96, which is too much. If Manny attends 2 classes, the total cost is $92, which is too much. If Manny attends 3 classes, the total cost is $88, which is too much. If Manny attends 4 classes, the total cost is $84, which is too much. If Manny attends 5 classes, the total cost is $80, which is too much. If Manny attends 6 classes, the total cost is $76, which is too much. If Manny attends 7 classes, the total cost is $72, which is too much. If Manny attends 8 classes, the total cost is $68, which is too much. If Manny attends 9 classes, the total cost is $64, which is too much. If Manny attends 10 classes, the total cost is $60, which is just right.

So, if Manny attends 10 classes, he can miss 0 classes. If he attends 9 classes, he can miss 1 class. If he attends 8 classes, he can miss 2 classes. If he attends 7 classes, he can miss 3 classes. If he attends 6 classes, he can miss 4 classes. If he attends 5 classes, he can miss 5 classes. If he attends 4 classes, he can miss 6 classes. If he attends 3 classes, he can miss 7 classes. If he attends 2 classes, he can miss 8 classes. If he attends 1 class, he can miss 9 classes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"Let's figure out how many customers Julie and Jewel can serve in a week.

Jewel serves 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel serves 50 * 7 = 350 customers in a week.

Julie is twice as fast as Jewel, so she serves 50 * 2 = 100 customers per day. In a week, Julie serves 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

To find the total number of customers they serve together, we add their weekly totals: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"Let's figure out how many miles Lynn ran. We know Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 from Reggie's miles. So, Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to know how much 5 apples and 5 oranges cost separately.

First, let's find out how much 5 apples cost. We know that 4 apples cost $5.20. To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to multiply the cost of 4 apples by 5/4. 

Cost of 4 apples = $5.20
Cost of 5 apples = $5.20 * 1.25 = $6.50

Now, let's find out how much 5 oranges cost. We know that 3 oranges cost $3.30. To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to multiply the cost of 3 oranges by 5/3.

Cost of 3 oranges = $3.30
Cost of 5 oranges = $3.30 * 1.67 = $5.55

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.55 = $12.05

The final answer is: $12.05"
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to know the volume of the hole. The volume is like the amount of space inside the hole. To find the volume, we multiply the length, width, and depth of the hole.

Length = 6 feet
Width = 4 feet
Depth = 3 feet

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. To find the total time, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: 216"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add up the cost of the base price and all the extra features.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"So, Tim gets a promotion and it's a big deal. He gets a 5% raise on his monthly salary, which is $20,000. To find out how much more money he gets, we need to calculate 5% of $20,000. 

5% is the same as 0.05, so we multiply 0.05 by $20,000. That's 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. So, his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

But that's not all, he also gets a bonus. The bonus is half of his monthly salary, which is $20,000. So, the bonus is $20,000 / 2 = $10,000.

Now, let's add his new monthly salary and the bonus to find out how much he makes in a month. $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

To find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his monthly income by 12. $31,000 * 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"Let's figure out how much James spent on his new wardrobe.

First, we need to find out how much each item costs. 

The suits cost $750 each. James bought 10 suits, so that's 10 * $750 = $7500.

The dress pants cost 1/5 of what the suits cost. Since the suits cost $750, the dress pants cost $750 / 5 = $150 each. James bought 10 dress pants, so that's 10 * $150 = $1500.

The dress shirts cost $60 each. James bought 3 shirts for each suit, and he bought 10 suits. So, he bought 10 * 3 = 30 shirts. That's 30 * $60 = $1800.

Now, let's add up the costs: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to know how many articles each website publishes per day and how many days are in February.

The news website publishes 20 articles every day. Since February has 28 days, we multiply 20 articles by 28 days to get the total number of articles from the news website:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day. We multiply 10 articles by 28 days to get the total number of articles from the sister company:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we add the total number of articles from both websites:
560 articles (news website) + 280 articles (sister company) = 840 articles

The final answer is: 840"
"Let's figure out how old Steve's son's wife is.

First, we know Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Now, their son is half as old as his mom, so he is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to know how much flour is in one bag. Since the flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can find the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

8 portions * 2 kilograms per portion = 16 kilograms

Now, we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags. We can do this by multiplying the amount of flour in one bag by 3.

16 kilograms * 3 = 48 kilograms

"To find out how many miles Alisa biked, we need to multiply her speed by the time she biked. Her speed is 12 miles per hour, and she biked for 4.5 hours. So, 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles.

Now, let's find out how many miles Stanley biked. His speed is 10 miles per hour, and he biked for 2.5 hours. So, 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles.

To find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we add their individual distances: 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.

The final answer is: 79"
"Let's figure out how long it will take Bill to dig the well. He can dig 4 feet of soil in one hour. To find out how long it takes him to dig 24 feet of soil, we need to divide 24 by 4. 

24 ÷ 4 = 6 hours

Now, let's think about the clay. Bill digs through clay twice as slow as soil, so he digs 2 feet of clay in one hour. To find out how long it takes him to dig 8 feet of clay, we need to divide 8 by 2.

8 ÷ 2 = 4 hours

So, it takes him 6 hours to dig through the soil and 4 hours to dig through the clay. To find the total time, we add those two numbers together.

6 + 4 = 10 hours

"To find out how many cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to know how many people are getting cupcakes. There's Howie, his teacher, and 25 classmates. So, we add 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27 people.

Since each person gets 2 cupcakes, we multiply 27 by 2. 

27 * 2 = 54

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's figure out how many likes Fishio has on Instagram.

First, Fishio had 2000 likes on her selfie. Then, three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. That means she had 70 * 2000 = 140000 likes.

But we need to know how many likes she got in those three weeks. We know she got 20000 more likes recently, but we don't know how many she got in the three weeks before that. Let's think about it... If she had 140000 likes after three weeks, that means she got 140000 - 2000 = 138000 likes in those three weeks.

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the total number of likes after three weeks. So, 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"Let's figure out the difference in the prices Clara paid for pomegranates on two different days.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. But she got a $2 discount because she had a voucher. So, we need to subtract $2 from the total cost. The total cost is 20 * $20 = $400. Then we subtract $2, which is $400 - $2 = $398.

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate went up to $30. Clara bought 20 pomegranates again. The total cost is 20 * $30 = $600. But the store gave her a 10% discount. To find 10% of $600, we multiply $600 by 0.1, which is $60. So, we subtract $60 from $600, which is $600 - $60 = $540.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two prices. We subtract the smaller price from the bigger price: $540 - $398 = $142.

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's figure out how much money Ariadne made in two months.

First, we know that Ariadne made $400 from selling red hats in a month. We also know that this is half of what she made from selling green hats in the same month. So, if she made $400 from red hats, she must have made $400 * 2 = $800 from green hats.

Now, we know that the total money she made from both red and green hats in the first month is $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, she made 3/4 of the money she made in the first month. To find 3/4 of $1200, we multiply $1200 by 3 and then divide by 4. 

$1200 * 3 = $3600
$3600 / 4 = $900

So, in the second month, she made $900.

To find the total money she made in two months, we add the money she made in the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"Let's figure out how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage. He hired it from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. But he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. The next two hours cost twice as much as the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30. So, the second and third hours cost $30 each.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of all the paid hours: $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's figure out how much money was taken out of Sally's paycheck. 

We know Sally's bank account started with $200. Now it has $420. That means she got some money from her job, but not all of it. Her job should pay her $300 each week.

If she got all of her money, her account would have $300 + $200 = $500.

But it only has $420. So, we need to find out how much money is missing. To do that, we subtract $420 from $500.

$500 - $420 = $80

So, $80 was taken out of Sally's paycheck."
"To figure out how many eggs Lori needs, we need to know how many deviled egg halves her guests will eat. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she's inviting 16 guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat.

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Now, we need to know how many whole eggs Lori needs to make 48 deviled egg halves. Since each whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we divide 48 by 2.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per egg = 24 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide 24 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs.

24 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens of eggs

The final answer is: 2"

"So, James bought a plane for $150,000. He also pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger to keep it in. That's a lot of money! He also spends twice as much as that on fuel per month, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000. 

To find out how much he spends on fuel in a year, we multiply the monthly fuel cost by 12. So, $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, let's add up all the costs. The cost of the plane is $150,000. The hanger rental for a year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000. And the fuel cost for a year is $120,000. 

So, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice. Now, we need to find out how long it took her to cook the pork. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, we add 20 to 30, which is 50 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it took her to cook the beans. We know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. To find the combined cooking time, we add 30 (rice) and 50 (pork), which is 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

So, we have the cooking times for all the food: 
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Now, let's add them up: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

"Let's figure out how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

First, we need to find the cost of each mixture. 

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. Almonds cost $10 per pound, and walnuts cost $15 per pound. So, we multiply the weight of each nut by its cost per pound.

For the almonds: 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5
For the walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
The total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

Now, let's do the same for the second mixture. We have 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

For the almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
For the walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
The total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures. To do this, we subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture.

$10 (first mixture) - $7 (second mixture) = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"Let's say Lee has some sheep and some geese on his farm. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of legs is 70 and the total number of animals (sheep and geese) is 20.

Let's use a variable to represent the number of sheep. We'll call it S. Since the total number of animals is 20, the number of geese is 20 - S.

The total number of legs is 70, so we can write an equation: 4S (legs of sheep) + 2(20 - S) (legs of geese) = 70.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: 15"
"So, Roger goes to the store to buy some coffee. He usually buys a brand that costs $5 per pound, but that brand is sold out. He decides to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. 

To find out how much more the more expensive brand costs, we need to calculate 20% of $5. To do that, we multiply $5 by 0.2. 

0.2 * $5 = $1

So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so he needs 7 pounds for a week. 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42. 

He also buys a donut for $2. 

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"Let's figure out how much the apple pie cost. Gus spent $20.00 at the store. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00.

First, let's find out how much Gus spent on the chips. He bought 2 bags for $2.00 each, so that's 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00.

Next, we add the cost of the soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

So, Gus spent $13.00 on the chips, chicken, and soda. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to subtract $13.00 from the $20.00 he spent.

$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"Let's figure out how many newspapers James delivers to District B. We know he delivers a total of 600 newspapers in a day. He delivers 198 to District A and 209 to District C. To find out how many he delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total.

First, let's add the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C:
198 + 209 = 407

Now, let's subtract 407 from the total number of newspapers delivered:
600 - 407 = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."

The class meets 4 times a week, and each time it's 2 hours long. So, we need to multiply 4 by 2 to find out how many hours he spends in class each week. That's 4 x 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, we need to multiply 8 hours by 6 to find the total hours. That's 8 x 6 = 48 hours.

Now, we know that John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. To find out how many recipes he learns, we need to divide the total hours by 1.5. That's 48 ÷ 1.5 = 32.

So, John learns 32 recipes in his cooking class."
"So, there are 150 teachers on the basketball court. 60% of them are history teachers. To find out how many history teachers there are, we need to do some math. We multiply 60% by 150.

60% is the same as 0.6, so we multiply 0.6 by 150.

0.6 * 150 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. Now, we need to find out how many math teachers there are. We know there are 150 teachers in total, and 90 of them are history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract 90 from 150.

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. Now, we know each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find out how many hours the math teachers sleep in total, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep.

60 * 6 = 360

"Let's figure out how much money each person has. We know that Aurelia has $120. 

Kassidy has 3/4 of what Aurelia has. To find out how much Kassidy has, we need to multiply 120 by 3 and then divide by 4. 

3/4 of 120 is the same as 3 x 120 divided by 4. First, we multiply 3 and 120, which is 360. Then we divide 360 by 4, which is 90. So Kassidy has $90.

Now, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. To find out how much Rayna has, we add 60 to 90. 90 + 60 is 150. So Rayna has $150.

Now, we need to add up the money of all three and divide it by 3 to find out how much each person would have if they shared it equally. 

120 + 90 + 150 = 360. Now we divide 360 by 3. 360 divided by 3 is 120.

"Let's figure out how many good days Christina had left in the month.

We know that Christina recorded her mood every day for 30 days. The first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral. That's a total of 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 days.

Since there are 30 days in total, that means there are 30 - 24 = 6 days left. We also know that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. So, we need to subtract those 3 days from the 6 days left.

6 - 3 = 3

But we also know that Christina had 12 good days in total. We already know that the first 8 days and the last 3 days were good, which is 8 + 3 = 11 good days. 

Since Christina had 12 good days in total, the number of good days left is 12 - 11 = 1.

Let's call the number of books Sally has 'x'. So, Janey has 2 times 'x' plus 3 books. This can be written as 2x + 3. We know that 2x + 3 is equal to 21.

To find out how many books Sally has, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, we need to get 'x' by itself. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x / 2 = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books."
"Let's figure this out. We know that Mrs. Jameson's bamboo grows 30 inches a day. Right now, it's 20 feet tall. We need to find out how many days it will take for it to reach 600 inches.

First, we need to convert the 20 feet into inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We subtract the current height from the target height:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take the bamboo 12 days to reach 600 inches.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. That means each dog has 1 toy. Then, there are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. He already has 4 toys, so he needs 8 more. That's a total of 12 toys.

When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs as when he left. There were 8 dogs initially, so now there are 8 x 2 = 16 more dogs. That's a total of 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (initial additional dogs) + 16 (new dogs) = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys. So now he needs a total of 12 (initial toys) + 28 (additional toys) = 40 toys.

But then, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. That means he only needs 40 - 3 = 37 toys.

The final answer is: 37"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that three people invested a total of $1200. Dylan invested 2/5 of that amount. To find out how much Dylan invested, we need to multiply 2/5 by 1200.

2/5 of 1200 is the same as 2 x 1200 divided by 5. 

2 x 1200 = 2400
2400 divided by 5 = 480

So, Dylan invested $480. Now, we need to find out how much money was left after Dylan's investment.

1200 - 480 = 720

Now, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. To find out how much Frances invested, we need to multiply 2/3 by 720.

2/3 of 720 is the same as 2 x 720 divided by 3.

2 x 720 = 1440
1440 divided by 3 = 480

So, Frances invested $480. Now, we need to find out how much money was left after Frances' investment.

720 - 480 = 240

This means that Skyler's investment is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"Let's figure out how many signatures the sisters need to collect. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. To find the total number of signatures they have, we add them together.

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

They want to have 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the total they have from the total they want.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal.

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

The sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to know how much she earns per hour. We know that Karen earns twice as much as Lorie, and Lorie earns $10 per hour. So, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. She works 3 hours per day, so in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns we can make from 96 potatoes, we need to know how many hash browns we can make from 1 potato. 

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then we can divide 36 by 6 to find out how many hash browns 1 potato makes. 

36 / 6 = 6

So, 1 potato makes 6 hash browns. 

Now, we can multiply 6 hash browns by 96 potatoes to find out how many hash browns we can make in total.

6 * 96 = 576

Therefore, we can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

The final answer is: 576"
"Let's figure this out. We know that the elevator can hold a maximum of 700 kg. If Jack rides the elevator with 8 other adults, we need to find out how much they weigh in total.

Each adult weighs 80 kg, and there are 9 adults. To find the total weight, we multiply the number of adults by the weight of one adult.

9 adults * 80 kg = 720 kg

Now, we need to find out how much more weight the elevator can hold. We subtract the maximum weight from the total weight.

720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

So, they will exceed the maximum load by 20 kg."
"Let's figure out how many cookies they have in total.

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Now, we need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up the number of cookies each person has: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298

The final answer is: 298"
"Let's figure out the original length of the dress. We know that the final length is 140cm, and Shania added 20cm to the bottom of the dress. So, to find the original length, we need to subtract 20cm from 140cm.

140cm - 20cm = 120cm

But that's not the whole story. Shania also extended the dress by 50% of its original length. Let's call the original length 'x'. When you extend something by 50%, you're adding half of it back to itself. So, the extension is 0.5x.

Now, we know that the final length is the original length plus the extension. We can write an equation: x + 0.5x = 140 - 20.

Combine like terms: 1.5x = 120.

Now, divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's figure out how long it took Chris to mow his lawn. He has a two-speed lawn mower. He can mow the whole lawn in 1 hour in ""turtle"" mode, or 40 minutes in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to find out how long it took for each mode. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. So, in turtle mode, it took him 60 minutes to mow the whole lawn. To find out how long it took to mow half the lawn, we multiply 60 minutes by 0.5 (which is half).

60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes

Now, let's do the same for the rabbit mode. It took him 40 minutes to mow the whole lawn. To find out how long it took to mow half the lawn, we multiply 40 minutes by 0.5.

40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's figure this out. John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school together. They need to get to the corner where the library is first, which takes 6 minutes. Then, it takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

To find out how much longer they have to get to school, we need to subtract the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have. 

First, let's add the time it takes to get to the fire station: 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have: 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes.

So, they have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's figure out how much money Catherine paid at the grocery store.

She bought 1 kilo of apples for $4. 
She bought 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, so that's 2 x $2 = $4.

Now, let's add up the costs: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, so she bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add Greta's cookies to Celinda's cookies: 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 cookies, so we need to subtract 10 from the total: 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

So, there are 80 cookies left in the box.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's say the younger twin is T years old. The older twin is 7 years older, so the older twin is T + 7 years old. There are also triplets, and let's say they are t years old.

We know that the sum of their ages is 44. So, we can write an equation: T + (T + 7) + t = 44

We also know that the older twin is 7 years older than the triplet, so T + 7 = t + 7. This means that T = t.

Now, let's go back to the first equation: T + (T + 7) + t = 44. Since T = t, we can replace t with T: T + (T + 7) + T = 44

Combine like terms: 3T + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3T = 37

Divide by 3: T = 12.33

Since the older twin is 7 years older than the younger twin, the older twin is 12.33 + 7 = 19.33 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to know how much time he has before dinner and how much time he spends on homework.

John has 3 hours before dinner. We need to convert 3 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John spends on homework. He has 20 minutes of math, 40 minutes of reading, and 20 minutes of history. So, 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner. 180 - 80 = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"Let's figure out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo.

First, we need to know how much one lollipop costs and one candy costs. We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, 5 lollipops cost 5 x $0.40 = $2.00.

Now, let's find out how much 4 candies cost. We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20, so 4 candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

To find out how much one candy costs, we divide $1.20 by 4. $1.20 ÷ 4 = $0.30. So, one candy costs $0.30.

Now, let's find out how much 10 lollipops cost. 10 lollipops cost 10 x $0.40 = $4.00.

Next, let's find out how much 10 candies cost. 10 candies cost 10 x $0.30 = $3.00.

Finally, let's add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"Let's figure out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 more coins than Rong. To find out how many coins Neil saves, we need to multiply 20 by 2/5, which is the same as multiplying 20 by 0.4. 

20 * 0.4 = 8
20 + 8 = 28

So, Neil saves 28 coins every month. 

Now, let's find out how many coins they save in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply their monthly savings by 12.

Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's multiply their yearly savings by 10 to find out how many coins they save in 10 years.

Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

Now, let's add their total savings to find out how many coins they have after 10 years.

2400 + 3360 = 5760

The final answer is: 5760"
"So John went to the vet with his dog. The vet said his dog needs 2 shots, which cost $20 each, and a heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.

First, we need to find the total cost of the shots. There are 2 shots, and each one is $20, so that's 2 x $20 = $40.

Now, we need to find the cost of the heartworm check. It's 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 60% of x, or 0.6x.

The total bill is the cost of the shots plus the heartworm check, so we can write an equation: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, we need to get rid of the 0.4 in front of x. We can do this by dividing both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 x $100 = $60.

John paid $40 for the shots and $60 for the heartworm check, so he paid a total of $100.

John had $125 when he went to the vet, and he paid $100, so he has $125 - $100 = $25 left.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the price of the crate of fruit, we need to know how much each type of fruit costs. 

One apple costs $0.5. Since a banana costs twice as much as an apple, a banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

An orange costs three times as much as a banana, so it costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's find the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"Let's figure out how many square feet Brittany's comforter is. We know it has colored squares that are 1 foot by 1 foot.

There are 14 red squares. Then there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

Next, there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

Finally, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up the number of squares of each color: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.

So, the total number of squares is 68. Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"So, Mia's restaurant has a function tomorrow with 42 adults and 15 babies coming. They have 8 high chairs, and they have 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. To find out how many regular chairs they have, we multiply the number of high chairs by 5.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we need to know how many chairs they need in total. We add the number of adults and babies together.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 chairs needed

They already have 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs, so we add those together.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs available

Now, we need to find out how many more chairs they need. We subtract the number of chairs they have from the number of chairs they need.

57 chairs needed - 48 chairs available = 9 more chairs needed

"Let's figure out how many points the class is missing to go on a trip.

Adam has 50 points. Betty has 30% more points than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3. That's 0.3 x 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Now, let's find out how many points Tom has. We know Betty has 65 points and Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Next, we need to find out how many points Martha has. We know Tom has 35 points and Martha has 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha has 3 x 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up all the points: 50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Martha) = 255 points.

The minimum number of points needed to go on the trip is 400. To find out how many points they are missing, we subtract 255 from 400. That's 400 - 255 = 145 points.

First, we know Great Grandma Jones has 3 kids. Each of those kids has 3 kids of their own, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 grandkids.

Now, each of those 9 grandkids has 3 babies of their own, so we multiply 9 by 3 to find out how many great grand-babies there are. 9 x 3 = 27.

So, Great Grandma Jones will have 27 great grand-babies at the family reunion.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to do some math. First, we need to find out how much she puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her paycheck into it. 50% is the same as 0.5. So, we multiply 0.5 by $2400.00. That's 0.5 x $2400.00 = $1200.00.

Next, we need to find out how much she uses for her car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for that. 20% is the same as 0.2. So, we multiply 0.2 by $2400.00. That's 0.2 x $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, we need to subtract the amounts from her paycheck. We subtract $1200.00 and $480.00 from $2400.00. That's $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00.

"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see, we need to figure out how many fireworks are in the city display and how many she will set off in her backyard.

First, let's find out how many fireworks are in the city display. There are 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box has 20 fireworks. To find the total number of fireworks, we multiply 15 by 20:
15 * 20 = 300

Now, we need to find out how many of those fireworks Hannah can see. She can see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find 40% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.4:
300 * 0.4 = 120

Next, let's find out how many fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard. She will set off 3 boxes of fireworks, and each box has 5 fireworks. To find the total number of fireworks, we multiply 3 by 5:
3 * 5 = 15

"Let's figure out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry.

Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

If we add Gissela's and Gordy's trucks together, we get 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. But we know that all three trucks together can carry 11,600 pounds of gravel.

To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks. That's 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"Let's figure out how many dumplings Larry cooked.

There are 8 guys and 6 girls, so in total, there are 8 + 6 = 14 people.

Each girl ate 3 dumplings, so the girls ate a total of 6 x 3 = 18 dumplings.

Now, let's think about the guys. Each guy ate 1 more dumpling than each girl, so each guy ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

The guys ate a total of 8 x 4 = 32 dumplings.

To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to add the dumplings eaten by the girls and the guys. 18 (girls) + 32 (guys) = 50 dumplings.

So, Larry cooked 50 dumplings.

"Let's figure this out. Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. This means that for every 3 parts Gerald gets, Julia gets 2 parts. To find out how much money Gerald got, we need to add 3 and 2, which is 5 parts in total.

Since Gerald got 3 parts, we can find his share by dividing 100 by 5 and then multiplying by 3. 

Gerald's share = (100 / 5) * 3 = 60

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we need to subtract that from his share to find out how much he has left.

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10 = 50

"Let's figure this out. We know that Martha's cat can run 15 feet per second. We also know that her turtle is 5 times slower than the cat. To find out how fast the turtle is, we need to divide the cat's speed by 5.

15 feet/second (cat's speed) ÷ 5 = 3 feet/second (turtle's speed)

Now, we need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"So, the firefighters want to raise $6300. They already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. To find out how much they raise per hour, we need to divide the amount they raised by the number of hours. 

$2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. This means they use 40% of the total water.

Now, we're told that 80% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes. To find out how much water that is, we multiply 40% by 80% (or 0.8). 

40% * 0.8 = 32%. So, 32% of the river's total water is used by the city for industrial purposes.

To find out how much water is used for non-industrial purposes, we need to subtract the amount used for industrial purposes from the total amount used by the city. 

40% - 32% = 8%.

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is: 8"

"Let's figure out how much ice cream the factory makes in 48 hours.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find out how many quarts it makes per hour, we need to divide 100 by 2. That's 100 ÷ 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

Now, let's look at the vanilla ice cream. The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find out how many quarts it makes per hour, we need to divide 50 by 4. That's 50 ÷ 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now that we know how many quarts each type of ice cream makes per hour, we can multiply that by 48 to find out how many quarts each makes in 48 hours. 

For chocolate ice cream, that's 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.
For vanilla ice cream, that's 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream together. That's 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total bill, we need to add up the cost of all the items Marcus bought.

First, let's find the cost of the croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each is 5 x 3 = $15.00.

Next, we find the cost of the cinnamon rolls: 4 rolls at $2.50 each is 4 x 2.50 = $10.00.

Then, we find the cost of the mini quiches: 3 quiches at $4.00 each is 3 x 4 = $12.00.

Finally, we find the cost of the blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each is 13 x 1 = $13.00.

Now, we add up the cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount, we multiply $50.00 by 0.10, which is 0.10 x 50 = $5.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"Let's figure out how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy. Each scoop costs $1.50. Erin has $6.00. 

To find out how many scoops she can buy, we need to divide $6.00 by $1.50. 

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

But, the ice cream parlor has a deal where if you buy 2 scoops, you get 1 free. So, Erin can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. 

If Erin buys 2 scoops, she'll pay $3.00. Then, she'll get 1 scoop free. That's 3 scoops. 

She has $3.00 left, and she can use that to buy 2 more scoops. But, she can't get any more free scoops with the remaining money. 

So, Erin should buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, and then buy 2 more scoops. That's a total of 5 scoops.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's figure out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger after two weeks.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to find out how many pieces they eat in 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 x 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 x 14 = 42 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces of candy they have left. Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"Mr. Boarden is remodeling his bathroom. He needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot. If his bathroom is 36 square feet, we need to find out how many tiles he needs to cover two thirds of it.

To find two thirds of 36, we can multiply 36 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

36 * 2 = 72
72 / 3 = 24

So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 square feet. Now, we need to find out how many tiles he needs for 24 square feet. Since he needs 24 tiles for every square foot, we multiply 24 by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

Mr. Boarden needs 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his bathroom.

The final answer is: 576"
"Let's figure out how much James saved by picking blueberries.

First, we need to find out how much it cost James to pick the blueberries. He had to pay $20 to go picking, and then it cost him $1.5 per pound. He picked 30 pounds of blueberries, so we multiply 30 pounds by $1.5 per pound to get the total cost of the blueberries. That's 30 x 1.5 = 45 dollars. Then we add the $20 to go picking, so 45 + 20 = 65 dollars.

Now, let's find out how much it would have cost James to buy the blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries for $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds, so we multiply 30 pounds by $2.5 per pound to get the total cost of the blueberries. That's 30 x 2.5 = 75 dollars.

Now we know that James paid $65 to pick the blueberries and it would have cost him $75 to buy them at the store. To find out how much he saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store. That's 75 - 65 = 10 dollars.

The final answer is: $10"
"So, a company wants to buy 500 computers. They had $700 set aside for each computer. But when they went to order, they found out the price of each computer was $10 more than they thought.

To find out how much more they paid, we need to figure out the new price of each computer. We know the original price was $700, and it went up by 10%. To find 10% of $700, we multiply 0.1 by 700, which is 70. 

So, the new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they paid for 500 computers. We multiply 500 by $770, which is $385,000.

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's find the calories from the eggs. There are 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So, 6 eggs * 75 calories per egg = 450 calories.

Next, we need to find the calories from the cheese. There are 2 ounces of cheese, and each ounce is 120 calories. So, 2 ounces * 120 calories per ounce = 240 calories.

Lastly, we need to find the calories from the ham. There are 2 ounces of ham, and each ounce is 40 calories. So, 2 ounces * 40 calories per ounce = 80 calories.

Now, we add up all the calories: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The final answer is: 770"
"To find out how much change you would get, we need to know how much you spent on pencils and erasers. 

First, let's find out how much the pencils cost. There are 6 pencils and each pencil costs $0.50. So, we multiply 6 by $0.50 to get the total cost of the pencils. 

6 x $0.50 = $3

Next, we need to find out how much the erasers cost. There are 8 erasers and each eraser costs $0.25. So, we multiply 8 by $0.25 to get the total cost of the erasers.

8 x $0.25 = $2

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and the erasers together to get the total amount spent.

$3 + $2 = $5

You paid $10, so to find the change, we subtract the total amount spent from the $10.

$10 - $5 = $5

The final answer is: $5"
"So, let's say 100 people apply for a job at Google. That's a lot of people! Out of those 100, 30% get an interview. To find 30% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.3. That's 30 people who get an interview.

Now, out of those 30 people who got an interview, 20% get a job offer. To find 20% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.2. That's 6 people who get a job offer.

Finally, out of those 6 people who got a job offer, 1/3 of them accept the job. To find 1/3 of 6, we divide 6 by 3. That's 2 people who accept the job.

So, the answer is 2 people who accept the job.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's figure this out. Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. 

First, we need to find out how many sacks she gave away in total. We do this by adding the sacks she gave to her cousin and brother. 

3 + 4 = 7 sacks

Now, we know she gave away 7 sacks. Each sack has 25 kilograms of rice. To find out how many kilograms she gave away, we multiply the number of sacks by the weight of each sack.

7 * 25 = 175 kilograms

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to add up the boxes she bought this week and then subtract the boxes she bought last week.

This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. To find the total number of boxes she bought this week, we add 3 + 5. 

3 + 5 = 8

So, Castle bought 8 boxes of cereal this week.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

To find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we subtract 4 from 8.

8 - 4 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's figure out how many times Helga taps her feet. 

Helga can tap her right foot 300 times per minute and her left foot 250 times per minute when her arms are down. So, in one minute, she taps a total of 300 + 250 = 550 times.

If she dances for 3 minutes with her arms down, she will tap her feet 550 times per minute for 3 minutes, which is 550 * 3 = 1650 times.

When her arms are up, she taps her feet 200 times per minute. If she dances for 2 minutes with her arms up, she will tap her feet 200 times per minute for 2 minutes, which is 200 * 2 = 400 times.

To find the total number of times she taps her feet, we add the number of times she tapped her feet with her arms down and with her arms up. So, 1650 + 400 = 2050.

The final answer is: 2050"
"So, Ron is really mad about the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to cost him $450 to fix the damage to his car. But, if he fixes it himself, the city will fine him $120. He also needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, and each one costs $25.

First, let's figure out how much the asphalt costs. There are 3 buckets, and each one is $25, so that's 3 x $25 = $75.

Now, we need to add the fine to the cost of the asphalt. So, that's $75 + $120 = $195.

Now, we need to subtract the cost of fixing the pothole from the cost of not fixing it. That's $450 - $195 = $255.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is: $255"
"Let's count the chairs left at the restaurant. They have 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. If 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair, we need to subtract those from the total.

First, let's add the normal and baby chairs together: 170 + 23 = 193

Now, let's subtract the chairs that were sent for repair: 193 - 20 (normal chairs) - 13 (baby chairs) = 160

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza were eaten by Bryce and two of his friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we need to multiply the number of people (5) by 2/3 and 12 slices per person. 

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

But we know that 2 of these people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

40 slices - 24 slices = 16 slices

Now, we know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

Total number of slices = 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices
Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 16 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's figure this out. If a cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes, we need to find out how long it takes a dog to eat the same number of sausages. We're told the dog eats them in 2/3 the time the cat takes.

To find the time the dog takes, we multiply the time the cat takes by 2/3. So, 2/3 of 30 minutes is 20 minutes. That's how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages.

Now, we need to find the average time it takes both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. To do that, we add the time it takes the cat and the dog, and then divide by 2.

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = 20 minutes
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's figure out how long one of Bobby's shoes is. We know that Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. First, we need to change that to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 x 12 = 96 inches. Then we add 4 inches to that, so 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe 'x'. We can write an equation: x * 9 + 10 = 100.

To solve for 'x', we need to get rid of the 10 on the left side of the equation. We can do that by subtracting 10 from both sides: x * 9 = 90.

Now, we need to get 'x' by itself. To do that, we divide both sides of the equation by 9: x = 90 / 9.

x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's figure out how many windows Hannah smashed.

First, we need to find out how many windows she smashed from the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows from students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256. But Hannah only smashed a quarter of those windows, so we need to multiply 256 by 1/4. To do that, we can multiply 256 by 1 and then divide by 4. 256 * 1 = 256, and 256 / 4 = 64.

Next, let's find out how many windows she smashed from the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows from teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64. But Hannah smashed 3/4 of those windows, so we need to multiply 64 by 3/4. To do that, we can multiply 64 by 3 and then divide by 4. 64 * 3 = 192, and 192 / 4 = 48.

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars. 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to know how many blue spools there are and how many spools there are in total.

Candy has 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools. So, the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60.

Now, let's count all the spools. Candy has 15 light blue, 45 dark blue, 40 light green, and 50 dark green spools. So, the total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.

60 (blue spools) ÷ 150 (total spools) = 0.4
0.4 x 100 = 40%

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that 5000 people were at the polling station at 8:00. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. To find out how many people voted by midday, we need to multiply 2/5 by 5000.

2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, we need to find out how many people were left after midday. We subtract the number of people who voted by midday from the total number of people.

5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were left after midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. To find out how many people voted by 16:00, we multiply 2/3 by 3000.

2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

Now, we need to find out how many people had not voted by 16:00. We subtract the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the number of people left after midday.

3000 - 2000 = 1000 people had not voted by 16:00.

A pack of gum has 15 pieces of gum in it. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we divide the total number of pieces he will chew by the number of pieces in a pack: 120 / 15 = 8.

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To figure out how many boxes of graham crackers we need, we first need to know how many s'mores everyone wants. There are 9 kids and they each want 2 s'mores, so that's 9 x 2 = 18 s'mores. Then there are 6 adults and they each want 1 s'more, so that's 6 x 1 = 6 s'mores. 

Now we add the s'mores together: 18 (for the kids) + 6 (for the adults) = 24 s'mores. 

Each box of graham crackers has 3 sleeves, and each sleeve makes 8 s'mores. So, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves we need, and then divide that by 3 to find out how many boxes we need. 

24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

"Let's figure out the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

We know Dora is 15 years old. Her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we multiply Dora's age by 2 and add 8 to get her father's age. 

2 x 15 = 30
30 + 8 = 38

So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Now, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. To find her age, we subtract 4 from Dora's father's age.

38 - 4 = 34

So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

To find the total combined age, we add Dora's age, her father's age, and her mother's age together.

15 + 38 + 34 = 87

"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know that candidate A got 20% of the votes. To find out how many votes that is, we multiply 20% by 100. 20% is the same as 0.2, so 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Now, we know that candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. To find out how many votes that is, we need to add 50% of 20 to 20. 50% is the same as 0.5, so 0.5 * 20 = 10. Then we add 10 to 20, which is 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

We know that there are 100 voters in total. Candidate A and B got 20 + 30 = 50 votes. That means candidate C got the rest of the votes, which is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

He's going to make giant cubes that use 4 ounces each, medium cubes that use 2 ounces each, and small cubes that use 1/2 ounce each. He's making 3 giant cubes, 7 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes.

First, let's calculate how much water he uses for the giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces. Then, for the medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces. And for the small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces.

Now, let's add up all the water he used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces. This means he used 30 ounces of water.

To find out how much water he has left, we need to subtract the water he used from the total amount of water he started with: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"Let's figure out how much money Cecelia spent at the milk store. 

First, we need to know how much a half-gallon jar costs. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, to find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from $5.

$5 (gallon jar) - $2 = $3 (half-gallon jar)

Now, we know that a half-gallon jar costs $3. Cecelia bought 16 of these. To find the total cost of the half-gallon jars, we multiply the cost of one half-gallon jar by 16.

$3 (half-gallon jar) * 16 = $48

Next, we need to find the total cost of the gallon jars. Cecelia bought 10 of these. To find the total cost, we multiply the cost of one gallon jar by 10.

$5 (gallon jar) * 10 = $50

Now, we add the total cost of the half-gallon jars and the gallon jars to find out how much money Cecelia spent.

$48 (half-gallon jars) + $50 (gallon jars) = $98

"Let's figure this out. We know there are 50 students in the class. 10 of them like to bake, and 5 like to play basketball. That means there are 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 students left. These 35 students either like to play video games or play music.

We're also told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, that means 2 x 5 = 10 students like to play music.

So, if 10 students like to play music, that means 35 - 10 = 25 students like to play video games.

Now, we need to find out how many birds are left. We subtract 4 from 12: 
12 - 4 = 8

There are 8 birds left in the backyard. Then, 20 more birds joined them. To find the total number of birds now, we add 8 and 20: 
8 + 20 = 28

The final number of birds in the backyard is 28."

Now, let's add up all the animals: 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Now, we need to divide 28 by 7 to find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day.

28 ÷ 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day."
"Let's figure out how much money Mark made from selling the magic cards.

Mark bought 3 packs of cards for $1800 each. So, the total cost is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

Now, let's see how much money he made from selling the cards. He got one card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000. That's a total of $4000 + $1000 = $6000 from these two cards.

He also got 30 more cards that are worth an average of $50 each. So, the total value of these cards is 30 x $50 = $1500.

Now, let's add up the total value of all the cards: $6000 + $1500 = $7500.

To find out how much money Mark made, we need to subtract the cost from the total value: $7500 - $5400 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"Let's figure out how much Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

The first amusement park costs $26 for each adult and $12 for each child. If there are 2 adults and 2 children, we need to multiply the cost for adults and children by 2.

For adults: 2 x $26 = $52
For children: 2 x $12 = $24
Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

The second amusement park costs $14 for each adult and $10 for each child. Let's do the same thing:

For adults: 2 x $14 = $28
For children: 2 x $10 = $20
Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks:
$76 (first amusement park) - $48 (second amusement park) = $28

So, Jake's family can save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

The final answer is: $28"
"Let's figure out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week.

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. He used to buy them for 50 cents each, but now he buys them for 40 cents each. To find out how much he saves a day, we need to subtract the new cost from the old cost.

Old cost per day = 500 * 0.5
Old cost per day = 250 dollars

New cost per day = 500 * 0.4
New cost per day = 200 dollars

Daily savings = Old cost per day - New cost per day
Daily savings = 250 - 200
Daily savings = 50 dollars

Now, we need to find out how much he saves in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily savings by 7.

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = 50 * 7
Weekly savings = 350 dollars

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know that Sean has 56 marbles. We also know that Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. To find out how many marbles Cal has, we multiply the number of marbles Sean has by 2. 

56 * 2 = 112

So Cal has 112 marbles.

Now, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. To find out how many marbles Carl has, we multiply the number of marbles Sean has by 4.

56 * 4 = 224

So Carl has 224 marbles.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together.

112 (Cal) + 224 (Carl) = 336

The final answer is: 336"
"To find out how many more groups are needed, we need to know how many students are in each group. We have 54 students and we want to put them into groups. If we divide 54 by 6, we get 9. This means each group will have 9 students.

Now, we are told that we need 12 groups. To find out how many students we need in total, we multiply 12 groups by 9 students per group. 12 * 9 = 108. 

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find out how many more students we need. 108 - 54 = 54. This means we need 54 more students.

Since each group has 9 students, we need to divide 54 by 9 to find out how many more groups we need. 54 / 9 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's figure out how many chairs Candy rents out in two months. 

First, we need to find out how many chairs she rents out in a week. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. 

- On weekdays, she rents out 60 chairs/day * 5 days = 300 chairs
- On weekend days, she rents out 100 chairs/day * 2 days = 200 chairs
- So, in a week, she rents out 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, we need to find out how many weeks are in two months. There are 4 weeks in a month, so in two months, there are 4 weeks/month * 2 months = 8 weeks.

Now, we multiply the number of chairs she rents out in a week by the number of weeks in two months:
500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"Let's figure out how many bananas Gunther had left.

Gunther started with 48 bananas. Then, Arnold stole half of them. To find half of 48, we need to divide 48 by 2. 48 ÷ 2 = 24. So, Arnold stole 24 bananas, and Gunther was left with 24 bananas.

Next, Gunther added 25 more bananas to the pile. Now, he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

But Arnold didn't stop there. He stole 12 more bananas. To find out how many bananas were left, we need to subtract 12 from 49. 49 - 12 = 37.

Finally, Gunther added 6 more bananas to the pile. Now, we need to add 6 to 37. 37 + 6 = 43.

So, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile."
"So, let's figure this out. Jenna has 4 roommates and the electricity bill is $100 each month. To find out how much each roommate will pay, we need to divide the total bill by the number of roommates.

$100 ÷ 4 = $25

This is how much each roommate will pay per month. Now, we need to find out how much they will pay per year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the monthly amount by 12.

$25 * 12 = $300

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"Let's figure out how many glasses and plates Jeff has left.

First, we need to know how many glasses and plates he sent. He sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. 

A dozen is 12, so we multiply 8 by 12 to get the total number of glasses: 8 * 12 = 96 glasses.
We multiply 4 by 12 to get the total number of plates: 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Now, we know that 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. To find out how many are left, we subtract the number of broken items from the total number of items.

Glasses left: 96 - 10 = 86
Plates left: 48 - 6 = 42

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

The final answer is: 86"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.9. 30 * 0.9 = 27. So, she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. To find 50% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.5. 40 * 0.5 = 20. So, she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers, 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons. To find the total number of buttons, we add them all together: 3 + 20 + 27 + 20 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, we need to count the matches he played on each day. 

Joey played 2 matches on Monday. 
He played 1 match on Friday. 
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches played on each day: 
2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's say there are x votes against the new regulation. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there are against it, there are 2x votes in favor.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33. So, the total number of votes is also 33. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + 2x = 33

To solve for x, we need to combine the x's:

3x = 33

Now, we need to get x by itself. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 33 / 3
x = 11

So, there are 11 votes against the new regulation. Since there are twice as many votes in favor, there are 2x votes in favor:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, we need to figure out how many students need each size.

First, 11 students need extra-small shirts. Then, twice as many students need small shirts as extra-small, so that's 2 x 11 = 22 students.

Next, 4 fewer students need medium shirts than small, so that's 22 - 4 = 18 students.

After that, half as many students need large shirts as medium, so that's 18 / 2 = 9 students.

Finally, 6 more students need extra-large shirts than large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 students.

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the price after the discount, we need to subtract the discount from the original price. 

First, we need to find 5% of $140. To do this, we multiply 140 by 0.05 (since 5% is the same as 5/100 or 0.05).

140 * 0.05 = 7

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price.

140 - 7 = 133

So, the price after the discount is $133.

The final answer is: $133"
"To find out how long the 20 playlists will last, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to know how many songs there are in total. We have 20 playlists with 300 songs in each one. So, we multiply 20 by 300 to get the total number of songs.

20 * 300 = 6000 songs

Now, we know each song is 10 hours long. To find out how many hours all the songs will last, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song.

6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours

So, the 20 playlists will last 60000 hours."
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.2. That's 50 * 0.2 = 10 people.

Now, we need to find out how many people are left. We subtract the people who think horse #2 will win from the total number of people. So, 50 - 10 = 40 people.

Next, we know that 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. To find 60% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.6. That's 40 * 0.6 = 24 people.

Now, we need to find out how many people are left. We subtract the people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people. So, 40 - 24 = 16 people.

These 16 people think horse #12 will win.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's figure this out. We know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply 6 by 3 because 3 times 1/3 is 1, so it will give us the total number of Pomeranians.

6 * 3 = 18

So, there are 18 Pomeranians. Now, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply 18 by 3/2 because 2/3 is the same as 2 divided by 3, and 3/2 is the same as 3 divided by 2, so it will cancel out the 2 and 3, leaving us with 1, which will give us the total number of puppies.

18 * (3/2) = 18 * 1.5
18 * 1.5 = 27

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's say the second house needs x cases of shingles. The first house needs half of what the second house needs, so it needs x/2 cases of shingles. The third house needs double what the first house needs, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can write an equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Now, let's combine like terms: 5x = 500.

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

So, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much they spent, we need to add up the cost of all the things they bought.

Leila bought 3 cucumbers. Each cucumber costs $2, so she spent 3 x $2 = $6.

Jack bought 5 tomatoes. Each tomato costs $1, so he spent 5 x $1 = $5.

Chase bought 1 head of lettuce. Lettuce costs $3, so he spent $3.

Now, let's add up their totals: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"Let's figure this out. George has 200 bananas. We need to find out how many pears he has. We know he has 45% more pears than bananas. 

To find 45% of 200, we multiply 200 by 0.45. That's like moving the decimal point two places to the left. So, 200 * 0.45 = 90. 

Now, we add 90 to 200 to find the total number of fruits. 200 + 90 = 290.

So, George has a total of 290 fruits."

Now, we need to find out how much money Sam needs to spend on the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so we multiply the number of kilograms by the cost per kilogram: 20 * 3 = $60.

So, Sam needs to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"Let's figure this out. We know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour. We also know that he read twice as many books as Ahmed. So, to find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide 300 by 2.

300 / 2 = 150

So, Ahmed read 150 books. Now, we know that Ezra is going to read 150 more books. That means he will have read a total of 300 + 150 = 450 books.

Now, we need to find out how many books both Ezra and Ahmed read altogether. We already know that Ahmed read 150 books and Ezra will read 450 books. So, we just need to add those two numbers together.

150 + 450 = 600

"Let's figure out how much Tanya earned for teaching. 

First, we need to find out how much she earned for each day. On Monday, she taught 4 classes for 5 hours. We need to multiply the number of hours by her hourly wage, which is $15. So, 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5. So, her total for Monday is $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she taught 2 classes for 2 hours. We multiply the hours by her hourly wage again: 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. But she didn't teach more than 3 classes, so she doesn't get the extra $5. So, her total for Wednesday is $30.

Now, we add the totals for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

"Let's figure out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for. 

First, we need to know how much money he makes from selling the eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so we multiply 20 by 3 to find the total amount he makes from eggplants. 

20 * 3 = 60

Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from eggplants. To find out how much he needs to make from corn, we subtract 60 from 135.

135 - 60 = 75

Now, we know Bennet needs to make $75 from selling the corn. He has 25 ears of corn, so we need to divide 75 by 25 to find out how much he should sell each ear for.

75 ÷ 25 = 3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"Let's figure out how much of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer.

First, we need to know how many hours she has in total. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. So, that's 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

Now, let's see how much time she spends reading. She reads for 3 hours.

Next, we need to find out how much time she spends playing video games. She plays video games for 1/3 of the time left after reading. To find 1/3 of the time, we need to divide the time left by 3. The time left is 12 - 3 = 9 hours. So, 1/3 of 9 is 3 hours.

Now, let's find out how much time she spends playing soccer. We know she reads for 3 hours and plays video games for 3 hours. So, she spends 3 + 3 = 6 hours doing those two things. That means she spends 12 - 6 = 6 hours playing soccer.

To find the percentage of the weekend she spends playing soccer, we need to divide the time she spends playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100. So, that's 6 ÷ 12 = 0.5, and 0.5 x 100 = 50%.

"Let's figure out how many pencils Anthony kept.

First, Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of them to Brandon. To find 1/2 of 50, we can multiply 50 by 1/2. That's the same as dividing 50 by 2. 50 divided by 2 is 25. So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon.

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find 3/5 of 25, we can multiply 25 by 3 and then divide by 5. 25 multiplied by 3 is 75, and 75 divided by 5 is 15. So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, we need to find out how many pencils Anthony has left. We know he had 25 pencils and gave 15 to Charlie. To find out how many he has left, we subtract 15 from 25. 25 - 15 = 10.

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to figure out how long it takes him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's find out how long it takes him to drive to the museum. We know the distance is 150 miles and he drives 75 miles per hour. To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed: 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours.

Since he has to drive back home, it will take him another 2 hours. So, in total, it takes him 2 + 2 = 4 hours to drive to the museum and back.

Now, we need to add the time he spends at the museum, which is 6 hours. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is 4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours.

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800."
"Let's figure out how much it costs to replace Mike's movie collection.

First, we need to find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we divide 600 by 3:
600 ÷ 3 = 200 movies in series

These movies cost $6 each, so we multiply 200 by 6:
200 × 6 = $1200

Now, we need to find out how many movies are left. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

Next, we need to find out how many of these movies are older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply 400 by 0.4:
400 × 0.4 = 160 older movies

Older movies cost $5 each, so we multiply 160 by 5:
160 × 5 = $800

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

Normal movies cost $10 each, so we multiply 240 by 10:
240 × 10 = $2400

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to figure out how far they drove and how far they hiked, then add those two numbers together.

First, let's find out how fast they hiked. They hiked at a speed that was 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed. They drove at 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find out how far they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find out how far they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot: 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ava and Emma are playing a video game. They get points for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and finishing the level on time. 

For every enemy they jump on, they get 10 points. For every berry they collect, they get 5 points. For every second they have left on the timer when they finish the level, they get 30 points.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries. But she finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Let's say Emma jumps on x enemies, collects y berries, and finishes the level in z seconds. Then Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies, collects y + 3 berries, and finishes the level in z + 4 seconds.

Emma's score is 10x (for enemies) + 5y (for berries) + 30z (for time). Ava's score is 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(z + 4 - 4).

Simplifying Ava's score, we get 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30z.

Now, let's find the difference between their scores. The difference is (10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30z) - (10x + 5y + 30z).

The x and y terms cancel out, and we're left with 80 + 15 - 30z - 30z. This simplifies to 95 - 60z.

We don't know the value of z, but we do know that Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. So, z + 4 = 60 (since the level is 60 seconds long). This means z = 56.

Now we can plug in z = 56 into the equation 95 - 60z. This gives us 95 - 60(56) = 95 - 3360 = -3265. But this can't be right, since scores can't be negative.

Let's try a different approach. We know that Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she has 56 seconds left on the timer. Emma has 60 seconds left on the timer. 

Ava's score for time is 30(56) = 1680. Emma's score for time is 30(60) = 1800.

Ava's score for enemies is 10(x + 8) and Emma's score for enemies is 10x. The difference in their enemy scores is 10(x + 8) - 10x = 80.

Ava's score for berries is 5(y + 3) and Emma's score for berries is 5y. The difference in their berry scores is 5(y + 3) - 5y = 15.

The difference in their scores is 1680 + 80 + 15 - (1800 + 0 + 0) = -25.

The final answer is: -25"
"Let's figure this out. We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. We need to find out how much the other two pizzas cost if they cost the same amount.

First, we need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that we already know. Since they cost 30 dollars each, we multiply 30 by 2 to get the total cost of these two pizzas.

30 * 2 = 60 dollars

Now, we need to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. We know that the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. So, we subtract the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas.

64 - 60 = 4 dollars

This means that the other two pizzas together cost 4 dollars. Since they cost the same amount, we divide 4 by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 / 2 = 2 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas costs 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to figure out how many times they ride on regular days and how many times they ride on the extra days.

They ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. That's 3 x 5 = 15 times.

Then, they ride twice as many times on two extra days. That's 2 x 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, that's 6 x 2 = 12 times.

So, in total, they ride 15 + 12 = 27 times in a week.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. He went to the pet store and got 17 fish. When he got home, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's say he got W white fish and O orange fish. We know that 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We also know that W + O = 17, because he got 17 fish in total.

Now, let's solve the first equation for O: O = 2(4 + W) - 3 = 8 + 2W - 3 = 5 + 2W.

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the second equation: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combine like terms: 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to know how far he drives and how much gas his car uses.

Andy drives to work and back home every day, so that's 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day. He does this 5 days a week, so he drives 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we need to know how much gas his car uses. His car gets 10 miles per gallon, so to find out how much gas it uses, we divide the total miles driven by the miles per gallon: 50 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons/week.

The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so we multiply the amount of gas used by the price per gallon: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's figure out how much money Carrie spent for lunch.

First, we need to find out how much money she got from the quarters. Since there are 4 quarters in a dollar, we multiply the number of quarters by 0.25 (which is the value of one quarter). 

140 quarters * 0.25 = 35 dollars

Now, let's find out how much money she got from the twenties. Since there are 10 twenties, we multiply 10 by 20 (the value of one twenty).

10 twenties * 20 = 200 dollars

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of 200, we multiply 200 by 3 and then divide by 5.

(200 * 3) / 5 = 600 / 5 = 120 dollars

Now, we add the money she got from the quarters and the twenties she spent. 

35 dollars + 120 dollars = 155 dollars

The final answer is: $155"
"Let's count the fruits that Ricardo can get from his plants.

Ricardo has 5 tomato plants. Each tomato plant gives 22 tomatoes. So, we multiply 5 by 22 to find the total number of tomatoes: 5 * 22 = 110 tomatoes.

Ricardo also has 8 eggplant plants. Each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants. So, we multiply 8 by 4 to find the total number of eggplants: 8 * 4 = 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits: 110 + 32 = 142.

The final answer is: 142"
"Let's figure out how many OLED TVs Samwell sold. 

First, we know that one-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs. To find one-fourth of 40, we multiply 40 by 1/4. That's the same as dividing 40 by 4. 40 ÷ 4 = 10. So, Samwell sold 10 smart TVs.

Next, we know that one-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs. To find one-eighth of 40, we multiply 40 by 1/8. That's the same as dividing 40 by 8. 40 ÷ 8 = 5. So, Samwell sold 5 analog TVs.

Now, we know that Samwell sold 10 smart TVs and 5 analog TVs. To find the total number of smart and analog TVs, we add 10 + 5. That's 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold. 40 - 15 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"So, John is trying to raise money for a school trip. The school is going to help him out by paying for half of the trip. The trip costs $300. 

To find out how much the school will pay, we need to divide the cost of the trip by 2. 

$300 ÷ 2 = $150

So, the school will pay $150. John already has $50. To find out how much more money John needs, we need to subtract the amount he has from the amount the school will pay.

$150 - $50 = $100

John is missing $100."
"So, Carson lives in an old house where the pipes will freeze if it gets too cold. The house gets really cold at night, 33 degrees colder than it is during the day. It was 45 degrees during the day, so at night it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

We need to get the temperature up to 32 degrees so the pipes don't freeze. To do that, we need to figure out how many degrees we need to heat the house. That's 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs we need, we divide the total degrees we need to heat the house by the number of degrees each log heats it up: 20 / 5 = 4.

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to keep the pipes from freezing."
"To find out how many seashells they brought back, we need to know how many groups there were and how many groups brought back seashells.

First, let's find out how many groups there were. We know that 90 people were split into groups of 9 people each. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group.

Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Now, we need to find out how many groups brought back seashells. We know that 3 out of 5 groups brought back seashells. To find the number of groups that brought back seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by the fraction of groups that brought back seashells.

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we need to find out how many seashells they brought back. We know that each group that brought back seashells brought 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by the number of seashells per group.

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's figure out how many people are on the train.

We start with 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off. To find out how many people are left, we subtract 47 from 172.

172 - 47 = 125

Now, 13 more people get on the train. We add 13 to 125 to find the new total.

125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people get off. To find out how many people are left, we subtract 38 from 138.

138 - 38 = 100

So, there are 100 people on the train.

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's figure out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month. 

Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day on his way home. Each bottle cap is worth $0.25. To find out how much money he makes in a day, we multiply the number of bottle caps he finds by the value of each cap.

10 bottle caps * $0.25 = $2.50 per day

Now, we need to find out how much he makes in 30 days. We multiply the daily amount by 30.

$2.50 * 30 = $75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to know how much she earns for regular hours and extra hours. 

Jamie earns $20 per hour for regular hours. She worked 8 hours, so she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For extra hours, she earns 150% of her regular rate. 150% of $20 is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. She worked 3 extra hours, so she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

To find her total earnings, we add the money she earned from regular hours and extra hours. $160 + $90 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to count the female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. 

There are 12 female lions. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can find the number of male lions by dividing 12 by 2. 12 divided by 2 is 6, so there are 6 male lions.

We also know there are 14 lion cubs.

Now, let's add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions: 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"So, Mike wants to buy a pair of jeans that originally costs $40. But, they're on sale for 25% off. That means he gets 25% of the original price off. 

To find 25% of $40, we multiply 40 by 0.25. That's because 25% is the same as 0.25. So, 40 x 0.25 = 10. That means the jeans are $10 cheaper.

Now, we need to find out how much Mike will pay for the jeans. We subtract the discount from the original price: $40 - $10 = $30.

Mike is paying with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he'll have left, we subtract the price of the jeans from the $50 bill: $50 - $30 = $20.

So, Mike will have $20 left over."
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we need to know how many employees the company will have after 3 months. They start with 200 employees and hire 20 new employees every month. So, after 3 months, they will have:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

Now, we need to find out how much money the company pays each month. They pay each employee $4000 per month, and they have 260 employees. So, the total amount they pay each month is:
260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount they pay is:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"To find out how long the choir will be caroling, we need to add up the time it takes to sing each song. 

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, and they're going to sing it twice. So, we multiply 150 by 2 to get the total time for ""Deck the Halls"". 
150 * 2 = 300 seconds

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long. 

Now, we add the time for ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"" together to get the total caroling time.
300 + 240 = 540 seconds

The final answer is: 540"
"Let's figure out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally.

Billy was first paid $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new pay is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. Then, after a year, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his pay $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's pay is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's first pay, so she makes $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much they earn in 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to know the cost of each. 

A loaf of bread costs $2 and a bagel costs $1. 

First, let's find the cost of 3 loaves of bread: 3 x $2 = $6.

Next, let's find the cost of 2 bagels: 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels. To do this, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

Pierson scored 278 points. Half of 278 is 139. 

Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"So, let's figure this out. There are 40 classes in the school. Each class has 25 students, and each student plants 1 tree. So, we multiply the number of classes by the number of students per class to find out how many students are planting trees.

40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Now, we know that each student plants 1 tree, so we multiply the number of students by 1.

1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Next, we need to find out how many trees the teachers are planting. There are 40 classes, and each class has 3 teachers. So, we multiply the number of classes by the number of teachers per class.

40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so we multiply the number of teachers by 2.

120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the total number of trees planted.

1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals she has. 

First, let's add up the number of stuffed animals she already has: 

3 puppies + 5 koalas + 2 zebras + 4 frogs = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of 14. 

To do this, we can multiply 14 by 0.3: 

14 * 0.3 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more. 

Let's try to find the total number of stuffed animals she needs to have to make the percentage 30%. 

If 30% of the total number of stuffed animals is 4.2, then 100% of the total number of stuffed animals is 14 / 0.3 = 46.67. 

Since Bubbles can't have a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, she needs to have at least 47 stuffed animals to make the percentage 30%. 

Since she already has 14 stuffed animals, she needs to buy 47 - 14 = 33 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's say we have two cars on the highway. One car is going 60 miles per hour, and the other car is going 70 miles per hour. We want to know how far apart they will be after 2 hours.

To find out how far each car will travel, we multiply their speed by the time they've been traveling. 

The first car is going 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is going 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Now, we need to find out how far apart they are. To do this, we subtract the distance the first car traveled from the distance the second car traveled: 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

So, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart."
"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold. 

Cost of diamond: $600
Cost of gold: $300
Total cost of diamond and gold: $600 + $300 = $900

Now, we need to add a 30% premium to this total. A 30% premium means we need to find 30% of $900 and add it to the total.

To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3. 

0.3 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold.

$900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to know how many students passed and how many students there are in total.

First, let's find out how many students passed in each grade. We know that 340 out of 500 third-graders passed. That's 340/500. We also know that 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, which is 40/100. 

Now, let's find out how many fifth-graders passed. We know that their pass rate is twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders. Since the fourth-graders passed at a rate of 40/100, the fifth-graders passed at a rate of 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, 80 out of 400 fifth-graders passed.

Now, let's add up the number of students who passed in each grade: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460.

Next, let's find the total number of students: 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

Now, we can find the overall pass rate: (460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

"Let's figure out how long Milo can make his mosaic. We know that it takes 12 glass chips to make one square inch of the mosaic. Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag has 72 chips.

First, we need to find out how many chips Milo has in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of bags by the number of chips in each bag.

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. We can do this by dividing the total number of chips by the number of chips it takes to make one square inch.

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we need to find out how long it can be. We know that the area of a rectangle (like the mosaic) is length * width. We know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), so we can find the length.

Area = length * width
12 = length * 3
To find the length, we need to divide both sides by 3.

12 / 3 = length
length = 4

So, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long."
"Let's figure out how many gallons of tea were at the party at the beginning.

First, we need to find out how much tea was drank in total. Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so that's 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. Then, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so that's 16 x 2 = 32 quarts. 

Now, we add the two amounts together: 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. This is the total amount of tea drank.

We know there are 4 quarts in a gallon. To find out how many gallons were drank, we divide 38 by 4. But we're trying to find out how many gallons were at the party at the beginning, not how many were drank. We know there are 10 quarts of tea left.

To find the total amount of tea at the beginning, we add the amount drank to the amount left: 38 (tea drank) + 10 (tea left) = 48 quarts.

Now, we divide 48 by 4 to find out how many gallons there were at the beginning: 48 ÷ 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's figure out how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell.

Dale started with 100 candies. He sold 150, but that means he doesn't have 100 candies left. He needs to get more candies to sell. So, he ordered 100 more. Now, he has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 candies.

Since he sold 150 candies, he still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

In February, it doubles again to 40. 
In March, it doubles to 80. 
In April, it doubles to 160. 
In May, it doubles to 320.

Now, let's find out how many more students joined by the end of May. We subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

"So, Felix is making money by climbing trees to get kids' stuff out. He charges 25 cents for every branch he has to climb. He made a total of $105 during the week. To find out how many branches he climbed, we need to divide the money he made by the cost per branch.

To do this, we divide $105 by $0.25. 

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420

Since Felix worked for 5 days, we need to find out how many branches he climbed on average per day. To do this, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days.

420 ÷ 5 = 84

So, Felix climbed an average of 84 branches per day."
"Let's figure out how many petals are in the vase. 

First, Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each. That's 3 x 5 = 15 petals.

Then, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. That's 4 x 6 = 24 petals.

Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each. That's 5 x 4 = 20 petals.

Finally, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. That's 6 x 7 = 42 petals.

Now, let's add up all the petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

But then, she drops 1 petal from each of the 4 sets of flowers. That's 4 petals in total. So, we need to subtract 4 from 101: 101 - 4 = 97 petals.

The final answer is: 97"
"Let's figure out how many S'mores each kid can have. First, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag. We know that John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, and they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

To find out how many marshmallows they used, we add the number of S'mores John made to the number of S'mores DeSean made. 9 + 9 = 18. Then, we add the 3 marshmallows they dropped. 18 + 3 = 21. This means they used or dropped 21 marshmallows.

Now, we need to subtract 21 from the total number of marshmallows in the bag to find out how many are left. There were 35 marshmallows in the bag. 35 - 21 = 14. So, there are 14 marshmallows left.

Since there are 2 kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have. 14 ÷ 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's figure out how much money is used at the arcade.

Jack and his friends play for 4 hours. We need to convert 4 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is 4 x 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's think about how long each of Jack's friends play. Two of his friends are not as good as him, so they play for half the time. That's 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. The other friend is better than Jack, so he plays for 1.5 times as long, which is 240 x 1.5 = 360 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time they all play: 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Each of them can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. So, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

To find the total amount of money used, we multiply the total time played (840 minutes) by the cost per minute ($0.05). That's 840 x 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"Let's figure out how much oil Tanya uses to make her salt scrub.

We know that Tanya makes a 10-ounce jar of scrub. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. She also uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's say the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) is x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to add up the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows.

First, let's find the cost of the goats. John bought 3 goats for $500 each. So, we multiply 3 by 500 to get the total cost of the goats.

3 x 500 = 1500

Now, let's find the cost of the cows. John bought 2 cows for $1500 each. So, we multiply 2 by 1500 to get the total cost of the cows.

2 x 1500 = 3000

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to get the total amount of money John spent.

1500 + 3000 = 4500

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. 

First, let's add the number of chocolate and toffee cupcakes he already has: 8 + 40 = 48

Now, we need to subtract 48 from 63 to find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy: 63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Now, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2. That's 40 * 0.2 = 8 cars.

Next, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

In total, Joe gives away 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

So, Joe has 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"So, let's figure out how much each student raised for the charity. The charity got a total of $175,000. But $50,000 of that came from organizations, so we need to subtract that from the total to find out how much the students raised.

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we know the students raised $125,000. There are 20 students, so we need to divide the total amount they raised by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. We need to convert this to minutes because the answer is asked in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 8 hours is 8 x 60 = 480 minutes.

On the second day, Sandy walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day. Since she walked 8 hours on the first day, she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day. We need to convert this to minutes too, so 4 hours is 4 x 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, we add the time from both days together: 480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"So, let's figure this out. Hunter counted 50 cars when he first got to school. Then, 20 more cars came during the first break. That makes 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

But then, when he went out for lunch, half of the cars left. Half of 70 is 35, so 35 cars left. That means there were 70 - 35 = 35 cars left in the parking lot.

So, when Hunter went out for lunch, there were 35 cars in the parking lot. The final answer is: 35"
"Let's figure out how much John makes in a week. 

John does 30 cycles of work a day. Each cycle has 5 different tasks, and each task pays $1.20. 

First, we need to find out how much John makes in a day. We can do this by multiplying the number of cycles he does in a day by the number of tasks in each cycle and the pay per task.

Number of cycles per day: 30
Number of tasks per cycle: 5
Pay per task: $1.20

Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Now, we need to find out how much John makes in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"Let's figure out how many points Sasha scored in the two basketball games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points because she had the home court advantage. 

Now, let's think about the second game. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie scored in the first game. We know Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. So, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

Since Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's figure this out. Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and 6 packages of dog food. Each package of cat food has 11 tins, and each package of dog food has 6 tins.

To find out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find out how many tins of dog food Kimberly bought, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought. To do that, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's say PJ has a certain number of cards, and we'll call that number x. Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ, so Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. We can write an equation to represent this:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

So PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"So, let's figure out how many eggs Cindy had altogether. 

First, we know Cindy had 5 green eggs. Then, she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, which means she had 2 x 5 = 10 blue eggs.

Next, she had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, which means she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's find the cost of shipping. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles. So, the cost of shipping is (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20).

First, let's multiply 0.35 by 4: 0.35 * 4 = 1.4. Then, multiply 0.08 by 20: 0.08 * 20 = 1.6. Now, let's add those two numbers together: 1.4 + 1.6 = 2.99.

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price. To find 75% of $32, we multiply 0.75 by 32: 0.75 * 32 = 24.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose. We need to add the cost of shipping to the difference between the purchase price and the refund amount. The purchase price is $32, and the refund amount is $24. So, the difference is 32 - 24 = 8. Now, let's add the cost of shipping to that: 2.99 + 8 = 10.99.

The final answer is: $10.99"
"Let's figure out how much money Mulan has left.

First, Mulan's dad gave her $100. So now she has $40 (the money she already had) + $100 (the money her dad gave her) = $140.

Next, Mulan buys two pairs of jeans for $30 each. That's 2 * $30 = $60.

She also buys a bag for $20.

So, the total amount of money she spent is $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.

Now, we need to subtract the money she spent from the money she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's figure out how much chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week.

Boris makes 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week. Then, in the second week, he makes half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

Now, let's think about the third week. Boris makes three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

So, in the first three weeks, Boris makes 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Boris makes a total of 50,000 bars in a month. To find out how many bars he makes in the fourth week, we need to subtract the total bars he made in the first three weeks from the total bars he makes in a month.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate how much time she spends on it each week and then multiply that by 4.

First, let's figure out how much time she spends on writing songs. She spends 2 hours a week doing that. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 2 hours by 60 to get 120 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how much time she spends on makeup. She does her makeup for 15 minutes, 6 days a week. So, we multiply 15 minutes by 6 to get 90 minutes.

Now, let's calculate how much time she spends recording videos. She records 18 videos a week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, we multiply 18 videos by 4 minutes to get 72 minutes.

Now, we add up all the time she spends on TikTok each week: 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes.

To make it easier to understand, let's convert the total minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 282 minutes by 60 to get 4.7 hours.

Finally, we multiply the time she spends on TikTok each week by 4 to find out how much time she spends in a month: 4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: 18.8"
"Let's figure out how much it will cost Angela to get her stuff installed.

The interior design firm charges $129.00 for the basic installation. This includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. We need to find out how much it will cost to install the extra stuff.

For the mirrors, she has 6, but the basic installation already includes 4, so we need to install 2 more. That will cost 2 x $15.00 = $30.00.

For the chandeliers, she has 2, but the basic installation already includes 1, so we need to install 1 more. That will cost 1 x $15.00 = $15.00.

For the pictures, she has 20, but the basic installation already includes 10, so we need to install 10 more. That will cost 10 x $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, let's add up the cost of the extra stuff: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

So, the total cost will be the cost of the basic installation plus the cost of the extra stuff: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Then, Anthony saved $10.00 more than Eva, so he saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Roy saved than Anthony. It says Roy saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of $30.00, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4. That's $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.

So, Roy saved $12.00 more than Anthony. To find out how much Roy saved in total, we add $12.00 to $30.00. That's $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches high.

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. To find out how high Kagiyami can lift, we multiply 12 by 4. 12 * 4 = 48 inches.

Now, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. To find out how high Naruto can lift, we multiply 48 by 10. 48 * 10 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet. We do this by dividing 480 by 12. 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's figure out how far Mason traveled on his bike. 

First, we need to know how fast he was going and how long he was traveling. Mason was going 8 miles per hour. He traveled for 4 hours, then took a break, and then traveled for another 6 hours.

To find out how far he went in the first 4 hours, we multiply 8 miles per hour by 4 hours. That's 8 x 4 = 32 miles.

Then, we do the same thing for the next 6 hours. We multiply 8 miles per hour by 6 hours. That's 8 x 6 = 48 miles.

Now, we add the two distances together to find the total distance. 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's say we have three kangaroos that can travel across a highway in 18 hours. If we want to know how long it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway, we can multiply the time it takes for three kangaroos by 3. This is because if three kangaroos take 18 hours, one kangaroo would take 18 * 3 = 54 hours.

Now, let's say we have four turtles that travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. Since they're slower, it will take them longer to cross the highway. To find out how long it takes for the turtles, we need to multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2 (because they're half as fast) and then multiply that by 4 (because there are four turtles). So, it would be 54 * 2 * 4 = 432 hours.

However, we can simplify this by multiplying 54 by 8 (since 2 * 4 = 8), which gives us 432 hours.

The final answer is: 432"
"Let's figure out how many clay dishes Jada, Rory, and Kora made together.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of dishes they made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"Let's figure out how much money Erika has in her purse. 

First, we need to know how much the new laptop costs after she trades in her old one. The new laptop costs $600, and if she trades it in, she gets a discount of $200. So, the new price is: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika got paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80. So, she got a total of: 
$150 + $80 = $230

Now, we know that Erika needs $50 more to buy the laptop. This means she already has $50 in her purse. To find out how much she had before getting paid and her mom's help, we need to subtract the $230 from the $50. But that's not right, because we need to find out how much she had before getting the $50. So, we need to add the $50 to the $230, and then subtract that from the price of the laptop after the trade-in. 
$400 + $50 = $450

Now, we subtract the $230 from the $450: 
$450 - $230 = $220

"Let's figure out how many apple slices are left.

First, we need to find out how many slices Adam has in total. He has 3 large apples and 5 small apples. 

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so 3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, let's add the slices together: 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so we need to subtract 15 from 30 to find out how many slices are left: 30 - 15 = 15.

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to know how much milk one cow produces. The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow. 

If the farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to divide 25 by 5 to find out how many cows are needed.

25 ÷ 5 = 5

So, the farmer needs 5 cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs.

5 (total cows needed) - 3 (cows already have) = 2

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to figure out how much of each one is left. 

The first glue stick has 1/6 left. To find 1/6 of 12 millimeters, we can multiply 12 by 1/6. That's the same as dividing 12 by 6. 12 divided by 6 is 2. So, the first glue stick has 2 millimeters left.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left. To find 2/3 of 12 millimeters, we can multiply 12 by 2 and then divide by 3. 12 multiplied by 2 is 24, and 24 divided by 3 is 8. So, the second glue stick has 8 millimeters left.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left. To find 1/2 of 12 millimeters, we can divide 12 by 2. 12 divided by 2 is 6. So, the third glue stick has 6 millimeters left.

Now, we add the unused portions together: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800. He already has $5,000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help him. 

First, we need to find out how much money Gabriel has in total. He has $5,000 from working and $200 from his brother, so we add those two numbers together: $5,000 + $200 = $5,200.

Now, we need to find out how much money Gabriel needs to buy the car and the phone. The car costs $10,000 and the phone costs $800, so we add those two numbers together: $10,000 + $800 = $10,800.

To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we subtract the amount of money he has from the total cost of the items: $10,800 - $5,200 = $4,600.

So, Gabriel still needs $4,600."
"So, Thea bought a hat for $70. She paid with four $20 bills. To find out how much change she got, we need to subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount she gave the craftsman.

He buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he must have collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Now, Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we need to add the number of socks and dishes that Jack and Peter have. 

Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes, so he has 30 + 60 = 90 items in total.
Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes, so he has 60 + 30 = 90 items in total.

Now, let's add the total number of items that Jack and Peter have together: 90 + 90 = 180.

"Let's figure this out. We know there are 20 students in the class. Some of them are good at math, some are good at English, and some are good at both.

We know 5 students are good at math only. That means they don't know English. And 8 students are good at English only. That means they don't know math.

If we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at English only, we get 5 + 8 = 13. But we know there are 20 students in total. So, the students who are good at both math and English must be 20 - 13 = 7.

Now, we need to find out how many students are good at math. We already know 5 students are good at math only. And we know 7 students are good at both math and English. So, if we add those two numbers together, we get 5 + 7 = 12.

"So, Vicki is putting on a concert at her high school. The concert is going to be 2 hours long. Each group gets 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to get off the stage. There's also a 10-minute break in the middle.

First, let's figure out how long each group takes. They get on stage for 2 minutes, perform for 6 minutes, and then get off for 2 minutes. That's 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes for each group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. But we have to subtract the 10-minute break, so we have 120 - 10 = 110 minutes left for the groups to perform.

Now, let's divide the total time available for performances (110 minutes) by the time each group takes (10 minutes). 110 / 10 = 11.

So, the answer is 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"Let's figure out how much money Brenda will have after 3 years.

Brenda starts with $300. Each year, she earns 3/4 of that amount as interest. So, the first year she earns $300 * 3/4 = $225. Now she has $300 + $225 = $525.

The next year, she earns $525 * 3/4 = $393.75. Now she has $525 + $393.75 = $918.75.

The next year, she earns $918.75 * 3/4 = $345.5625. Now she has $918.75 + $345.5625 = $264.5625.

The final answer is: $964.5625"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we have 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. We know that half of the white shirts have collars. So, we need to find half of 40, which is 20. This means 20 white shirts have collars.

Now, we need to find out how many white shirts don't have collars. We can do this by subtracting the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts. So, 40 - 20 = 20. This means 20 white shirts don't have collars.

Next, we know that 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find out how many floral shirts don't have buttons, we need to subtract 20 from the total number of floral shirts. So, 50 - 20 = 30. This means 30 floral shirts don't have buttons.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. We can do this by subtracting the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons. So, 30 - 20 = 10.

"Let's figure out how much the farmer will earn from selling the eggs.

First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer has. Since each tray holds 30 eggs and the farmer has 900 eggs, we can divide 900 by 30 to find the number of trays.

900 ÷ 30 = 30

Now that we know the farmer has 30 trays, we need to find out how much money he will get for each tray. The farmer sells each tray for $2.5.

To find the total amount of money the farmer will get, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

30 * $2.5 = $75

First, we need to find out how many goats are left in Farm X. Mr. Smith started with 55 goats and sold 10. To find the number of goats left, we subtract 10 from 55.
55 - 10 = 45

Now, let's find out how many goats are left in Farm Y. Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we subtract 20 from 45 (the initial number of goats in Farm Y).
45 - 20 = 25

Now, we need to find the total number of goats left in both farms. We add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y.
45 + 25 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to know how many pairs he buys in a year and how much he spends in total.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, let's find out how much he spends on shoes in total. He spends $2640 on shoes each year.

To find the average cost of each pair, we need to divide the total amount he spends ($2640) by the number of pairs he buys (24).

$2640 ÷ 24 = $110

The final answer is: $110"
"Let's figure this out. We have two kinds of baskets: green and red. The green basket costs $25 and the red basket costs $18. We want to buy 3 of each kind.

First, let's find out how much 3 green baskets cost: 3 x $25 = $75. That's the cost of the green baskets.

Now, let's find out how much 3 red baskets cost: 3 x $18 = $54. That's the cost of the red baskets.

Now, we add the cost of the green baskets and the red baskets together: $75 + $54 = $129. This is how much we would pay if we didn't get any discount.

But, we get a discount on the red baskets. We get $2 off for each red basket. So, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $129 - $6 (3 x $2) = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find out how long it takes to clean half of the rooms, we need to know how many rooms that is. Since there are 90 rooms, half of that would be 45 rooms.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to clean 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we multiply 45 by 20.

45 * 20 = 900 minutes

To make it easier to understand, we can convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 900 by 60.

900 / 60 = 15 hours

So, it would take 15 hours to clean half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. First, we need to find the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, we double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's say my age is x. My brother is 3 years older than me, so his age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

Since age cannot be a decimal, we need to try another approach.

Let's try to find a whole number solution. We can start by trying x = 8.

If x = 8, then my brother's age is 8 + 3 = 11, my sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6, and my mom's age is 3(11) - 1 = 32.

The sum of our ages is 8 + 11 + 6 + 32 = 57, which is less than 87.

Let's try x = 9.

If x = 9, then my brother's age is 9 + 3 = 12, my sister's age is 9 - 2 = 7, and my mom's age is 3(12) - 1 = 35.

The sum of our ages is 9 + 12 + 7 + 35 = 63, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 10.

If x = 10, then my brother's age is 10 + 3 = 13, my sister's age is 10 - 2 = 8, and my mom's age is 3(13) - 1 = 38.

The sum of our ages is 10 + 13 + 8 + 38 = 69, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 11.

If x = 11, then my brother's age is 11 + 3 = 14, my sister's age is 11 - 2 = 9, and my mom's age is 3(14) - 1 = 41.

The sum of our ages is 11 + 14 + 9 + 41 = 75, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 12.

If x = 12, then my brother's age is 12 + 3 = 15, my sister's age is 12 - 2 = 10, and my mom's age is 3(15) - 1 = 44.

The sum of our ages is 12 + 15 + 10 + 44 = 81, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 13.

If x = 13, then my brother's age is 13 + 3 = 16, my sister's age is 13 - 2 = 11, and my mom's age is 3(16) - 1 = 47.

The sum of our ages is 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.

So, the correct answer is x = 13.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to know how many glue sticks he needs in total and how many glue sticks are in each pack.

There are 27 students in Mr. Jackson's class, and he wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. So, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks per student: 27 * 2 = 54.

Now, we need to know how many glue sticks are in each pack. The packs come with 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 / 8 = 6.75.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"So, let's say there's a river and the amount of water going through it at one point is 4000 gallons. Then, after a big rain, the amount of water going through the river doubles to 8000 gallons. 

Now, on the third day, the amount of water going through the river increases by 6000 gallons. To find the new total, we need to add 6000 gallons to 8000 gallons. 

8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

So, the total amount of water going through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

The final answer is: 14000"
"Let's figure out how many people are infected after three days.

We start with 10 people who are infected. Each of these people infects 6 others every day. So, on the first day, 10 * 6 = 60 new people get infected. Now we have 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70 people infected.

On the second day, the 60 people who got infected on the first day infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people. The 10 people who were initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people. So, we add 360 + 60 = 420 new people to the 70 people who were already infected. Now we have 70 + 420 = 490 people infected.

On the third day, the 360 people who got infected on the second day infect 360 * 6 = 2160 new people. The 60 people who got infected on the first day infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people. The 10 people who were initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people. So, we add 2160 + 360 + 60 = 2580 new people to the 490 people who were already infected. Now we have 490 + 2580 = 3070 people infected.

The final answer is: 3070"
"Let's figure out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether.

Rafaela got tips from 40 customers, and each customer gave her $20. So, we multiply 40 by 20 to find out how much money Rafaela got in tips.

40 * 20 = 800

Now, we need to find out how much money Julieta got in tips. We know that Julieta got 10% less money than Rafaela. To find 10% of 800, we multiply 800 by 0.1.

0.1 * 800 = 80

Now, we subtract 80 from 800 to find out how much money Julieta got in tips.

800 - 80 = 720

So, Julieta got $720 in tips. To find the total amount of money they received as tips, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together.

800 + 720 = 1520

The final answer is: $1520"
"Let's figure out how many oranges Jennifer has left. 

Jennifer gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each. That's 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. 

Then, she gave her son 3 oranges. So, in total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges from the market. To find out how many she has left, we need to subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought. 

12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's figure this out. 

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, so she earns half a badge every month. Wendy earns three times as many badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 badges every month.

If we multiply the number of badges each person earns per month by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year), we get:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 0.5 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

Now, let's find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year. We subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's figure out how much money Paige raised for her fundraiser.

Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves every hour. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. So, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. To find out how much money she made, we need to multiply the number of slices by the price per slice. But first, we need to convert the price per slice to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 50 cents is equal to 0.5 dollars.

Now, let's multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * 0.5 dollars/slice = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Gretchen has 70 gold coins. We also know that she has 30 more silver coins than gold coins. 

To find out how many silver coins she has, we need to add 30 to the number of gold coins. So, 70 + 30 = 100. This means Gretchen has 100 silver coins.

Now, to find the total number of coins, we need to add the number of silver coins and gold coins together. 100 + 70 = 170.

The final answer is: 170"
"So, let's figure out how many burritos are left over from the picnic. There were 600 burritos in total. 

First, we need to find out how many burritos the students ate. There were 50 students, and each student got 10 burritos. To find the total number of burritos the students ate, we multiply 50 by 10. That's 50 * 10 = 500.

Now, Mr. George ate 20 burritos. So, we need to add those to the total number of burritos the students ate. 500 + 20 = 520.

Now, we need to find out how many burritos are left over. We do this by subtracting the total number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos. So, 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's figure out how many yellow cars the bumper car rink has. 

First, we know they have 12 red cars. Then, they have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

Next, they have 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we add up the number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, we need to find out how many yellow cars they have. To do that, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have a total of 85 books together. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's say Fawn has F books. Then Anne has F - 12 books, and Sofie has F - 12 + 25 books, which is F + 13 books.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of books: F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we need to figure out how much the sweet potatoes weighed first. We know the potatoes weighed 5 pounds, and the sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. So, we multiply 5 by 2 to get the weight of the sweet potatoes.

5 x 2 = 10

Now that we know the sweet potatoes weighed 10 pounds, we need to find out how much the carrots weighed. We know the carrots weighed 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes. So, we subtract 3 from 10.

10 - 3 = 7

Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we need to know how many Jello cups he needs. Since there will be 30 kids at the party and each kid will get 4 Jello cups, we multiply 30 by 4 to get the total number of Jello cups needed. 

30 * 4 = 120

Now, we need to know how many boxes of Jello Greg needs to buy. Since one box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, we divide 120 by 10 to find out how many boxes he needs.

120 / 10 = 12

Each box of Jello costs $1.25, so we multiply 12 by $1.25 to find the total cost.

12 * $1.25 = $15

So, Greg will spend $15 on Jello.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's figure this out. The seller bought 5 phones for $700 each. To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of phones by the price of each phone. 

5 phones * $700 = $3500

Now, the seller gives the seller $4000 in dollar bills. To find the change, we need to subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given. 

$4000 - $3500 = $500

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"Let's figure out how much Keenan spends on groceries per week. 

First, we need to find out how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

To find 40% of $400, we multiply 0.4 by 400. 

0.4 x 400 = 160

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so we divide the amount Keenan spends in a month by 4.

160 / 4 = 40

So, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries."
"To find out how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To do this, we multiply 2/5 by 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To do this, we multiply 7/13 by 26. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day: 
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find out how much 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water will cost, we need to know how much one bottle of soda and one bottle of water cost.

Let's start with the soda. If 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, then we can divide $21.00 by 7 to find the cost of one bottle of soda. $21.00 ÷ 7 = $3.00. So, one bottle of soda costs $3.00.

Now, let's find the cost of one bottle of water. If 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, then we can divide $8.00 by 4 to find the cost of one bottle of water. $8.00 ÷ 4 = $2.00. So, one bottle of water costs $2.00.

Now that we know the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. 

3 bottles of soda will cost 3 x $3.00 = $9.00.
2 bottles of water will cost 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.
The total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The final answer is: $13.00"
"Let's figure out how much money David has left after buying the bolts.

First, we need to know how much the bolts cost. There are 16 bolts and each one costs $0.03. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bolts by the cost per bolt:

16 bolts * $0.03 per bolt = $0.48

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the bolts from the money David has. He has $12.48. So, we subtract $0.48 from $12.48:

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, David has $12.00 left after buying the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after walking dogs for 12 hours, we need to know how much she earns per hour. 

We know that she earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. To find out her hourly rate, we can divide the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3).

$33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour.

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate ($11) by the number of hours she will work (12) to find out how much she will earn.

$11 per hour * 12 hours = $132.

The final answer is: $132"
"Let's figure out how many marbles Paul has left.

First, Paul starts with 52 marbles. Then, his friend gives him 28 more marbles. So, now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Next, Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we can divide 80 by 4. 80 ÷ 4 = 20. This means Paul lost 20 marbles.

Now, we need to subtract the marbles he lost from the total marbles he had: 80 - 20 = 60.

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"Let's figure out how many points Amy gets on her history test.

First, we need to find out how many points she gets from the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 of them, and she gets 80% of them right. To find 80% of 10, we multiply 10 by 0.8. That's 10 x 0.8 = 8 points.

Next, we need to find out how many points she gets from the true/false questions. There are 20 of them, and she gets 90% of them right. To find 90% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.9. That's 20 x 0.9 = 18 points.

Now, let's look at the long-answer questions. There are 5 of them, and she gets 60% of them right. To find 60% of 5, we multiply 5 by 0.6. That's 5 x 0.6 = 3 points. But each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so we multiply 3 by 5. That's 3 x 5 = 15 points.

Now, we add up all the points: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41.

The final answer is: 41"
"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to know how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Now, we know he's selling 180 chickens at $50 each. To find the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken:

180 * $50 = $9000

But we're told he needs to make a profit of $2000. So, the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, we need to find the cost price of the chickens. To do this, we subtract the profit from the selling price:

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

The final answer is: $7000"
"Let's figure out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold. Since they sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2.

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Now, we know that Julie sold 14 glasses. To find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah, we need to subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

So, Julie sold 2 glasses fewer than Micah.

"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to figure out how much she spent on each thing. 

First, she spent $400 on her hair. 

Then, she spent 1/4 of that on her manicure. To find 1/4 of $400, we need to divide 400 by 4. 400 divided by 4 is 100. So, she spent $100 on her manicure.

Next, she spent 3/4 of what she spent on her manicure on her pedicure. To find 3/4 of $100, we need to multiply 100 by 3 and then divide by 4. 100 multiplied by 3 is 300, and 300 divided by 4 is 75. So, she spent $75 on her pedicure.

Now, let's add up how much she spent on each thing: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"Let's figure out how much money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope.

First, we need to find out how much money Sarah will get from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is buying it for $2 a meter. So, we multiply 20 by 2 to find the total amount of money she gets:

20 x 2 = 40

Now, we need to find out how much the new rope costs. The new rope is also 20 meters long, but it costs $1.5 a meter. So, we multiply 20 by 1.5 to find the total cost of the new rope:

20 x 1.5 = 30

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the rope:

40 - 30 = 10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after she buys the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years. That means right now, she is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

We want to know when her age will be three times her current age. Let's call the number of years it takes for this to happen 'x'. At that time, her age will be 8 + x.

Since her age will be three times her current age, we can write an equation: 8 + x = 24.

To find 'x', we need to get it by itself. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation. So, x = 24 - 8.

x = 16

So, Melanie's age will be three times her current age in 16 years."
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the bacon. Kelly bought 5 packs of bacon for $10.

Next, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and Kelly bought 6 packs of chicken. So, the cost of the chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120.

Now, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Kelly bought 3 packs of strawberries for $4 each, so the cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Finally, we need to find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, and Kelly bought 7 packs of apples. So, the cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

Since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91."
"So, Elaina is having her last concert and it's going to be super long. She makes it twice as long as her usual concerts. Then, she does a 15-minute encore at the end. The whole thing lasts 65 minutes. We need to figure out how long her usual concerts are.

Let's call the length of her usual concert ""x"" minutes. Since the final concert is twice as long, it's 2x minutes. And we know the encore is 15 minutes. So, the total length of the concert is 2x + 15 minutes.

We know the total length is 65 minutes, so we can set up an equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the 15 on the left side. We can do that by subtracting 15 from both sides: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Now, we need to get x by itself. We can do that by dividing both sides by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

So, Elaina's usual concerts are 25 minutes long.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's figure out how many toys Argo has now. He started with 200 toys. He gave some to his friends. He gave 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky.

First, we need to add up how many toys he gave away. 40 + 80 is 120, and then we add 30 to that, which is 150. So, he gave away a total of 150 toys.

Now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the number of toys he started with. 200 - 150 is 50.

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then multiply the number made on Friday by 2.

First, we add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday: 125 + 125 = 250
Then, we multiply the number made on Friday by 2: 2 * 125 = 250
Now, we add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday to the number made on Friday: 250 + 250 = 500

The final answer is: 500"
"Let's say the singer has 50 microphones and he wants to put them in pairs. But 20% of the microphones won't fit. That means 80% of the microphones will fit.

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8. 

50 * 0.8 = 40

Since each pair has 2 microphones, we need to divide 40 by 2 to find the number of pairs.

40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's count the birds. Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes. Then, he sees 2/3 of that number flying overhead. To find 2/3 of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

6 * 2 = 12
12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 birds flying overhead. Now, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each eating. To find the total number of birds eating, we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24

Now, let's add up all the birds: 6 (in the bushes) + 4 (flying) + 24 (eating) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's figure this out. Lani baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 of them, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

55 - 5 = 50

Now, we know she put the rest of the cookies into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we need to divide the total cookies left by the number of jars.

50 ÷ 5 = 10

So, there are 10 cookies in each jar.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's count the petals. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, let's count the petals on the daisies. Joelle has 4 daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is 4 x 10 = 40.

To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to subtract the number of petals on the orchids from the number of petals on the daisies. That's 40 - 25 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's figure out what percent of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.

First, we need to find out how many of her plants are indoor plants. Since one-fourth of her plants are indoor plants, we multiply 100 by 1/4. That's 25 indoor plants.

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left. We subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants: 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we multiply 75 by 2/3. That's 50 outdoor plants.

Now, we need to find out how many plants are flowering plants. We subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants: 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to know how fast a whatchamacallit and a thingamabob spin. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. 

First, let's find out how fast a thingamabob spins. If a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. We know that a whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob. 

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's figure out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day.

Ellen eats 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

We know that the total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11. We can make an equation to solve for the cost of one carrot. Let's call the cost of one carrot 'x'. Then, the cost of 2 carrots is 2x.

The total cost equation is: 2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"Let's figure out how much Mark makes a week. 

Mark works 8 hours a day, and he works 5 days a week. So, we need to multiply 8 hours by 5 days to find out how many hours he works in a week. 

8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay got raised by $2. So, now he makes $10 + $2 = $12 an hour.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's figure out how much Tasha made from selling lemonade.

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We also know that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. 

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. So, in total, she mowed lawns x + 3x + 5x = 9x times.

Since she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can try different values of x to find y. If x = 1, then 54x = 54 and y = 80 - 54 = 26.

So, Tasha made $26 from selling lemonade.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to find Christian's weight first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Now, we need to find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Finally, we need to find Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"Let's figure out how much profit John makes from renting his car.

John rents his car 10 times a month. Each time, he rents it for 3 hours. He gets paid $25 for every hour he rents his car.

To find out how much money John makes in total, we need to multiply the number of times he rents his car by the number of hours and his hourly rate.

10 (times rented) * 3 (hours per rental) * $25 (hourly rate) = $750

Now, we need to subtract the car payment from the total amount he makes. His car payment is $500.

$750 (total earnings) - $500 (car payment) = $250

So, John makes a profit of $250 from renting his car.

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's figure out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph.

We know that Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now she has a total of 7 notebooks. To find out how many notebooks she had before, we need to subtract the 5 notebooks she bought from the 7 she has now. 7 - 5 = 2. So, Martha had 2 notebooks before.

Since Joseph has 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha had 2 notebooks, Joseph must have 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: 1"
"So, Dijana and Anis went rowing on the lake. Dijana rowed 50 miles the whole day. Anis rowed 1/5 more miles than Dijana. 

To find out how many miles Anis rowed, we need to multiply 50 by 1/5. Multiplying by a fraction is the same as dividing by its reciprocal. So, we divide 50 by 5. 

50 divided by 5 is 10. 

So, Anis rowed 10 more miles than Dijana. To find the total miles Anis rowed, we add 10 to 50. 

50 + 10 is 60. 

Now, we need to find the total miles both Dijana and Anis rowed. We add the miles they each rowed. 

50 + 60 is 110.

The final answer is: 110"
"Let's figure out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get. 

First, we need to know how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took some. Susan started with 100 cookies, and her husband took 4. To find out how many cookies are left, we subtract 4 from 100.

100 - 4 = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. To do this, we can use division.

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

"Let's figure out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages. Daniel read a total of 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read. That's 28 - 13 = 15.

"Let's figure out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch.

Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. He and his wife are adults, so that's 2 adult bowls. They have 2 kids, so that's 2 child bowls. 

In total, 4 bowls were used for dinner. Since the pot can fill 8 child bowls, that means there are 8 - 4 = 4 child bowls left.

There are 2 kids, and each kid can have a bowl of soup for lunch. So, we need to divide the leftover child bowls by the number of kids. 4 / 2 = 2.

So, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to figure out how much material is needed for small masks and large masks separately, and then add them together.

First, let's find out how much material is needed for the small masks. We know that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks. So, to find out how much material is needed for one small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4 masks. That's 0.5 yards per small mask.

Now, we need to find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks. We multiply 0.5 yards per small mask by 20 small masks. That's 10 yards.

Next, let's find out how much material is needed for the large masks. We know that 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks. So, to find out how much material is needed for one large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks. That's 0.75 yards per large mask.

Now, we need to find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks. We multiply 0.75 yards per large mask by 8 large masks. That's 6 yards.

To find the total amount of material needed, we add the material needed for small masks and large masks together. That's 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to know how many hours he has in a day and how many hours he uses for sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. Harold sleeps for 10 hours, which means he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left. But he also works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours. And he walks his dog for 1 hour.

So, Harold uses 10 hours for sleeping, 8 hours for working, and 1 hour for walking his dog. That's a total of 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.

Now, let's subtract the hours he uses from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out Adam's age four years ago. We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Let's call Adam's age four years ago 'x'. 

So, eight years ago, Duncan's age was 60 - 8 = 52. This is equal to two times Adam's age four years ago, which is 2x. 

Now, we can write the equation: 52 = 2x. To find 'x', we need to divide both sides by 2. 

52 / 2 = x
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to 26.

"Let's count Larry's pets. He has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.

Now, let's count the rabbits. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Next, we need to count the fish. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.

Then, we have the gerbils. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

"Lana has 27 cups of tea. She puts them into 3 rows, and in each row, she makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea. Then, she uses the remaining cups to make 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

First, we need to find out how many cups of tea are in each row. We can do this by dividing 27 by 3. 

27 / 3 = 9

So, there are 9 cups in each row. Since she makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, there are 9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row. But we can't have half a cup of tea, so we need to choose between 4 or 5 cups of mint tea.

If there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row, then there would be 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row. This would mean there are 3 * 4 = 12 cups of mint tea in total.

If there are 5 cups of mint tea in each row, then there would be 4 cups of chamomile tea in each row. This would mean there are 3 * 5 = 15 cups of mint tea in total.

Since we know there are 15 cups of mint tea in total, the correct answer is 5 cups of mint tea in each row.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much water is in the tank. Since Anthony and his dad fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, and there are 10000 gallons of water in the pool, we need to divide 10000 by 2. 

10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons

So, there are 5000 gallons of water in the tank.

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the total amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

Now, we need to find out how much water is left in the tank. To do this, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

- 2 tubs of popcorn that cost $8 each: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy that cost $2 each: 4 * $2 = $8

He spent a total of $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Now, let's subtract the money he spent from his total: $150 - $130 = $20.

Colby wants to see a movie on a Friday, and tickets for Fridays cost $10. He can use his remaining money to see one more movie on a Friday. That leaves him with $20 - $10 = $10.

Tickets for other days cost $7. With $10, he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (but you can't see a fraction of a movie, so let's round down to 1) more movie on other days.

So, Colby can see a total of 1 movie on a Friday and 1 movie on another day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's figure out how many calories Andrew's pastries have. 

First, we need to find out how many calories are in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since the mini pastries have 1/3 of the calories of the normal ones, we need to divide the calories of the normal pastries by 3.

A mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 
A mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many calories are in all the mini pastries. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. 
He also baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

To find the total calories of all the pastries, we add the calories from the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to add up all the Junebugs she removed and then divide by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs. 
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up all the Junebugs: 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days: 378 / 5 = 75.6

The average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 75.6."
"To find out how far the bus and the car traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so it traveled 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so it traveled 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

Now, we need to find out how much farther the bus went than the car. To do this, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls Sophie bought, we need to know how many toys she had before she bought them and how many she had after. We know she had 31 blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 rings. So, let's add those up.

31 + 8 + 9 = 48

This is how many toys she had before she bought the bouncy balls. We know she had 62 toys after buying the bouncy balls. To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we need to subtract the number of toys she had before from the number of toys she had after.

62 - 48 = 14

So, Sophie bought 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Peter, Paul, and Jean's ages add up to 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Let's call Peter's age ""P"", Paul's age ""Pp"", and Jean's age ""J"".

We can write an equation using the information that Peter, Paul, and Jean's ages add up to 100:
P + Pp + J = 100

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can write another equation:
Pp = J + 10

We also know that Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages, so we can write another equation:
P = Pp + J

Now, let's use the second equation to substitute Pp in the first equation:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, let's use the third equation to substitute P in the equation:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100

We can substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100

Combine like terms:
3J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
3J = 80

Divide both sides by 3:
J = 80/3
J = 26.67

Now that we have Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 26.67 + 10
Pp = 36.67

Now that we have Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = Pp + J
P = 36.67 + 26.67
P = 63.34

The final answer is: 63.34"
"So, Maria invited 4 friends over for a water balloon fight. She gave each of them 2 water balloons, and she had 1 for herself. That's a total of 1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15 balloons.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons.

The final answer is: 24"
"So, a charity group is having a yard sale. They got 10 people who donated 5 boxes of stuff each, which is 10 x 5 = 50 boxes. They already had 10 boxes, so they have a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Now, they can put 2 boxes on each table. To find out how many tables they need, we divide the total number of boxes by 2. 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to add up the total distance spat by each person and then divide by the total number of seeds.

Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, her total distance is 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, her total distance is 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

Now, we add up their total distances: 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

Next, we need to know how many seeds they spat in total. Zoey spat 40 seeds and Sydney spat 35 seeds, so together they spat 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

To find the average distance, we divide the total distance by the total number of seeds: 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

The final answer is: 10.93"
"Let's figure out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000.

First, we need to find out how many widgets each machine can make in a month. We know that the Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. There are 24 hours in a day and 30 days in a month.

So, let's multiply the number of widgets each machine makes per hour by the number of hours in a day and the number of days in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's find out how much money each machine will make. Each widget sells for $6.

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we need to subtract the money made from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the money made from the Widgeteer 3000:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"Let's figure out how much money Cameron would save.

Cameron stays at the hotel from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning. That's a total of 17 hours. 

The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. But Cameron wants to pay for a 12-hour stay and add extra for the extra hours. The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos, and for every extra hour, he has to pay 70 pesos.

Cameron stays for 5 extra hours, so he has to pay 70 * 5 = 350 pesos extra.

To find the total cost of the 12-hour stay plus the extra hours, we add 1000 and 350, which is 1350 pesos.

Now, let's compare this to the 24-hour stay. The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos. To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay plus the extra hours from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

So, Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we need to know how much each goat and each sheep needs. 

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. To find out how much a sheep needs, we need to know that it needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount a goat needs. Twice the amount a goat needs is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 3 pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how much hay all the goats and sheep need. There are 15 goats, so 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay for the goats. There are 12 sheep, so 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay for the sheep.

To find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"Let's figure out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy.

First, we need to find out how much money John made. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours. So, he made 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

Next, John spent 50 dollars on gas and 100 dollars to deposit in the bank. That's a total of 50 + 100 = 150 dollars spent.

Now, let's subtract the money he spent from the money he made: 300 - 150 = 150 dollars.

John also wants to buy 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each. So, he'll spend 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils.

Now, let's subtract the cost of pencils from the money he has: 150 - 50 = 100 dollars.

Finally, let's find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money: 100 / 25 = 4.

"Let's figure this out. Craig spelled 20 words, and each word had 15 letters. To find the total number of letters he used, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Now, Craig's brother used 50 more letters than Craig. So, we add 50 to the number of letters Craig used: 300 + 50 = 350.

To find the total number of letters they both used, we add the number of letters Craig used to the number of letters his brother used: 300 + 350 = 650.

"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows and then multiply the result by the number of schools.

There are 8 children in each row. There are 7 rows in total. There are 5 different schools.

So, we multiply 8 by 7 to get the number of children in all the rows, and then we multiply that result by 5 to get the total number of children.

8 * 7 = 56
56 * 5 = 280

The final answer is: 280"
"Let's figure this out. There are 29 students in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. To find out how many bottles the students get in total, we multiply the number of students by the number of bottles each student gets: 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be used to get 100 bottles of apple juice. To find out how many bottles the teacher gets in total, we multiply the number of coupons by the number of bottles each coupon gets: 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, we need to find out how many bottles the teacher has left after giving the students their apple juice. To do this, we subtract the number of bottles the students got from the total number of bottles the teacher got: 900 - 58 = 842.

The final answer is: 842"
"To find out how much Patty charged, we need to add up the cost of the visit, the cost of the parts, and the labor cost.

First, let's find the labor cost. Patty worked for 2.25 hours, and she charges $35 per hour. So, we multiply 2.25 hours by $35 per hour.

2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

Now, we need to add the cost of the parts, which is $60, and the visit fee, which is $40.

$78.75 (labor) + $60 (parts) + $40 (visit) = $178.75

So, Patty charged a total of $178.75.

The final answer is: $178.75"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, James bought 10 CDs for $15 each. So, the total cost of the CDs is 10 x $15 = $150.

Then, he got a 40% discount on the CDs. To find 40% of $150, we multiply $150 by 0.4. That's 0.4 x $150 = $60. So, the discount is $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $150 - $60 = $90. This is how much James paid for the CDs.

Next, James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. So, he made 5 x $40 = $200 from selling the CDs.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the money he made from the money he paid. That's $200 - $90 = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find out how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of crop and then add them together.

First, let's find out how much she'll earn from the yams. She has 6 yams and each one sells for $1.5. So, 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we'll find out how much she'll earn from the sweet potatoes. She has 10 sweet potatoes and each one sells for $2. So, 10 * $2 = $20.

Lastly, we'll find out how much she'll earn from the carrots. She has 4 carrots and each one sells for $1.25. So, 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"Let's figure out how long it took James to swim across the lake.

First, we need to find out how far James swam before he rested. 60% of 20 miles is the same as 0.6 x 20, which is 12 miles. So James swam 12 miles.

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, we can find out how long it took him to swim 12 miles by dividing 12 by 2. That's 6 hours.

After swimming, James rested for half as long as he swam, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles left to swim. But he swims at half the speed now, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. So it will take him 8 hours to swim the remaining 8 miles.

To find the total time, we add up the time it took James to swim, rest, and swim the remaining distance: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to multiply the number of loaves Sam had by 7. Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

7 * 70 = 490

Now, we need to subtract 40 from 490 because the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had. 

490 - 40 = 450

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"Let's figure out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end.

Jasmine got 15 stickers for participating in class. Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. To find out how many stickers she has left, we need to subtract 7 from 15.

"To find out how much commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the commission from the New York Times. 
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times for $5 each.
- He gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- To find the commission, we multiply the number of copies sold by the price per copy and the commission rate, and then divide by 100.
- Commission from New York Times = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
- Commission from New York Times = 300 / 100
- Commission from New York Times = $3

Next, let's find the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal for $15 each.
- He gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Commission from Wall Street Journal = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
- Commission from Wall Street Journal = 1200 / 100
- Commission from Wall Street Journal = $12

Now, let's add the commission from both newspapers to find the total commission.
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3 + $12
- Total commission = $15

"Let's figure out how old Leo is. We know Deanna is 26 years old. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we need to subtract 5 from 26 to find Marcus's age. 

26 - 5 = 21

Now, we know Marcus is 21 years old. We also know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. To find Leo's age, we need to multiply Marcus's age by 2.

21 * 2 = 42

So, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. 

Let's say Azibo scored A points. Then, Bahati scored A + 20 points, and Dinar scored A - 10 points (since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar).

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can write the equation: A + (A + 20) + (A - 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 10 = 45.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 3A = 35.

Divide both sides by 3: A = 35 / 3.

A = 11.67 (but we can't have a fraction of a point, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number).

However, since we can't have a fraction of a point, we need to re-examine our equation. Let's try A = 11.

If A = 11, then Bahati scored 11 + 20 = 31 points, and Dinar scored 11 - 10 = 1 point.

Now, let's check if the total points add up to 45: 11 + 31 + 1 = 43 (not 45).

Let's try A = 12.

If A = 12, then Bahati scored 12 + 20 = 32 points, and Dinar scored 12 - 10 = 2 points.

Now, let's check if the total points add up to 45: 12 + 32 + 2 = 46 (not 45).

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to know how many pages are in each inch and how thick the book is.

Each inch has 100 pages, but since each page is printed on both sides, we multiply 100 by 2 to get 200 pages per inch.

Now, we need to know how thick the book is. The book is 1.5 inches thick. To find the total number of pages, we multiply 200 pages per inch by 1.5 inches.

200 * 1.5 = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"Let's figure out how many reports Vince stapled. He stapled reports for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes:
3 * 60 = 180 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 15:
180 / 15 = 12

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 12 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 * 12 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to know how long she usually sleeps and how long she was awake during the night.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. That's 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

But she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m.

We need to find out how long she was awake before she started sleepwalking. She started sleepwalking at 2:15 a.m. So, we need to find out how long it was from 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m.

From 10 p.m. to 12 a.m. is 2 hours, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. From 12 a.m. to 2 a.m. is 2 hours, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. And from 2 a.m. to 2:15 a.m. is 15 minutes.

So, she was awake for 120 + 120 + 15 = 255 minutes before she started sleepwalking.

We know she was sleepwalking for 23 minutes. To find out how long she slept, we need to subtract the time she was awake and the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time. 

Her total sleep time is 480 minutes. She was awake for 255 minutes and sleepwalking for 23 minutes. So, she slept for 480 - 255 - 23 = 202 minutes.

The final answer is: 202"
"Let's figure this out step by step. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups. We know that a dozen is 12, so two dozen is 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know he has 2/3 as many spoons as cups. To find 2/3 of 24, we can multiply 24 by 2 and then divide by 3.

24 x 2 = 48
48 ÷ 3 = 16

So Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons. But then he gives 6 spoons to Pedro. To find out how many spoons he has left, we subtract 6 from 16.

16 - 6 = 10

Now we know Jonathan has 10 spoons left. We also know he has 24 cups. To find the total number of utensils he has, we add the number of cups and spoons together.

24 + 10 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many beds are already occupied in the hospital. The hospital has 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. To find 1/5 of 1000, we can multiply 1000 by 1 and then divide by 5.

1000 * 1 = 1000
1000 ÷ 5 = 200

So, 200 beds are occupied. This means 1000 - 200 = 800 beds are unoccupied.

Now, let's think about the coronavirus outbreak. 50 patients are admitted to the hospital each day. We need to find out how many patients will be admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.

50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we add the 700 patients to the 200 beds that were already occupied.

200 + 700 = 900

Since the hospital has 1000 beds, we need to find out how many beds are left unoccupied.

1000 - 900 = 100

"Let's figure this out step by step. Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of those, 7 are work emails. So, we need to find out how many emails are not work-related. We do that by subtracting the work emails from the total emails: 16 - 7 = 9.

Now, we know that 9 emails are not work-related. Two-thirds of those emails are to her family. To find two-thirds of 9, we multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3: (2 * 9) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. So, 6 emails are to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left that are not to her family. We do that by subtracting the family emails from the non-work emails: 9 - 6 = 3.

Finally, we need to find out how many of those 3 emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is 1. So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"So, let's say Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert. But Kelly said Courtney made a mistake and that the number was actually lower. Kelly said it was 20% lower. 

To find 20% of 48, we multiply 48 by 0.20. That's 48 * 0.20 = 9.6. 

Now, we need to subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the real number of people at the concert. 48 - 9.6 = 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's figure out how many balls the coach brought to practice. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. So, if Jason carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey must have carried half of that, which is 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, then Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, let's add up the number of balls each of them carried: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

So, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

"Let's figure out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day. Then, they dug 13 holes the second day, so they had 10 + 13 = 23 holes. 

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so they had 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

We know that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

"Let's solve the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got the same amount of corn chips, which is 70. Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others. 

If Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, then Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add the number of corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got. 

Total = 70 + 70 + 85
Total = 225

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's say Adelwolfe caught A Pokémon, Stan caught S, and Alex caught L. We know that together they caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can substitute the third equation into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.
9A - 21 = 339.

Now we can add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Now we can divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to figure out how far the bird traveled in total. 

First, the bird flew south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Then, the bird flew north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. We multiply the speed by the time: 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Next, the bird flew south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. We multiply the speed by the time: 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, we add the distances the bird traveled south: 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles.

But wait, the bird also flew 36 miles north. To find the total distance between the two homes, we need to subtract the distance the bird flew north from the total distance the bird flew south: 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"So, Greta wanted brownies for her birthday. She made a batch for herself, which is 1 dozen brownies. That's 12 brownies. Then, her office threw her a party and sent her home with half a dozen brownies. That's 6 brownies. When she got home, her friends had a surprise party for her and they had 4 dozen brownies waiting. That's 48 brownies. 

So, let's add up all the brownies she got: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

But then, some brownies got eaten. They ate 1 and a half dozen brownies. That's 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, let's subtract the brownies that got eaten from the total number of brownies: 66 - 18 = 48.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"Let's figure out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets. 

First, we need to find out how long it takes to string each type of racquet. There are 3 racquets that will be strung with synthetic gut. It takes Andy 15 minutes to string each one of those. So, 3 racquets * 15 minutes = 45 minutes.

Next, there are 5 racquets that will be strung with polyester string. It takes Andy 22 minutes to string each one of those. So, 5 racquets * 22 minutes = 110 minutes.

Then, there are 4 racquets that will be strung with a hybrid set. It takes Andy 18 minutes to string each one of those. So, 4 racquets * 18 minutes = 72 minutes.

Now, we need to add up all the time it takes to string each type of racquet. 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert needs, we need to figure out how much fencing he's going to build. Since it's a rectangular fence, we need to add up all the sides. There are two sides that are 15 feet long and two sides that are 10 feet long.

Let's add up the sides: 
- Two sides are 15 feet long, so that's 2 x 15 = 30 feet
- Two sides are 10 feet long, so that's 2 x 10 = 20 feet
- Now, we add those two numbers together: 30 + 20 = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the total feet of fencing by 2:
50 x 2 = 100

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

"Let's figure out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold.

First, we need to know how many boxes of oranges she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. She bought 12 boxes and gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. So, she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the total number of boxes: 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

Each box has 20 oranges, so we multiply the number of boxes she has left by the number of oranges in each box: 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find 1/4 of 160, we can multiply 160 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing by 4: 160 ÷ 4 = 40 oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many oranges she sold. We know she had 160 oranges and kept 40, so we subtract 40 from 160: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we need to know how much money he still needs to earn. 

First, let's add up the cost of all the books. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

$18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler already has $14 from his allowance, so we need to subtract that from the total cost of the books to find out how much more he needs to earn.

$39 - $14 = $25

Now, we know that Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we can divide the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford his books.

"Let's figure out how much Sunny made from selling gingerbread and apple pie.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. So, on Saturday, he sold 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which is 15 boxes. And he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate how much he made on Saturday. He made 10 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, so that's 10 x 6 = $60. He also made 11 boxes of apple pie at $15 each, so that's 11 x 15 = $165. In total, he made $60 + $165 = $225 on Saturday.

On Sunday, he made 15 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, so that's 15 x 6 = $90. He also made 15 boxes of apple pie at $15 each, so that's 15 x 15 = $225. In total, he made $90 + $225 = $315 on Sunday.

To find out how much he made in total, we add the money he made on Saturday and Sunday. $225 + $315 = $540.

Each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce. So, she'll use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Now, we need to know how many ounces are in each bottle. Each bottle is 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she'll need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she'll use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to figure out what 40% of the blue car's price is, and then subtract that from the blue car's price.

The blue car costs $100. To find 40% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.4 (since 40% is the same as 40/100 or 0.4).

$100 * 0.4 = $40

So, the blue car is $40 cheaper than the red car. To find the price of the red car, we subtract $40 from $100.

$100 - $40 = $60

The red car costs $60.

Now, let's add the prices of both cars together to find the total cost.

$100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

Emil is 19 years old now. We need to find out how old his dad and brother are.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad will be twice as old as Emil at that time. So, if Emil is 24, his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Since Emil is 19 now, we need to find out how old his dad is now. We know his dad will be 48 when Emil is 24, so we need to subtract 5 from 48 to find out his dad's current age. 48 - 5 = 43.

Now, we know Emil's dad is 43 years old. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother will be half of Emil's age at that time. So, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Since Emil is 19 now, we need to subtract 5 from 12 to find out his brother's current age. 12 - 5 = 7.

Now we know Emil's dad is 43 and his brother is 7. To find the sum of their ages, we add 43 + 7 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's figure out how many beads Adrianne has. Her mom gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mom, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mom, so her friend gave her 2 x 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (mom) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's figure out how many servings of crawfish Joe has.

Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday. Then, he caught 4 times that amount on Friday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up all the crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to know how many football players and cheerleaders or band members there are. 

First, we need to find out how many football players there are. 20% of the class are football players. To find 20% of 30, we multiply 0.2 by 30. 0.2 * 30 = 6. So, there are 6 football players.

Now, we need to find out how many students are not football players. There are 30 students in total, and 6 of them are football players. So, 30 - 6 = 24 students are not football players.

Next, we need to find out how many of the non-football players are cheerleaders or band members. 25% of the non-football players are cheerleaders or band members. To find 25% of 24, we multiply 0.25 by 24. 0.25 * 24 = 6. So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early. 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to add their shoe sizes and divide by 2.

Sophie's shoe size is 5. 
Charlie's shoe size is 5 times Sophie's, so it is 5 * 5 = 25.

The sum of their shoe sizes is 5 + 25 = 30.
The average shoe size is 30 / 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract 18 inches from the total length of the flower bed for each plant. We also need to subtract the width of the plant itself (12 inches) from the remaining length.

Let's say Pat has 'n' plants. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1320 - 30n.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers. Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 14 * 6 = $84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to find half of 18. 

Half of 18 is 18 divided by 2, which is 9.

Now, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply 9 by 7.

9 * 7 = 63

The final answer is: 63"
"To find out how much Katherine will spend, we need to figure out how much it costs to fill one basket and then multiply that by 5.

First, let's find the cost of one basket. Katherine wants to put 3 petunias in each basket. Petunias cost $3 each, so 3 petunias will cost 3 x $3 = $9. 

Next, she wants to put 2 sweet potato vines in each basket. Sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each, so 2 vines will cost 2 x $2.50 = $5.

Now, we add the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines together to get the total cost of one basket: $9 + $5 = $14.

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, we multiply the cost of one basket by 5: $14 x 5 = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"Let's figure out how many roses Artemis and her dad can plant. They have a 30-pound bag of soil. 

First, we need to find out how much soil they use for the sunflowers and carnations. They're planting 4 sunflowers, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. So, 4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil.

Next, they're planting 10 carnations, and each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. So, 10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

They have 30 pounds of soil in total, so they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left for the roses.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to know how much money she saves each month and how many months are in a year.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month. She sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply 0.25 by $2,000.00. 

0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month. There are 12 months in a year. To find out how much she saves in a year, we multiply $500.00 by 12.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs she can buy, we divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's figure out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

First, let's think about peeling the shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we need to divide 90 by 6. 90 ÷ 6 is 15. So, it takes her 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.

Now, let's think about cooking the shrimp. Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp, we need to divide 90 by 30. 90 ÷ 30 is 3. This means it takes her 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes to cook 90 shrimp.

Since Emily is doing both peeling and cooking at the same time, we need to find the longer time between the two tasks. Peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The longer time is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, the air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. It warms up by 2 degrees an hour when it's not running.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

Now, let's add those two numbers together: 6 + 12 = 18 degrees. This is how much the air conditioner cooled the room.

But, the room also warmed up by 2 degrees an hour when the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours. So, it warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Now, let's subtract the warming from the cooling: 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Then, Bill saw the comet again when he was three times the age his dad was when he saw the comet. 

Three times 30 is 90, so Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time. 

Since the comet comes around every 75 years, that means 75 years passed between the time Bill's dad saw the comet and the time Bill saw it for the second time. 

To find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill was born, we need to subtract 75 from 90. 90 - 75 is 15. 

So, Bill's dad was 15 years old when Bill was born. 

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when his dad was 30 years old. Since Bill's dad was 15 when Bill was born, we need to add 15 to 30. 30 + 15 is 45. 

But we know that Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, so we need to subtract 15 from 45. 45 - 15 is 30. 

However, that's the age Bill was when his dad saw the comet, not when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet comes around every 75 years, that means 75 years passed between the time Bill saw the comet for the first time and the time his dad saw it. 

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to subtract 75 from 30. 30 - 75 is -45. But you can't be -45 years old, so that's not the right answer.

Let's try again. We know that Bill's dad was 15 when Bill was born, and Bill was 30 when his dad saw the comet. That means 30 - 15 is 15 years passed between Bill's birth and the time his dad saw the comet. 

Since the comet comes around every 75 years, that means 75 - 15 is 60 years passed between the time Bill saw the comet for the first time and the time his dad saw it. 

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to subtract 60 from 30. 30 - 60 is -30. But you can't be -30 years old, so that's not the right answer.

"Let's figure out how many checks Buford writes per year. 

Buford writes a check for his electric bill once a month, so that's 12 checks per year. He also writes a check for his gas bill once a month, which is another 12 checks per year. 

He writes checks to the church twice a month, so that's 2 x 12 = 24 checks per year. 

Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service every 3 months, which is 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up all the checks: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means it flies to Greece for 3/4 of the total flights, and the rest of the flights are split between France and Germany. 

Let's say the total number of flights made by the first plane is x. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

Now, we know that 3/4 of the flights are to Greece, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. This means the remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22. Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's figure out how long the three wolves howl at the moon. 

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. 

Now, we need to find out how long Igneous howls. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. So, we add Tobias and Chikote's howling times together: 20 + 40 = 60 seconds. 

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's figure out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings.

Adam's mom gave him $6 for the new trousers. His dad gave him twice as much as his mom, so his dad gave him 2 x $6 = $12.

To find the total amount of money Adam got from his parents, we add the money his mom and dad gave him. $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, we need to find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings. The trousers cost $30, and he got $18 from his parents. So, he had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that there are four kids: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. The total age of all four kids is 20.

First, let's add up the ages of Akbar and Alessandro: 3 + 4 = 7. This means that the total age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 7 = 13.

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. To find the average age, we need to divide the total age by the number of kids. There are 4 kids, so the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now we know that Helene's age is 10 and the total age of Helene and Wilfred is 13. To find Wilfred's age, we subtract Helene's age from 13: 13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"Walter is collecting money for charity. He gets $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund he set up online. Then, his friend gives him $200. But, his lawyer is going to donate based on the money Walter got from his neighbors and the online fund, not the money from his friend.

So, we need to add the money from the neighbors and the online fund. $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Now, the lawyer is going to donate three times as much as that. To find three times $2000, we multiply $2000 by 3. $2000 * 3 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"So, there was a wedding with 100 guests. Each guest brought 15 cookies. The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you. If each person in the church got 15 cookies, how many people were in the church?

First, we need to find out how many cookies there were in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

100 guests * 15 cookies = 1500 cookies

Now, the bride gave half of the cookies to the church. To find half of 1500, we can divide 1500 by 2.

1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's say the total watermelon is 100 units. We want to divide it among 2 adults and 4 kids. Each adult gets twice as much as each kid.

Let's say each kid gets x units of watermelon. Since each adult gets twice as much as each kid, each adult gets 2x units.

The kids get a total of 4x units (4 kids * x units each). The adults get a total of 2x units (2 adults * 2x units each).

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combine like terms: 6x = 100.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

The final answer is: 33.33"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to know how much time he spends on his rounds and appointments.

First, let's calculate the time he spends on his rounds. He has 9 inpatients and each inpatient takes 20 minutes. So, we multiply 9 by 20 to get the total time spent on rounds: 9 x 20 = 180 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how much time he spends on his appointments. He has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, we multiply 10 by 30 to get the total time spent on appointments: 10 x 30 = 300 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to get the total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 480 minutes to hours. We do this by dividing 480 by 60: 480 ÷ 60 = 8 hours.

Doctor Jones works 9 hours, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours: 9 - 8 = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To figure out when Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time it takes to make the cake. 

First, we have to make the cake batter, which takes 20 minutes. Then we have to bake the cake, which takes 30 minutes. After that, we have to let the cake cool for 2 hours. Finally, we have to frost the cake, which takes 10 minutes.

Let's add up all these times: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 180 ÷ 60 = 3 hours.

So, it takes 3 hours to make the cake. If Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, she should start making the cake 3 hours before that.

If she starts at 2:00 pm, she will have enough time to make the cake and serve it at 5:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's say Lisa and Peter sold a certain number of chocolate bars in boxes. We know that Lisa sold 3 and a half boxes, and Peter sold 4 and a half boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars.

If Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, she sold 3.5 times the number of chocolate bars in a box. If Peter sold 4.5 boxes, he sold 4.5 times the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Let's add the number of chocolate bars they sold together: 3.5 times the number of chocolate bars in a box + 4.5 times the number of chocolate bars in a box = 64.

We can simplify this by adding 3.5 and 4.5, which is 8. So, 8 times the number of chocolate bars in a box = 64.

To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to divide 64 by 8.

64 ÷ 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To find out how much the dance studio makes in a month, we need to know how much they make per session and how many sessions they have in a month.

First, let's figure out how much they make per session. They charge $25 to rent the studio, and $1.50 for each student. They have 10 students, so that's $1.50 * 10 = $15. Adding the $25 to rent, they make $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

Now, we need to know how many sessions they have in a month. They rent the studio 3 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, that's 3 * 4 = 12 sessions in a month.

To find out how much they make in a month, we multiply the amount they make per session by the number of sessions. That's $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's figure this out. We know Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and he has a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box

Now, we know Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and she has a total of 56 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha.

16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many porcupines will be in the park after a year, we need to know how many female porcupines there are and how many babies they will have.

First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are. Since 3/5 of the total population are female, we multiply 50 by 3/5.

50 * 3/5 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines. Each female porcupine has 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 4 by 12 to find out how many babies will be born in a year.

4 * 12 = 48

Now, we add the number of babies born in a year to the initial population of porcupines.

50 + 48 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how much water the pool needs, we need to find the volume of the pool first. The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. To find the volume, we multiply these numbers together.

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find out how many gallons of water the pool needs.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The pool company charges $0.10 per gallon to fill the pool. To find the total cost, we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

"Let's figure out how many sticks they have. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. Then, there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so we add 5 to 9 to get the number of blue sticks: 9 + 5 = 14.

Now, we know there are 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue sticks. To find the number of yellow sticks, we subtract 3 from 14: 14 - 3 = 11.

To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how far each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's speed is 55 miles per hour, and he traveled for 4 hours. So, we multiply 55 by 4 to get his total distance.

55 * 4 = 220 miles

Shandy's speed is 45 miles per hour, and he traveled for 10 hours. So, we multiply 45 by 10 to get his total distance.

45 * 10 = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.

450 - 220 = 230 miles

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know there are 3000 students in total. Half of them are over 16 years old, so that's 3000 / 2 = 1500 students. 

Now, we need to find out how many of those 1500 students are boys. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 are boys, we divide 1500 by 4. That's 1500 / 4 = 375 boys.

So, the number of girls over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Now, let's find out how many students are under 16. That's the other half of the total students, which is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

Half of the students under 16 are boys, so we divide 1500 by 2. That's 1500 / 2 = 750 boys.

Now, we find the number of girls under 16 by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students under 16. That's 1500 - 750 = 750.

Finally, we add the number of girls over 16 and the number of girls under 16 to find the total number of girls. That's 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"Let's figure out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn.

First, we know that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. 

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

"Let's figure out how much water is left in the tank. 

First, we need to find out how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped into the tank on the first day. Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's add up all the water they pumped into the tank: 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank can hold 18000 gallons, we need to subtract the amount of water already in the tank from its capacity to find out how much is left: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Maria's power bank was losing charge, and we need to find out how much charge it had when she went to the park. We are given that after 5 hours, the power bank was losing 9% of its charge each hour. After 5 hours, it had 55% of its charge left.

Then, for the next 3 hours, it was losing 7% of its charge each hour. We know that after 8 hours, it had 28% of its charge left.

Let's think about it this way: if it had 55% of its charge left after 8 hours, and then it lost some more charge to get to 28%, we can figure out how much charge it lost in those last 3 hours. We know it lost 27% of its charge (55% - 28%). Since it was losing 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours, it lost 21% of its charge in those 3 hours (7% * 3).

Now, let's go back to the 55% of charge it had after 5 hours. We know it lost 21% of its charge in those 5 hours. To find out how much charge it had when Maria went to the park, we need to add the 21% it lost back to the 55% it had after 5 hours.

So, the charge it had when Maria went to the park is 55% + 21% = 76%.

"Let's figure out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for a down payment on a car.

Janet makes $10 an hour from her job as a waitress, and she also gets $15 an hour in tips. So, she makes a total of $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

If she works 40 hours a week, she makes $25 * 40 = $1000 per week.

The car Janet wants to buy costs $10,000, and she wants to save 20% of that for the down payment. 20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we need to divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save up for the down payment.

"Let's figure out how many plums Jamaar can buy. First, we need to find out how much money he has left after buying the other fruits. 

He bought 3 peaches for $0.5 each, so that's 3 x $0.5 = $1.5. Then, he bought 4 pears for $0.5 each, which is 4 x $0.5 = $2. Next, he bought 2 kiwis for $1 each, so that's 2 x $1 = $2. Finally, he bought 5 apples for $0.75 each, which is 5 x $0.75 = $3.75.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the fruits he bought: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25. Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"Let's figure out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received.

Anne had 15 packs of sweets. She kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

She gave these 13 packs to 10 friends, so each friend got 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are in 1.3 packs. We can do this by multiplying 0.3 packs by 60 pieces. 

0.3 packs * 60 pieces = 18 pieces.

So, each friend got 60 pieces (from 1 pack) + 18 pieces (from 0.3 packs) = 78 pieces.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to add 5% of the original price to the original price each year.

The original price of carrots is $120. To find 5% of $120, we multiply 0.05 by 120, which is $6. So, the price after one year is $120 + $6 = $126.

Next year, we need to find 5% of $126. To do this, we multiply 0.05 by 126, which is $6.30. So, the price after two years is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Finally, we need to find 5% of $132.30. To do this, we multiply 0.05 by 132.30, which is $6.615. So, the price after three years is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"Let's figure this out. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook. She put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. 

To find out how many pictures are in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 albums are selfies only. So, the number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums = 5 albums. 
The number of portraits is 5 albums * 9 pictures per album = 45 portraits.

So, Olivia has 27 selfies and 45 portraits.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. This means if a small stuffed animal costs $4, a large one costs $12.

We also know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold 'x' small stuffed animals and 'y' large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small ones, we can say x = 2y.

We know that the total amount she earned from selling these stuffed animals is $120. We can write an equation to represent this: 4x + 12y = 120.

Since x = 2y, we can substitute this into the equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120. This simplifies to 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Now that we know y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."

"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to figure out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. If he can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, then he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

Now, let's find out how much ore he can mine with a steel pickaxe. He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now that we know one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, we can find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day. We multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"Let's figure out how much the package with 8 sandwiches costs. We know that the first package has 2 sandwiches for $3 and the second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. 

To find out how much the sandwiches cost, we can divide the price by the number of sandwiches. For the first package, that's $3 ÷ 2 = $1.50 per sandwich. For the second package, that's $6 ÷ 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the price per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can use that to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. We multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches costs $12."
"So, Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the bedroom set. Now, he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month.

First, let's find out how much Tom still owes after selling his old bedroom set. He paid $1000, so we subtract that from the total cost of the bedroom set:

$3000 (total cost) - $1000 (amount paid) = $2000 (amount still owed)

Now, we need to find out how much Tom has to pay each month. The interest rate is 10%, which is the same as 0.10. To find the monthly payment, we multiply the amount still owed by the interest rate:

$2000 (amount still owed) x 0.10 (interest rate) = $200 (monthly payment)

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"Let's figure out how many balloons Sally had at the end.

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. That's 40% of 25, which is 0.4 x 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, and 15 red balloons are left.

Next, Sally let go of half of the yellow balloons. That's 1/2 x 12 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were let go, and 6 yellow balloons are left.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons stuck in a tree. She added 75% of them to her bunch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her bunch.

Now, let's count all the balloons Sally has: 15 red, 7 green, 6 yellow, and 6 blue. That's a total of 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

To do this, we need to subtract 102% from 100%. However, we can't subtract a larger number from a smaller number. Instead, we can subtract 100% from 102% to get 2%. Then, we can subtract 2% from 100% to get 98%.

So, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 98%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"So, Apple High School is having a graduation at their Fine Arts Center. The Fine Arts Center can fit 6000 people. They already have 950 seats for the graduates and 300 seats for the faculty. We need to find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family.

First, we need to find out how many seats are left. We do that by subtracting the reserved seats from the total capacity.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats = 950 + 300
Reserved seats = 1250
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 1250
Available seats = 4750

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

So, each graduate can give 5 tickets to their friends and family."
"Let's figure out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat.

We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. We also know that he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. So, if he can eat 75 large beans, he can eat 2 x 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we need to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. We know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, if we multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3, we can find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat.

150 medium-sized beans x 3 small beans/medium-sized bean = 150 x 3 = 450 small beans

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

The final answer is: 450"
"So, Melissa goes to jury duty for 3 days. She listens to a court case for 6 hours each day. She gets paid $15 per day, but she has to pay $3 for parking each day. 

First, let's find out how much money she makes in total. She gets paid $15 per day for 3 days, so that's 3 x 15 = 45 dollars. 

Now, let's find out how much she spends on parking. She pays $3 per day for 3 days, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 dollars.

To find out how much money she has left after paying for parking, we subtract the parking cost from her total earnings. So, 45 - 9 = 36 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total. She works 6 hours per day for 3 days, so that's 6 x 3 = 18 hours.

To find out how much she makes per hour, we divide her total earnings by the number of hours she worked. So, 36 ÷ 18 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's figure out how much money Ted spent.

Ted bought 3 books for 16 dollars each. To find the total cost of the books, we multiply 3 by 16. That's 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.

Then, he bought 3 pencils for 6 dollars each. To find the total cost of the pencils, we multiply 3 by 6. That's 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we need to add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils together. 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

So, Ted spent a total of $66."
"So, Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet on his 24-foot-wide driveway. To find out how many bottles he can fit, we need to divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle.

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Now, it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next. To find the total time, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's figure out how many packs Uncle Franky can make with the apples. He has two boxes of apples, and each box has 40 apples. So, he has a total of 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Now, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Each pack has 8 apples. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 80 / 8 = 10.

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"To find out how much money Amor has left, we need to know how much she spent on cheese and subtract that from the money she started with.

The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so she spent 2 x $11 = $22 on Parmesan cheese.

The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so she spent 3 x $6 = $18 on mozzarella cheese.

To find the total amount she spent, we add the cost of Parmesan and mozzarella cheese: $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the amount she started with: $50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"Let's figure this out. Jim goes to college for 4 years. He gets a loan of $50,000 each year, so that's a total of 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000. 

He also doesn't get paid for 4 years because he's in school. He used to make $25,000 a year, so that's 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

So, Jim owes $200,000 from the loans and $100,000 because he didn't work. That's a total of $300,000.

After he graduates, his job pays him $75,000 a year because it's triple his old job. To find out how long it takes him to pay off the $300,000, we need to divide $300,000 by $75,000/year.

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we need to know the size of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

Now, we need to find the area of one piece of fabric. To do this, we multiply the length by the width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces, we multiply 80 by 2 to get the total area: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. To find one-fifth of 425, we divide 425 by 5. 425 divided by 5 is 85. Then, we add 17 to that number. 85 + 17 is 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. To find twice as many as Tuesday, we multiply 102 by 2. 102 times 2 is 204. Then, we add 5 to that number. 204 + 5 is 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken salad. There are 10 people who want it, and it costs $6.50 per person. So, we multiply 10 by $6.50 to get the total cost of the chicken salad.

10 x $6.50 = $65

Next, let's find the cost of the pasta salad. There are 6 people who want it, and it costs $6 per person. So, we multiply 6 by $6 to get the total cost of the pasta salad.

6 x $6 = $36

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together to get the total amount Molly will pay for the catering.

$65 + $36 = $101

The final answer is: $101"
"So, Johnny's dad went to the horse racing and bet some money. He lost $5 in the first race. Then, in the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. To find out how much he won, we need to multiply the amount he lost by 2 and then add $1. 

2 * $5 = $10
$10 + $1 = $11

So, he won $11 in the second race. 

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. To find out how much he lost, we need to multiply the amount he won by 1.5.

$11 * 1.5 = $16.50

Now, let's add up all the money he lost and won. He lost $5 in the first race, won $11 in the second, and lost $16.50 in the third. 

$5 + $11 - $16.50 = -$0.50

Since he lost a total of $0.50, and there were 3 races, we need to divide the total loss by the number of races to find the average loss.

$0.50 / 3 = $0.17

The final answer is: $0.17"
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

There are 26 countries in South America. Each country has 5 cities, and each city has 1000 people living in it.

First, we multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country: 26 * 5 = 130
Then, we multiply the result by the population per city: 130 * 1000 = 130,000

The final answer is: 130000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first calculate their current heights.

Xavier was 4 feet tall, and since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert his height to inches. 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches. Then, we add the 3 inches he grew over the summer, so Xavier's height is now 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer, so his height is now 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's say the first person got x dollars. The second person got $80 more than the first, so they got x + 80 dollars. The third person got twice what the second person got, so they got 2(x + 80) dollars.

We know that the total amount of money is $1920. So, we can write an equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Let's simplify the equation. We can combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Now, let's combine the x terms: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Next, we'll subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Now, we'll divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

So, the first person got $420."
"To find out how many hours each painter worked, we need to know how many days they worked and how many hours they worked each day.

There are 7 days in a week, and they worked for 3 weeks, so they worked a total of 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Now, we need to figure out how many hours they worked each day. They worked 3/8 of a day, and there are 24 hours in a day. To find out how many hours that is, we can multiply 24 by 3 and then divide by 8.

24 * 3 = 72
72 / 8 = 9

So, they worked 9 hours each day. Now, we multiply the hours they worked each day by the number of days they worked: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we need to divide the total hours by 4 to find out how many hours each painter worked: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's say the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set is x. 

In the first set, he retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

We know that the total number of balls he retrieved is 19. So, we can write an equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Now, let's simplify the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to figure out how much it loses value each year. The car loses 21% of its value every year. 

First, let's find out how much the car loses in value in one year. 21% of $20,000 is 0.21 x $20,000 = $4,200. So, the car loses $4,200 in value each year.

Now, let's find the price of the car in 2008. The car loses $4,200 in value, so the price in 2008 is $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.

Next, let's find the price of the car in 2009. The car loses $4,200 in value, so the price in 2009 is $15,800 - $4,200 = $11,600.

Finally, let's find the price of the car in 2010. The car loses $4,200 in value, so the price in 2010 is $11,600 - $4,200 = $7,400.

The final answer is: $7400"
"Let's figure out how many Spanish books there are in the library. 

First, we know that half of the books are written in English. That's 50 / 2 = 25 books. 

Next, 10% of the books are written in German. To find 10% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.1. That's 50 * 0.1 = 5 books.

Now, we know that 25 books are in English and 5 books are in German. So, the total number of books that are either in English or German is 25 + 5 = 30.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many more kilometers Bernice needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is 1955 kilometers. Bernice drove 325 kilometers in 4 days.

To find the distance left, we do the following calculation:

1955 (total distance) - 325 (distance driven) = ?

First, we subtract 300 from 1955, which is 1655. Then we subtract 25 from 1655, which is 1630.

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to know how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. 
There are 16 cups in a gallon. 
So, 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

"Let's figure out how many people are on the train at the final stop.

Romeo starts with 120 people on the train. Then, 20 more people get on at the first stop. So, we add 20 to 120:
120 + 20 = 140

Next, at the second stop, 50 people get off the train, but 100 people get on. We need to subtract 50 and then add 100:
140 - 50 = 90
90 + 100 = 190

Finally, at the third stop, 80 people get off the train. We subtract 80 from 190:
190 - 80 = 110

So, there are 110 people on the train at the final stop.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to add up the cost of each item.

First, let's start with the tank top. It costs $10.

Next, we need to find out how much the running shorts cost. They cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.

Now, let's talk about the tennis shoes. They were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. To find the sale price, we need to divide $48 by 2. $48 ÷ 2 = $24.

The athletic socks cost $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off. So, the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

The final answer is: $55"
"To find out how much it will cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to know how many tiles you'll need. Since each tile is a square with a side of 1 foot, it covers 1 square foot.

The total area of your kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find out how many tiles you need, we divide the total area by the area of one tile: 200 square feet / 1 square foot = 200 tiles.

Now, we need to know the cost of each tile. You said each tile costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

"So James has to buy insurance because he had an accident. This means he has to pay more than the normal cost. The normal cost is $120 a month. To find out how much more he has to pay, we need to calculate 60% of $120.

60% of $120 is the same as 0.6 x $120. To multiply a decimal by a number, we can just move the decimal point. So, 0.6 x $120 is the same as $1.20 x 100, which is $120.

Now, we add $120 to $120 to find the increased cost. $120 + $120 is $240. So, James has to pay $240 a month.

To find out how much James has to pay in a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. $240 x 12 is $2880.

The final answer is: $2880"
"Let's figure out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. We need to find out how many sheets that is in total. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Now, we need to find out how many loads of laundry Greg can do in a week. His laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Since Greg can wash 3 sets of sheets in a week, and each set is 1 load, he does 3 loads of laundry per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we multiply the loads per week by the number of weeks in a year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"Let's figure out how many movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies as they do on Saturday. Since half of 4 is 2, they watch 2 movies on Sunday.

"Let's figure out how many days the cat food will last. Imma has 3 cats and she feeds them twice a day. Each time, she gives them 60 grams of cat food. 

To find out how many days the food will last, we need to know how much food all the cats eat in one day. Since each cat eats 60 grams twice a day, that's 60 * 2 = 120 grams per cat per day.

Now, we have 3 cats, so we multiply 120 grams by 3: 120 * 3 = 360 grams per day for all the cats.

We have 720 grams of cat food in total. To find out how many days it will last, we divide 720 by 360: 720 / 360 = 2.

So, the cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's figure out how many slices of pizza they ate in total.

First, we need to know how many slices of pizza there are in total. Since there are 4 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, we multiply 4 by 8 to get the total number of slices. 4 x 8 = 32 slices.

Now, we know Becky ate 10 slices. We also know that Jake ate 3 slices less than Becky, so Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 x 7 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add up the slices each person ate: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's say Donovan's part of making the meal took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time to make the meal is 98 minutes. So, we can add the time Donovan took and the time Betsy took to get 98 minutes. This gives us the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

We can simplify this equation by combining the x's:

2x + 18 = 98

Now, we need to get rid of the 18 on the left side. We can do this by subtracting 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Next, we need to get x by itself. To do this, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we add 18 to 40 to find Betsy's part:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: 58"
"So, Hannah slipped on a banana peel and broke her arm. The doctor helped her and charged her for some things. Let's add up how much she owes.

First, the doctor charged her $200 for a cast. Then, she charged her $300 for a visit, but it was only 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the visit cost $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Next, the doctor gave her 30 painkillers, and each one cost $4. So, the painkillers cost $4 * 30 = $120.

Lastly, the doctor charged her for parking. She had to park for at least 2 hours, and it cost $6 per hour. So, the parking cost $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"Let's figure this out. James gets 80 emails a day. But 20% of those emails don't need a response. To find 20% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.2. 

80 * 0.2 = 16

So, James doesn't need to respond to 16 emails. That means he needs to respond to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5.

64 * 5 = 320

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited. 
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

The final answer is: 247"
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80. 

First, let's add up the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"Let's figure out how many pizzas are left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7. That's 20 x 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total cost of mailing small coupons. There are 700 small coupons, and each one costs 5 cents to mail. So, we multiply 700 by 5 cents to get the total cost.

700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents

Now, let's find the total cost of mailing big coupons. There are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so there are 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so we multiply 1400 by 15 cents to get the total cost.

1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents

Now, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together to get the total cost of postage.

3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

To make it easier to understand, we can convert cents to dollars by dividing by 100. 

24500 / 100 = 245 dollars

The final answer is: $245"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, Sidney ordered 3 less than 10 meatball sub sandwiches. That means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Each of these sandwiches has 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Now, there are 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.

Sidney ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, so now there are 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches left.

Each of these 6 sandwiches has 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in the 6 sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"So, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks that were going to deliver fertiliser to the farmers. Each truck had 20 tons of fertiliser. But, 2 hours later, he found out that 5 trucks had broken down and couldn't deliver the fertiliser.

To find out how many trucks were still working, we need to subtract the number of broken-down trucks from the total number of trucks. 

20 (total trucks) - 5 (broken-down trucks) = 15 trucks

Now, we know that 15 trucks were still working. And each of these trucks had 20 tons of fertiliser. So, to find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of working trucks by the tons of fertiliser each truck had.

15 (working trucks) * 20 (tons per truck) = 300 tons

The final answer is: 300"
"To find out how much it will cost Dennis to buy 6 pounds of butter, we need to think about the promotion at the store. They're offering buy one pound of butter, get one half off. 

Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, so let's break it down into sets of 2 pounds. He'll need 3 sets of 2 pounds. 

For each set of 2 pounds, he'll pay full price for one pound ($4.00) and half off for the other pound ($2.00). 

So, for 3 sets of 2 pounds, he'll pay:
- 3 sets * $4.00 = $12.00
- 3 sets * $2.00 = $6.00
- Total cost for 6 pounds of butter = $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to know how many people are going to the party. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. That's a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people. But 4 people said they couldn't come, so we need to subtract 4 from 45. 45 - 4 = 41 people are going to the party.

Since the theater can hold 20 people for free, we need to find out how many extra people are coming. 41 - 20 = 21 extra people. Each extra person costs $6, so we multiply 21 by 6. 21 * 6 = 126. We also have to pay a $125 fee to rent the theater. So, the total cost is 126 + 125 = 251.

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. If she had $60, we need to find 3/4 of $60. To do that, we multiply 3/4 by $60. 

3/4 * $60 = $45

So, Maggie has $45 left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. If she had $60, we need to find 2/3 of $60. To do that, we multiply 2/3 by $60.

2/3 * $60 = $40

So, Riza has $40 left.

Now, let's add the money Maggie and Riza have: $45 + $40 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's figure out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day.

We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for his three monkeys. They eat these bananas for a week, which is 7 days. 

First, we need to find out how many bananas the monkeys eat each day. To do this, we divide the total number of bananas (315) by the number of days (7). 

315 ÷ 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, we know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

So, the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the number of bananas the first two monkeys eat from the total number of bananas eaten each day.

45 (total bananas per day) - 24 (bananas eaten by the first two monkeys) = 21 bananas.

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's figure this out. Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle. That's 500 divided by 2, which is 250 pieces. Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. So, we need to add those two numbers together. 

250 + 500 = 750

The final answer is: 750"
"Jenny went to the florist to buy some flowers. Roses cost $2 each, but if you buy a dozen (12 roses), it's cheaper - it costs $15 for a dozen. Jenny bought 15 roses. 

Since 15 roses is more than a dozen, she bought 1 dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses. 

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny had 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Terry makes, we need to add up the money he makes from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas.

First, let's calculate the money from the milkshakes. He sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each. So, 6 x $5.50 = $33.

Next, let's calculate the money from the burger platters. He sells 9 burger platters for $11 each. So, 9 x $11 = $99.

Lastly, let's calculate the money from the sodas. He sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each. So, 20 x $1.50 = $30.

Now, let's add up the money from all the items: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"Let's figure out how long Paul will wait for his train.

The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes. It will stay in the station for 20 minutes. So, it will leave the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train will arrive 30 minutes after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train will arrive at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train will stay in the station for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, it will leave the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train will arrive 60 minutes after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train will arrive at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train will leave the station right away, so it will leave at 125 minutes.

The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train will arrive at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's find out how long Paul will wait for his train. He will wait from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train, from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train, from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train, and from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

"Melanie wants to make a toothpick sculpture that needs 200 toothpicks. She saves 10 toothpicks every week from her mom's sandwiches. She has been saving toothpicks for 12 weeks already. To find out how many more weeks she needs to save toothpicks, we need to know how many toothpicks she has saved so far.

She saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so she has saved a total of:
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, and she already has 120, she needs 80 more toothpicks:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's say Mr. Rogers bought a watch that originally costs $2000. He bought it for 75% of the original price, which means he paid 75% of $2000. To find 75% of $2000, we multiply 2000 by 0.75.

2000 * 0.75 = $1500

So, Mr. Rogers bought the watch for $1500. Then, he sold it to his friend for 120% of the price he bought it for. To find 120% of $1500, we multiply 1500 by 1.2.

1500 * 1.2 = $1800

Now, we need to find the discount that Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price. To do this, we subtract the price his friend paid from the original price.

$2000 - $1800 = $200

The discount is $200. To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100.

($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%

So, Mr. Rogers' friend got a 10% discount from the original price.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs create in 4 hours, we need to know how many seconds are in 4 hours. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, and 60 minutes in 1 hour. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 seconds/hour
3600 seconds/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, and there are 5 springs, they create 5 jellyfish per second. 

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"Let's figure out Frankie's bowling score. We know Binkie's score is 90. To find Frankie's score, we need to double Binkie's score first. 

Doubling Binkie's score is the same as multiplying it by 2. So, 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, we need to add 15 to 180 to find Frankie's score. 

180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"Let's figure this out. James is going to the store, but then he has to go back home because he forgot something. His house is 4 miles away from the store. 

To find out how long it took him to get to the store, we need to think about how far he walked. Since he walked halfway to the store and then all the way back, that's like walking the whole distance twice. So, he walked 4 miles to the store and 4 miles back home, which is a total of 4 + 4 = 8 miles.

Now, we need to find out how long it took him to walk 8 miles. We know he walks 4 miles per hour. To find the time, we can divide the total distance by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's figure out how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches.

First, we need to know how many bananas she bought. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, she bought 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

If she bought each banana for $0.80, the total cost would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

But she bought the bananas in bunches for $3.00 each. Since she bought 10 bunches, the total cost would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's say Sam gets some amount of fence, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. If they have 100 feet of fence in total, we can make an equation to solve it.

Let's say Sam gets 'x' feet of fence. Then Harry gets 'x + 60' feet of fence. Since they have 100 feet in total, we can write the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Now, let's get rid of the 60 by subtracting it from both sides: 2x = 40.

To find out how much fence Sam gets, we need to divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to know how much it grows each year. We know that it grows 8 inches in 4 years. 

Let's divide the total growth by the number of years to find the growth per year. 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"Let's figure out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles. 

First, we need to know how many of each type of bike he sold. We know that he sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so that's 150 Trekking bikes. Then, 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15. That's 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we need to find out how many MTB bikes Marcel sold. We know he sold 150 Trekking bikes and 45 BMX bikes, so we subtract those from the total number of bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Next, we need to find out how much Marcel earned from each type of bike. A Trekking bike costs $450, so 150 Trekking bikes would be 150 x $450 = $67,500. A BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500. So, a BMX bike costs $250. 45 BMX bikes would be 45 x $250 = $11,250. An MTB costs $500, so 105 MTB bikes would be 105 x $500 = $52,500.

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay every hour. If it works for 6 hours, it will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales of hay.

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we need to subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made. So, we do 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to do some math.

First, let's figure out how many minutes he spends in class each day. He has 6 periods, and each period is 40 minutes long. So, that's 6 x 40 = 240 minutes per day.

Since he goes to school 5 days a week, we multiply 240 minutes by 5 to get the total minutes he spends in class each week. That's 240 x 5 = 1200 minutes per week.

But John also has 2 extra classes, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, that's 2 x 40 = 80 minutes per day for the extra classes. Multiply that by 5 to get the total minutes for the extra classes each week: 80 x 5 = 400 minutes per week.

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular classes and the extra classes: 1200 + 400 = 1600 minutes per week.

John also spends some time learning on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his total weekly minutes on these days. To find out how many minutes that is, we need to know his total weekly minutes. There are 7 days in a week, and each day has 24 hours, with 60 minutes in each hour. So, that's 7 x 24 x 60 = 1680 minutes per week.

Now, let's find 1/16 of 1680: 1680 / 16 = 105 minutes per day. Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, we multiply 105 by 2: 105 x 2 = 210 minutes per week.

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes, and the extra minutes for Saturday and Sunday: 1600 + 210 = 1810 minutes per week.

Finally, let's convert the total minutes to hours: 1810 minutes / 60 = 30.17 hours.

The final answer is: 30.17"
"So, Nathan drops a bouncy ball from the third-floor balcony in the mall. Each story is 24 feet high, so the ball starts at 3 stories high, which is 3 x 24 = 72 feet.

Now, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height. To find the height after the first bounce, we multiply 72 by 2/3. To do this, we can multiply 72 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

72 x 2 = 144
144 ÷ 3 = 48

So, the ball goes up 48 feet after the first bounce. Now, we need to find the height after the second bounce. We multiply 48 by 2/3 again.

48 x 2 = 96
96 ÷ 3 = 32

The ball goes up 32 feet after the second bounce."
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to figure out how tall each child is.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 6 by 12 to get the height in inches. 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 to 72. 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 from 74. 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 to 69. 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to know how many bags of apples they sold. Since each bag has 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200

Now that we know they sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"Let's figure out how much meat was on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate it. 

First, we know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat. But before the Allosaurus ate, the velociraptors had that same amount. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, they must have had twice as much as the Allosaurus ate. So, the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Now, we know that the velociraptors ate half of what the T-Rex had. So, the T-Rex must have had twice as much as the velociraptors had. That's 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

But wait, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, the triceratops must have had twice as much as the T-Rex had. That's 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

So, the triceratops had 2160 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate it.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to know the total area of the walls and how much paint it will take to cover that area.

The north and south walls are 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 

The east and west walls are 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of all the walls together: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons we need: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon: 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"So, Ellen has 12 sodas and she shakes 3 of them. Then she takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. Now, there are 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas left.

Ellen's brother comes along and takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. Now, there's 1 shaken soda and 6 unshaken sodas left.

Ellen's friend is going to pick a soda, and we want to know the chance that she gets a shaken soda. There's 1 shaken soda out of 7 sodas in total.

To find the chance, we divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas:

Chance = 1 / 7
Chance = 0.14285714285714285 (this is a decimal, but we want a percentage)

To turn this into a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Chance = 0.14285714285714285 * 100
Chance = 14.285714285714286 (this is still a decimal, but we can round it)

Rounded to two decimal places, the chance is 14.29%

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.29}$"
"Let's say we have two trains that are moving away from each other. One train is going 60 miles per hour, and the other train is going half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

We need to find out how far apart they are after 3 hours. To do this, we need to find out how far each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is going 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 x 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is going 30 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 x 3 = 90 miles.

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance between the two trains: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"Let's figure out how many people Billy can help with their taxes. 

First, we need to find out how many days Billy is working. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Now, Billy takes 20% of the days off. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 0.2 by 50. 
0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, we multiply the number of days Billy works by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he helps: 
40 * 6 = 240

The final answer is: 240"
"So, Mary and John got married last weekend. There were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church. After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people. We need to find out how many people were inside the church.

First, let's calculate how many people were in the buses. There were 12 buses and each bus carried 35 people. So, we multiply 12 by 35 to get the total number of people in the buses: 12 * 35 = 420.

Next, let's calculate how many people were in the cars. There were 20 cars and each car carried 3 people. So, we multiply 20 by 3 to get the total number of people in the cars: 20 * 3 = 60.

Now, we add the number of people in the buses and the cars to get the total number of people who were transported: 420 + 60 = 480.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can assume that the number of people inside the church is equal to the number of people who were transported.

The final answer is: 480"
"Let's figure out how old Jeff is. We know Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. To find Martha's age, we need to subtract 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, we know Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we need to add 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to figure out how long it takes to ride each slide.

The biggest slide is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet per minute. To find the time, we divide the length by the speed: 300 / 60 = 5 minutes.

The second biggest slide is 240 feet long, and people slide down at 80 feet per minute. To find the time, we divide the length by the speed: 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many hours Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to add up the time he spends each day.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 breaks of 15 minutes each. 
First, let's add up the time he spends on breaks: 2 breaks * 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
Now, let's add the time he spends on lunch: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's figure out how many miles Ahito ran. We know that Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so we need to multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that Amber and Micah ran a total of 8 + 28 = 36 miles. Since they ran a total of 52 miles, we can subtract 36 from 52 to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's figure out Sheila's new credit card balance.

First, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of stuff on her credit card. Then, she returned one item that cost $15.00. So, we need to subtract $15.00 from $85.00.

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's talk about the new stuff she bought. There was a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20 (which is the same as 20%).

$20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from $20.00 to get the price of the frying pan.

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, there was a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 0.10 (which is the same as 10%).

$30.00 x 0.10 = $3.00

Now, we subtract the discount from $30.00 to get the price of the towels.

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, we add the prices of the frying pan and the towels to get the total cost of the new stuff.

$16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Finally, we add the total cost of the new stuff to the new balance of $70.00.

$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's figure out how many jellyfish are in the tank.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are big, and a third of those big jellyfish change color when they see UV light. The rest of the jellyfish are small and stay blue all the time.

When the UV light turns on, 6 jellyfish change color. This means that 6 jellyfish are big and can change color.

Since a third of the big jellyfish change color, we can find out how many big jellyfish there are in total. If 6 is a third of the big jellyfish, then the total number of big jellyfish is 6 * 3 = 18.

Now, we know that 18 jellyfish are big, and they make up a fifth of the total number of jellyfish. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply 18 by 5. 

18 * 5 = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's figure out how old Caroline is. We know Chris is 4 years old. Ben is two times older than Chris, so we multiply Chris's age by 2 to find Ben's age:
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. To find Caroline's age, we multiply Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's figure out how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement.

Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck every time she gets paid. Her current salary is $100,000 per year. To find out how much she saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of $100,000.

20% of $100,000 is the same as 0.20 x $100,000. To find 0.20 x $100,000, we multiply 0.20 by 100,000. This is the same as moving the decimal point two places to the left, so 0.20 x 100,000 is $20,000.

So, Lauren saves $20,000 each year.

Lauren wants to save enough money to live for 20 years in retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current salary, which is $40,000 per year. To find out how much money she needs to save for retirement, we multiply her annual retirement income by the number of years she plans to live in retirement.

$40,000 x 20 years is $800,000.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take Lauren to save $800,000 at a rate of $20,000 per year. To do this, we divide the total amount she needs to save ($800,000) by the amount she saves each year ($20,000).

$800,000 ÷ $20,000 is 40.

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough money for retirement.

"Let's figure this out. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He wants to cut it into 4 equal parts, and then cut each of those parts into 5 equal parts.

First, we need to divide the 100 centimeters into 4 equal parts. To do that, we divide 100 by 4. That's 100 ÷ 4 = 25. So each of the 4 parts will be 25 centimeters long.

Now, we need to cut each of those 25-centimeter parts into 5 equal parts. To do that, we divide 25 by 5. That's 25 ÷ 5 = 5. So each of the final cuts will be 5 centimeters long.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of girls in the school, we need to know the total number of students. Since 40% of the students are boys and there are 240 boys, we can use this information to find the total number of students.

We know that 40% of the students are boys, so 60% must be girls. To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation: 40% of the total number of students is 240.

To find the total number of students, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40/100 = 0.4. Then, we can divide 240 by 0.4 to find the total number of students: 240 / 0.4 = 600.

Now that we know there are 600 students in total, we can find the number of girls. Since 60% of the students are girls, we can convert 60% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 60/100 = 0.6. Then, we can multiply 0.6 by 600 to find the number of girls: 0.6 * 600 = 360.

"To find out how much money my mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the coupon discount.

First, we add the cost of the pots and the garden soil. The pots cost $19 and the garden soil costs $26. So, $19 + $26 is $45.

Next, we need to subtract the discount. The coupon was for $7 off. So, we subtract $7 from $45. $45 - $7 is $38.

So, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop.

The final answer is: $38"
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to add up the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

There are 3 women wearing 4 inch heels and 3 women wearing 2 inch heels. 

The total height of the 4 inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2 inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

Now, we add the total height of both types of heels: 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average, we divide the total height by the number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

So, the average height of the heels is 3 inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. She plans to hike 125 miles twice a day. To find out how many miles she hikes in a day, we multiply 125 miles by 2, which is 250 miles.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles. We can do this by dividing 9,300 miles by 250 miles per day. 9,300 ÷ 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she won't be able to finish her hike. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike in a day, we need to know how many miles she can hike in 30 days. We multiply 250 miles per day by 30 days, which is 7,500 miles.

Now, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike in total. We subtract 7,500 miles from 9,300 miles, which is 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we divide 1,800 miles by 30 days. 1,800 ÷ 30 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's say we have 3 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 25 green balls in the store. We need to find out how much money the store will get if they sell all the balls.

Red balls cost $9 each, so if they sell 3 of them, they will get 3 x $9 = $27.

Blue balls cost $5 each, so if they sell 11 of them, they will get 11 x $5 = $55.

Green balls cost $3 each, so if they sell 25 of them, they will get 25 x $3 = $75.

Now, let's add up all the money they will get: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

"Let's figure out how much money Raymond has left.

Raymond started with $21. Then he got $11 more from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.

Next, he spent $5 on a comic book. To find out how much he has left, we need to subtract $5 from $32. $32 - $5 = $27.

After that, he spent $19 on a puzzle. To find out how much he has left now, we need to subtract $19 from $27. $27 - $19 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left."
"Let's figure out how much each book cost. Anna had $16 to spend, but she already spent $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. 

After buying the 2 books, she had $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

"Let's count the number of male and female fishes in Tate's garden pond.

There are 4 male guppies and 7 female guppies. Tate buys 2 more male guppies and 1 more female guppy. So, we add 2 + 4 = 6 male guppies and 1 + 7 = 8 female guppies.

There are 3 male goldfishes and 5 female goldfishes. Tate buys 2 more male goldfishes and 3 more female goldfishes. So, we add 2 + 3 = 5 male goldfishes and 3 + 5 = 8 female goldfishes.

Now, let's count the total number of male and female fishes. We have 6 male guppies and 5 male goldfishes, so 6 + 5 = 11 male fishes. We have 8 female guppies and 8 female goldfishes, so 8 + 8 = 16 female fishes.

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes: 16 - 11 = 5.

"To find out how many miles John drives in a month, we need to figure out how far he drives in one round trip to his parents' house. 

First, we need to find out how far it is to his parents' house. We know it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since he has to drive back home, we need to multiply the one-way distance by 2 to get the total round trip distance:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"Let's figure this out. We know that Sofie is going to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days. To find out how far she will walk in total, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days. That's 10 x 7 = 70 miles.

Now, we know that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. So, to find out how far Brian will walk, we need to divide the total distance Sofie walks by 2. That's 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know that 2 workers can make 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers can make 4 toys an hour. So, let's add those together to find out how many toys those 4 workers can make in an hour. 

2 workers * 6 toys per hour = 12 toys per hour
2 workers * 4 toys per hour = 8 toys per hour
12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour

Now, we know that 4 workers can make 20 toys in an hour. If they work for 10 hours, they can make 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

We know that the manufacturer needs 400 toys in total, and they already have 200 toys. So, they need 400 - 200 = 200 more toys.

Since the fifth worker made the remaining toys, and they worked for 10 hours, we can find out how many toys they made per hour by dividing the number of toys they made by the number of hours they worked. 

200 toys / 10 hours = 20 toys per hour

"Let's figure out how much Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh altogether.

We know that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah has two dogs. One of his dogs weighs one-fourth of Kory's dog, and the other weighs half of Kory's dog.

To find the weight of Elijah's first dog, we need to divide 60 by 4. 60 divided by 4 is 15. So, Elijah's first dog weighs 15 pounds.

To find the weight of Elijah's second dog, we need to divide 60 by 2. 60 divided by 2 is 30. So, Elijah's second dog weighs 30 pounds.

Now, we need to add up the weights of all the dogs. We have Kory's dog, which weighs 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog, which weighs 15 pounds, and Elijah's second dog, which weighs 30 pounds.

60 + 15 + 30 = 105

"Let's figure this out. John buys 3 big bags of M&M's, and each bag weighs 10 ounces. We need to find out how many small bags he can make if he puts 10 M&M's in each small bag.

First, we need to find out how many M&M's are in the 3 big bags. Since each ounce has 30 M&M's, we multiply the number of ounces by 30.

3 big bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we know there are 900 M&M's in total. Since each small bag has 10 M&M's, we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

First, we need to find out what half of the earth's circumference is. The earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers. To find half of that, we divide 40,000 by 2.

40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers

Now, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we need to divide 20,000 by 400.

20,000 / 400 = 50

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly half the way around the earth.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs.

Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation x + (x + 12) = 30.

Combine like terms to get 2x + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides to get 2x = 18.

Divide both sides by 2 to get x = 9.

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. Let's say they each painted y eggs. Then the equation is y + y + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms to get 2y + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides to get 2y = 26.

Divide both sides by 2 to get y = 13.

So Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's figure out the total weight of Nik's crayons and boxes.

First, we need to find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, we multiply 200 by 1, which is 200 ounces.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes Nik will need. Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide 200 by 8. This is the same as 200 ÷ 8 = 25. So, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Now, we need to find the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes. We multiply 25 by 8, which is 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes. 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we need to convert 400 ounces to pounds. We do this by dividing 400 by 16. 400 ÷ 16 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John makes, we need to figure out how many logs he can make from the tree. Since the tree is 80 feet long, and he can make logs out of 80% of it, we need to find 80% of 80.

80% of 80 is the same as 0.8 x 80, which is 64. So, John can make 64 feet of logs.

Since each log is 4 feet long, we need to divide 64 by 4 to find out how many logs he can make.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

Now, we know John can make 16 logs. From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply 16 by 5 to find out how many planks he can make.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2. To find out how much money he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

"Let's break down Grandma's walk into two parts: the part on the beach and the part on the sidewalk. We know she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.

We're told that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach, we can find her speed on the beach by dividing the distance by the time. So, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1/20 miles per minute.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. We can do this by dividing the distance by her speed: 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute) = 10 minutes.

So, it takes her 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Now, we can find the total time it takes her to walk the entire 3 miles by adding the time spent on the beach (40 minutes) and the time spent on the sidewalk (10 minutes). 

The total time is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"Let's figure out how many marbles Bob has. If he gets 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 2 x 12, which is 24. So, if he gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 + 24 = 84 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has before he gets 2 dozen more marbles. Let's call the number of marbles he has before getting 2 dozen more marbles 'x'. Then, x + 24 = 84. To find 'x', we need to get rid of the 24 on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation. So, x = 84 - 24 = 60.

Now that we know Bob has 60 marbles before getting 2 dozen more marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 60: 60 - 10 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know Donny has two mugs of water. One is 33 degrees, and the other is unknown. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. Now he can drink the water, which means the temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees.

Let's say the temperature of the other mug is x degrees. When Donny pours the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. There are 5 ounces of water in the bottle (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug).

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up an inequality to solve for x:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

(33 + x) * 5 >= 80

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

165 + 5x >= 80

Now, we subtract 165 from both sides:

5x >= -85

Finally, we divide both sides by 5:

x >= -17

Since x is a temperature, it can't be negative. So, the minimum temperature of the other mug is at least 40 degrees.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's figure out how many animals Melanie's father has on his farm after three weeks.

He starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Every day, Milkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows and Broilers Limited brings him 10 chickens. There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are 21 days.

First, let's find out how many cows he gets in three weeks. He gets 20 cows per day, so in 21 days, he gets 20 * 21 = 420 cows. Now, we add the cows he already had, which is 50. So, he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

Next, let's find out how many chickens he gets in three weeks. He gets 10 chickens per day, so in 21 days, he gets 10 * 21 = 210 chickens. Now, we add the chickens he already had, which is 20. So, he has 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

Now, we add the total number of cows and chickens to find out how many animals he has in total. 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"So, Russell orders 4 packs of bagels. Each pack costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in it. If he gets a 10% discount on 4 packs, how much will each bagel cost?

First, we need to find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels. We multiply the cost of one pack by 4.
4 packs * $10.00 = $40.00

Now, we need to find 10% of $40.00. To do this, we multiply $40.00 by 0.1.
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost.
$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Next, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs. We multiply the number of bagels in one pack by 4.
4 packs * 9 bagels = 36 bagels

Now, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost of each single bagel.
$36.00 ÷ 36 bagels = $1.00

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes he ate first. We know he ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we need to subtract 5 from 23. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops. To find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop, we need to divide 3 by 2.

3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we know Gomer ate 18 scoops. To find out how many potatoes he ate, we need to multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop.

18 * 1.5 = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's figure out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days.

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days. To find out how many eggs he eats in 30 days, we multiply 3 eggs by 30 days.
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Then, Chester eats 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days. We multiply 5 eggs by 30 days.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods together to find the total number of eggs.
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
240 eggs / 12 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's figure out how many blue jellybeans are in the jar. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. That means there are 2 x 17 = 34 red jellybeans.

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans together: 17 + 34 = 51.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's figure out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade. 

First, we need to know how many lemons he gets in a year. He has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons. So, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons each tree gives:

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, we need to find out how many years are in a decade. A decade has 10 years. So, we multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10:

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

The final answer is: 300"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. 

To find out how many groups of 14 (5 men + 9 women) are on the bus, we divide the total number of passengers by 14. 

84 ÷ 14 = 6. 

This means there are 6 groups of 14 people on the bus. 

Since each group has 9 women, we multiply 6 groups by 9 women per group: 6 * 9 = 54. 

So, there are 54 women on the bus initially. 

Now, 20 women get off the bus. To find out how many women are left, we subtract 20 from 54: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's figure out how many sunflowers Faraday sold. 

First, we need to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquets per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to get the number of bouquets sold per day.

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 12 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets.

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold per day from the individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from the sunflowers per day, we can divide $26 by $2 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day.

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can add the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

The final answer is: 291"
"Let's figure out how much money Adam loses.

Adam has $100 to spend on rocks. He buys rocks for $5 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 ÷ $5 = 20 rocks

Now, Adam sells 60% of his rocks. To find 60% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.6:

20 x 0.6 = 12 rocks

Adam sells these 12 rocks for $7 each. To find out how much money he makes, we multiply the number of rocks he sells by the price of each rock:

12 x $7 = $84

Now, let's find out how much it costs Adam to buy 20 rocks:

20 x $5 = $100

But Adam only sells 12 rocks, so he still has 8 rocks left. He has to pay for these rocks too. To find out how much it costs him, we multiply the number of rocks he didn't sell by the price of each rock:

8 x $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 + $40 = $140

Now, we subtract the money Adam made from the total cost to find out how much he loses:

$140 - $84 = $56

The final answer is: $56"

"Let's figure out how many roses Patricia has now.

First, Patricia had 30 roses. Then, she gave 24 roses to her mom. To find out how many roses she has left, we need to subtract 24 from 30.

30 - 24 = 6

So, Patricia has 6 roses left. Then, she bought 15 more roses. To find out how many roses she has now, we need to add 15 to 6.

6 + 15 = 21

Now, Patricia has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, and then he traveled 140 miles in 3 hours. 

First, let's add up the total distance he traveled: 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

Next, we need to add up the total time he took: 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's say Mark buys two lottery tickets. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. This means that if he buys 100 tickets, 20 of them will win. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one. So, if the first ticket has a 20% chance, the second ticket has a 20 * 3 = 60% chance of winning.

To find the chance that both tickets win, we need to multiply their chances together. 

20% * 60% = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To turn this into a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%

So, the chance that both tickets win is 12%."
"Let's figure out how many seashells each person gets.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells. But we also know that he collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. So, if we subtract 5 from 27, we get the number of seashells Carlos collected. 

27 - 5 = 22

This means Carlos collected 22 seashells. Now, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. If we divide 22 by 2, we get the number of seashells Carrey collected.

22 / 2 = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells. Now we know how many seashells each person collected. We can add them up to find the total number of seashells.

27 + 22 + 11 = 60

Now, we need to divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person gets.

60 / 3 = 20

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6.

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes and 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

First, we need to find out how much he spent on the devices. He bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday. So, the total number of devices he bought is 2 + 4 = 6.

Each device costs $20, so the total amount he spent is 6 * $20 = $120.

Now, let's find out how much he made from selling the devices. He sold each device for twice the amount he bought it for, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He sold 6 devices, so the total amount he made is 6 * $40 = $240.

To find the profit, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he made. So, the profit is $240 - $120 = $120.

"Let's figure this out step by step. 

We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall. We also know that Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. To find out how tall Ned is, we need to subtract 2 from 7.

Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Now, we know that Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned. To find out how tall Carl is, we need to add 1 to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We also know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to divide his height by 2.

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to know how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Abraham has 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50. Half of 80 is 40, so he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Then, he sold 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20, so he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, let's find out how much land is left. He had 80 square meters and sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. So, he has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 x 3 = $60 from selling the remaining land.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale. 

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to find half of Haley's age first. Haley is 26 years old. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

Now, we need to subtract 10 from 13 because Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age. 

13 - 10 = 3.

So, Geb is 3 years old."
"Let's figure this out. Tyrion goes out 3 times a day and he changes his face mask 2 times every time he goes out. So, to find out how many face masks he uses in a day, we multiply the number of times he goes out by the number of times he changes his mask.

3 (times he goes out) * 2 (times he changes his mask) = 6

Now, we need to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days. We can multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2.

6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's figure out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard.

First, we need to know how many eggs each person found. Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so she found 2 x 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. We need to know what 3 dozen is. 1 dozen is 12, so 3 dozen is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's figure out how much money John makes in a week. 

First, we need to find out how many apartments John collects from in total. There are 2 apartment complexes with 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6, which is 240. Then we add 240 to 400, which is 640. 

So, the third complex has 640 apartments. Now we add the apartments from all three complexes: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1440 * 3 = 4320 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): This year, the tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We don't know how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces yet, so let's call that number 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 5 (9 years old): The tree doesn't produce any fruits this year.
- Year 6 (10 years old): A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we need to find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. 

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000, x = 1200. 

So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 0 + 1000 = 1550

The final answer is: 1550"

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope. If we call the length of the blue rope ""B"", then the length of the red rope is 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If we call the length of the yellow rope ""Y"", then the length of the blue rope is Y - 7.

We are also told that the total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write an equation: R + B + Y = 37.

Since R = 4B, we can substitute this into the equation: 4B + B + Y = 37.

Combine like terms: 5B + Y = 37.

Now, we know that B = Y - 7. We can substitute this into the equation: 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37.

This simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms: 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides: 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6: Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B: B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R: R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, Rissa got three times as much money as Ronnie. If Ronnie got $5, then Rissa got 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, let's say they both gave an equal amount of money to their little sister. Let's call the amount they gave 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.
(15 - x) = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's figure out how much red paint was used in the mural. We know there are four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. We also know that half of the mural is yellow, so the other half is the other three colors combined.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's call the amount of each of these colors ""x"". So, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3x.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints, which is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. This means 3x = 6.

To find out how much paint each of the colors (red, white, and purple) gets, we need to solve for x. We can do this by dividing 6 by 3. x = 6 / 3 = 2.

Since x is the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of each, the amount of red paint is also 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom. It's 20 feet wide and 12 feet long, so we multiply those numbers together: 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, we multiply the area of one bedroom by 4: 240 * 4 = 960 square feet.

Now, let's find the area of the living room. It's 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so we multiply the area of one bedroom by 5: 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to figure out how many clouds she saw each day and add them up.

On Monday, Alice saw 3 clouds. 
On Tuesday, she saw double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she saw double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"Let's figure out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1.

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2. That's 100 x 0.2 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

So, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles with the new box for $1.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Thomas takes out $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank. Since each bill is $20, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

Then, he loses 10 bills on the way home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. Now, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

After that, he triples his money. This means he now has 3 times as many bills as before. So, he has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, he has 60 * 5 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that team A scores 4 goals in the first half. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

Now, let's think about the second half. Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

So, in the first half, team A scores 4 goals and team B scores 2 goals. In the second half, team A scores 2 goals and team B scores 8 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we add the goals scored by both teams in both halves. Team A scores 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and team B scores 2 + 8 = 10 goals. 

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"Let's figure this out step by step. The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it, so he has 55% left. To find 55% of 5 inches, we multiply 0.55 by 5.

0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Now, the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. We need to find out how many days he can use the chalk before it gets too small. Let's call the number of days 'x'. The teacher uses 20% of 2.75 inches each day, which is 0.55 inches.

We can set up an equation to find 'x':

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk."
"Let's figure this out. We have 12 boys and 12 girls in Miss Albert's class. We need to find out how many students are not on the varsity team.

First, let's find out how many girls are on the varsity team. One-third of the girls are on the team, so we multiply 12 by 1/3. That's 12 * 1/3 = 4 girls on the varsity team.

Next, let's find out how many boys are on the varsity team. One-fourth of the boys are on the team, so we multiply 12 by 1/4. That's 12 * 1/4 = 3 boys on the varsity team.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on the varsity team to get the total number of students on the team. 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on the varsity team.

To find out how many students are not on the varsity team, we subtract the number of students on the team from the total number of students in the class. There are 12 boys and 12 girls, so there are 12 + 12 = 24 students in the class. 24 - 7 = 17 students are not on the varsity team.

The dentist fixes a total of 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to divide 15 by 30 and multiply by 100. 

15 / 30 = 0.5
0.5 * 100 = 50%

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. If we let C be Colin's current age, then in 7 years, Colin will be C + 7 years old. So, Wendy's age is 5 times that, which is 5(C + 7).

We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. If we let W be Wendy's current age, then in 25 years, Colin will be C + 25 years old. We know that this is a third of Wendy's current age, so we can write the equation: C + 25 = (1/3)W.

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation. We know that W = 5(C + 7), so we can substitute that in for W:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 3:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Now, let's get all the C terms on one side and the numbers on the other side. We can do this by subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Next, we can subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Finally, we can divide both sides by 2 to find the value of C:
20 = C

First, we need to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27,000. To do that, we divide $27,000 by $500.

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Now, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since he's buying for 3 schools, we divide the total number of sets by 3.

54 ÷ 3 = 18

So, Bob can buy 18 sets of 100 books per school."
"Let's figure out how many apples Newton brought home.

First, 2 apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree. This made 5 more apples fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples.

Next, he put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket. So, he has 1 apple left outside and 5 apples in his pocket. Then, he threw the remaining apple at the tree, and 6 more apples fell out. Now, he has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples.

So, he has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples, which makes a total of 12 apples. Newton picked up all the remaining apples, so he brought home 12 apples.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find out how much Ali's order costs, we need to know how many bags of coal he got and how much each bag costs.

First, we need to find out how many bags of coal Ali got. We know he ordered 850 kilos of coal and each bag is 50 kilos. 

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now that we know Ali got 17 bags, we need to find out how much each bag costs. We know each bag costs $18.

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"Let's figure out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy. 

First, we need to find out how many slices of cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza Kate's friends will eat. Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza, so that's 6 x 6 = 36 slices. Since each pizza has 12 slices, we need to divide 36 by 12 to find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs. 36 ÷ 12 = 3.

Next, we need to find out how many slices of pepperoni pizza Kate's friends will eat. Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, so that's 6 x 4 = 24 slices. Since each pizza has 8 slices, we need to divide 24 by 8 to find out how many pepperoni pizzas Kate needs. 24 ÷ 8 = 3.

So, Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. To find the total number of pizzas, we add 3 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 miles x 3 days = 9 miles.

Then, he ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. That's 5 miles x 2 days = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"Let's figure out how long it will take Jay to make 60 snowballs.

Jay can make 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. To find out how many snowballs he makes per minute, we divide 20 by 60. That's 20 ÷ 60 = 1/3 snowball per minute.

But, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, we need to find out how many snowballs melt per minute. We divide 2 by 15, which is 2 ÷ 15 = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of snowballs Jay makes and the number that melt. To do this, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: 1/3 - 2/15. To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So, we rewrite 1/3 as 5/15. Now we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15.

So, Jay makes 3/15 snowballs per minute. To find out how many minutes it will take him to make 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by 3/15. To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: 60 × (15/3) = 60 × 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to make 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 300"
"So, Digimon just had its 20th anniversary. That means 20 years have passed since it came out. If John was twice as old as Jim when it came out, we need to figure out how old Jim is now.

Let's think about it: if John is 28 now, that means 20 years ago, he was 28 - 20 = 8 years old. Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, Jim must have been half of John's age at that time. So, Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old 20 years ago.

Now, to find Jim's current age, we just add 20 to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's figure out how many slices of apple they ate. Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add up the slices each person ate: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's figure out how many bandages they started with.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and got 50 more. That means they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had 12 bandages from the first day, so they had 12 + 28 = 40 bandages left.

On the third day, they used half a pack of bandages, which is 25 bandages. They also got 2 packs of 50 bandages, so they got 100 more bandages. They still had 40 bandages from the second day, so they had 40 + 100 - 25 = 115 bandages.

We know they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have had 115 - 78 = 37 bandages before they got the 2 packs of 50 bandages.

But wait, we know they had 12 bandages left after the first day. So, they must have had 12 + 25 = 37 bandages before they used half a pack on the third day.

Now, let's go back to the first day. They used 38 bandages and got 50 more. So, they must have had 38 + 50 = 88 bandages before they used 38 bandages.

The final answer is: 88"
"May is getting her hair cut and colored. It costs $40 for the color and $30 per inch of haircut. If her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, how much did her cut and color cost?

To find the total cost, we need to figure out how much the haircut cost. We know that her hair was 10 inches long at first and 8 inches long after the haircut. So, we need to find the difference in length.

10 inches (initial length) - 8 inches (final length) = 2 inches

Now, we know that the haircut costs $30 per inch. So, we multiply the number of inches by the cost per inch.

2 inches * $30/inch = $60

We also know that the color costs $40. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color.

$60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how much Jen will get paid, we need to know how many hours she works and how much she gets paid per hour. 

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. There are 4 weeks in April. So, she works 4 * 6 = 24 days in April. 

To find out how many hours she works in total, we multiply the hours she works per day by the number of days she works. 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours.

Jen gets paid $1.5 per hour. So, we multiply the total hours she works by her hourly rate. 180 * $1.5 = $270.

But Jen also gets a bonus if she doesn't miss any days. She gets $10 for each day she doesn't miss. Since she doesn't miss any days, she gets the bonus for all 24 days. 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, we add her regular pay and her bonus to find out how much she gets in total. $270 + $240 = $510.

The final answer is: $510"
"To find out how much money Jason earned, we need to add up the money he got for doing different tasks.

He got $3.00 for doing his laundry. He did it once, so that's $3.00.

He got $1.50 for cleaning his room. He did it once, so that's $1.50.

He got $0.75 for taking the trash out. He did it twice, so that's $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.

He got $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher. He did it 6 times, so that's $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up the money he got for all the tasks: $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00.

"So, let's figure this out. We know that a whale has 40 gallons of blood. And we also know that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. 

To find out how much blood a shark has, we multiply the amount of blood a whale has by 3. So, 40 * 3 = 120 gallons of blood in a shark.

Now, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We can do this by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by 10. So, 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, 50 people came in the morning. Then, 40 more people came at 10:00. After that, twice as many people as the ones who came at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 

Now, let's add up the people who came at 10:00 and the ones who came after that: 40 + 80 = 120 people. 

Now, we need to add the people who came in the morning and the ones who came at 10:00 and after that: 50 + 120 = 170 people. 

But we're not done yet. We also need to add the people who came in the evening, which is 3 times the number of people who came in the morning, so that's 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up all the people: 170 + 150 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"So, Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Each pack has 5 pens, so that's 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Then, she bought twice as many black pens as red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, she bought 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's figure out how much John spent on scotch and cognac.

John bought 10 bottles of scotch for $600. To find out how much one bottle costs, we need to divide the total cost by the number of bottles. So, $600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle.

Now, let's talk about the cognac. John bought twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which means he bought 2 * 10 = 20 bottles.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. To find out how much more it costs, we need to multiply the cost of the scotch by 50% (or 0.5). So, $60 * 0.5 = $30. Now, we add that to the cost of the scotch to get the cost of the cognac: $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

Now that we know the cost of one bottle of cognac, we can find the total cost of the cognac by multiplying the cost per bottle by the number of bottles: $90 * 20 = $1800.

To find the total cost of everything, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's figure out how many trees Mr. Julius planted. He planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day. Then, he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 x 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day. To find 1/4 of 40, we multiply 40 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 40 by 4. 40 ÷ 4 = 10. So, he planted 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. In total, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's add the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 30
Lodgepole Pine: 50

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days = 30 + 50 = 80

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's figure out how much root beer was left for the party.

Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day. Then, his kids drank 4 gallons, so we subtract 4 from 24, which is 20 gallons left.

But then, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so we subtract 7 from 20, which is 13 gallons left.

Next, his friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, so we subtract 5 from 13, which is 8 gallons left.

Now, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we need to divide 8 by 3.

8 ÷ 3 = 2.67

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's solve the problem. We are told that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40. This can be written as an equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To find the number of coffee mugs, we need to solve for x. First, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes, we need to do some math.

First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. We know that one-third of the fish have red stripes. To find one-third of 66, we can divide 66 by 3.

66 ÷ 3 = 22

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, let's find out how many fish have blue stripes. We know that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. To find the remaining fish, we need to subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

66 - 22 = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of 44.

To do this, we can multiply 44 by 5 and then divide by 11.

(44 * 5) = 220
220 ÷ 11 = 20

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes. We add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

22 + 20 = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's figure this out step by step. Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each. That's 2 x 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each. That's 3 x 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

So, in total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Then, her sister took one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Next, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set. There were 6 colors in that set, and half of 6 is 3. So, she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know Mattison is 60 inches tall. His house is two stories high, and it's 7 times as high as he is. So, we multiply 60 by 7 to find the total height of the house:
60 * 7 = 420 inches

Now, we know the first floor is 3 times as high as Mattison. We multiply 60 by 3 to find the height of the first floor:
60 * 3 = 180 inches

Since the house is 420 inches tall and the first floor is 180 inches, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the first floor's height from the total height of the house:
420 - 180 = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. To do that, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor, because the roof is above the second floor. 
180 - 240 is incorrect, we need to subtract the second floor's height from the first floor's height to get the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. 
240 - 180 = 60 inches"
"So, there are 700 shells in a parking lot. Team Alphas found 40% of them. To find 40% of 700, we multiply 700 by 0.4. 

0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find out how many shells are left. We subtract the shells found by Alphas from the total number of shells.

700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining shells. To find 60% of 420, we multiply 420 by 0.6.

0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find out how many shells Gogetters found. We subtract the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

700 - (280 + 252) = 700 - 532 = 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"Let's figure this out. We know that Bernie has 4 dogs. The first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second dog needs to walk 4 miles, and the third dog needs to walk 3 miles. We also know that on average, all 4 dogs need to walk 3 miles per day.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to know how many miles all 4 dogs need to walk in total. Since they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, we multiply the number of dogs by the average miles per day: 4 dogs * 3 miles = 12 miles.

Now, we need to find out how many miles the first three dogs walk in total. The first dog walks 1 mile, the second dog walks 4 miles, and the third dog walks 3 miles. So, 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all 4 dogs: 12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

The last dog needs 4 miles."
"So John wants to get a loan to pay off his debts. His house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan for 40% of that amount. 

To find 40% of $250,000, we multiply 0.4 by $250,000. That's 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000. 

Now, John uses 60% of this $100,000 to pay off his debts. To find 60% of $100,000, we multiply 0.6 by $100,000. That's 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000.

So, John used $60,000 to pay off his debts. To find out how much money he has leftover, we subtract $60,000 from $100,000. That's $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's figure out how much Deandre will earn from selling the tunas.

Deandre caught 3 tunas. The first one weighs 56 kilograms, the second one weighs 46 kilograms, and the last one weighs 26 kilograms. We need to find the total weight of all the tunas.

First, we add the weights of the three tunas together: 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Now, we know that a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50. To find out how much Deandre will earn, we multiply the total weight of the tunas by the cost per kilogram: 128 * 0.50 = 64.

So, Deandre will earn $64 from selling the tunas.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to know how much she sold the magazines for and how much she bought them for. 

She bought the magazines for $72. To find out how much she sold them for, we need to multiply the cost by 11/8. 

First, let's multiply 72 by 11:
72 * 11 = 792

Now, we need to divide 792 by 8:
792 / 8 = 99

So, Trinity sold the magazines for $99. To find her profit, we subtract the cost from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"So, Brian has a dehumidifier that can work on three different speeds: low, medium, and high. The low setting removes 1 liter of water from the air per day. The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day. The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.

Brian used the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so it removed 3 liters of water. Then, he used it for 3 days on the medium setting, so it removed 6 liters of water. Finally, he used it for 5 days on the high setting, so it removed 20 liters of water.

To find the total amount of water removed, we add the water removed on each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to know how many balloons Jolene and her friends started with and how many were left.

They filled up 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons. So, we multiply 10 packs by 30 balloons per pack to get the total number of balloons: 10 * 30 = 300.

Now, we know they had 300 balloons and 12 were left. To find out how many were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total: 300 - 12 = 288.

The final answer is: 288"
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to multiply the first medicine by 3. The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

"So, let's figure this out. Ali is a teacher at a private school, and he has one class. But John is a teacher at a public school, and he has two classes. Now, we need to find out how many students can fit in each of John's classes.

We know that Ali's class can fit 120 students. Now, we need to find out how many students can fit in one of John's classes. If one of John's classes is 1/8 the size of Ali's class, that means it's 1/8 of 120. To find 1/8 of 120, we can divide 120 by 8. 

120 divided by 8 is 15. So, one of John's classes can fit 15 students. Since John has two classes, we need to multiply 15 by 2 to find out how many students can fit in both of his classes. 

15 * 2 is 30. So, John's two classes can fit 30 students.

Now, we need to find the total number of students that can fit in both schools. We already know that Ali's class can fit 120 students, and John's classes can fit 30 students. To find the total, we add 120 and 30 together.

120 + 30 is 150.

"Let's figure out how much Stephen will pay his sister in the twelfth month.

First, we need to find out how much interest Stephen owes his sister. To do this, we need to find 2% of $300. 2% is the same as 2/100, so we multiply 300 by 2/100.

300 * 2/100 = 6

So, Stephen owes his sister $6 in interest.

Next, we need to find out how much Stephen will pay his sister in the first 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so we multiply 25 by 11.

25 * 11 = 275

Now, we need to find out how much Stephen will pay his sister in the twelfth month. To do this, we add the interest to the initial amount and subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months.

300 + 6 - 275 = 31

"Let's figure this out. Jordan has 2 kids, and each kid needs 5 diaper changes per day. So, we multiply the number of kids by the number of diaper changes per day: 2 kids * 5 diaper changes = 10 diaper changes.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers. That means Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 diapers.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"Let's figure out how many red jelly beans are in the jar. First, we need to find the total volume of the jar. The jar is a square, so it has the same length and width. It's 6 inches by 6 inches, and it's 15 inches tall. To find the volume, we multiply the length, width, and height.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Now, we know that the jelly beans are packed in the jar with 80% efficiency. This means that the jelly beans take up 80% of the total volume of the jar. To find the actual volume used by the jelly beans, we multiply the total volume by 0.8.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. To find the total number of jelly beans, we divide the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

The problem says that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know what his guess was. Since we don't know his guess, we'll assume he guessed the correct number of red jelly beans, which is 864.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, the bus had 20 people on it. Then, 40 people got on at the first stop, so now there are 20 + 40 = 60 people on the bus.

Next, at the second stop, 3/4 of the people who got on at the first stop got on the bus. Since 3/4 of 40 is 30, now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people on the bus.

Then, at the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubled. So, now there are 2 x 90 = 180 people on the bus.

The bus can hold 200 people, and there are already 180 people on it. To find out how many more people can get on, we need to subtract 180 from 200. 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's figure out how much money Pauline spent on visiting the museum.

First, we need to find out how much she spent in the first 5 years. Since she visits the museum 3 times a year, and each visit costs $2, she spends 3 * $2 = $6 per year. So, in 5 years, she spent 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's see what happens after 5 years. The cost of one visit increases by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. Since she still visits 3 times a year, she now spends 3 * $5 = $15 per year. For the next 3 years, she spent 3 * $15 = $45.

To find the total amount she spent, we add the money she spent in the first 5 years and the money she spent in the next 3 years. So, $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To figure out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to know how many groups of 8 students can be made from the total number of students. 

There are 4 grades at Cedar Falls Middle School, and each grade has 10 students. So, the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many groups can be formed: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, and there are 5 groups, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"So John made 4 tables for his friend Ali. Each table costs $20. To find the total cost of the tables, we multiply the number of tables by the cost per table. 

4 tables * $20 per table = $80

John also made 2 roof frames for Ali. Each roof frame costs $10. To find the total cost of the roof frames, we multiply the number of frames by the cost per frame.

2 frames * $10 per frame = $20

Now, we need to add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay John.

$80 + $20 = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"Let's say Ian has a board that's 40 feet long. He wants to cut it into two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. We need to find out how long the longer piece is.

Let's call the shorter piece ""x"". Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it's divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

We can combine like terms by adding x and 4x:

5x = 40

Now, we need to get x by itself. To do that, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 40 / 5
x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8)
4x = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to know how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now, we need to find out how much seasoning Aiden needs for 5 pounds of meat. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. So, we multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"So, Luke is buying fabric for his curtains. He has 5 windows, and each one is 35 inches wide. He wants to buy fabric that's 2 times the total width of all the windows.

First, we need to find the total width of all the windows. We do this by multiplying the width of one window by the number of windows. 

35 inches (width of one window) * 5 (number of windows) = 175 inches

Now, we need to multiply the total width by 2, because Luke wants 2 times the total width.

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To find the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts. 

First, we need to find the cost for the first 16 minutes. Since it costs $0.25 per minute, we multiply 16 by $0.25. That's 16 x $0.25 = $4.

Next, we need to find the cost for the remaining 20 minutes. Since the price drops to $0.2 per minute after 16 minutes, we multiply 20 by $0.2. That's 20 x $0.2 = $4.

Now, we add the two costs together to get the total cost. $4 + $4 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much rain there will be on Tuesday, we need to know how much it rained on Monday and how much it will rain on Tuesday.

It rained 2 inches on Monday. Now, we need to figure out how much it will rain on Tuesday. It's expected to rain 1 more inch than twice the amount of Monday's total. 

First, we need to find twice the amount of Monday's total. Twice of 2 is 2 x 2 = 4 inches. 

Now, we need to add 1 more inch to that. 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

So, there will be 5 inches of rain on Tuesday."
"Let's figure out how many cupcakes Carly made.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we say the number of cupcakes is x, then the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

Each person in Carly's class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies. We can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation: 
x + 3x - 2 = 10
4x - 2 = 10
4x = 12
x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find out how much Karen will pay, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art.

The manicure costs $35, but there's a 20% discount. To find 20% of 35, we multiply 35 by 0.2, which is 7. So the discount is $7. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the cost of the manicure: $35 - $7 = $28.

The pedicure costs $40, and there's also a 20% discount. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which is 8. So the discount is $8.

Now, we subtract the discount from the cost of the pedicure: $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Now, let's talk about the nail art. Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers. Each nail art costs $3, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Let's figure out how many magazines Susan gets every year. 

She has 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each. That's 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

Then, she has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.

And, she has another magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. That's 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings. We also know that she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. To find out how many paintings Shelley has, we need to add 12 to 27. 

27 + 12 = 39

So, Shelley has 39 paintings. Now, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from 39.

39 - 8 = 31

So, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to do some math.

First, we need to find the price of the toy in December. The price increased by 80% from $40. To find 80% of $40, we multiply 40 by 0.8 (since 80% is the same as 80/100 or 0.8). 

0.8 * 40 = 32
So, the price increased by $32. Now, we add this to the original price of $40.
40 + 32 = 72

Now, we need to find the price of the toy in January. The price decreased by 50% from $72. To find 50% of $72, we multiply 72 by 0.5 (since 50% is the same as 50/100 or 0.5).

0.5 * 72 = 36
So, the price decreased by $36. Now, we subtract this from the price in December, which is $72.
72 - 36 = 36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"Let's figure out how much money Charlie will make from his tennis lessons. He has 4 lessons at his regular price of $80 per hour, and 2 lessons at a lower price for a veteran.

First, let's find out how much money he makes from the regular price lessons. We multiply the number of lessons by the price per lesson: 4 * $80 = $320.

Now, let's find out how much money he makes from the lower price lessons. The veteran gets a 25% discount, which means he pays 75% of the regular price. To find 75% of $80, we multiply $80 by 0.75: $80 * 0.75 = $60. Now, we multiply the number of lessons by the lower price: 2 * $60 = $120.

To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we add the money from the regular price lessons and the lower price lessons: $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630. There are 9 scores in total.

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's solve the problem.

Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. 

To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we need to figure out what 1/4 of 20 is. We can do this by multiplying 20 by 1/4. 

20 * (1/4) = 5

This means Eve is left with 5 pomelos. Since she originally had 20, the number of pomelos she gave away is the difference between the original amount and the remaining amount.

20 - 5 = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Walter bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them. To find out how many apples he ate, we need to multiply 60 by 2/5.

First, we multiply 60 by 2: 60 * 2 = 120

Then, we divide 120 by 5: 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples.

Now, we need to find out how many apples are left. We subtract the apples he ate from the total: 60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25 (which is the same as 25/100).

36 * 0.25 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we need to find out how many apples are left: 36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he got, we multiply 27 by 3.

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: $81"
"Let's figure this out. Regina wrote 9 novels last year. We know that's 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. To find out how many novels she wrote this year, we need to find out what 1 quarter is and then multiply it by 4.

If 9 is 3 quarters, then 1 quarter is 9 divided by 3.

9 ÷ 3 = 3

Now, we multiply 3 by 4 to find the total number of novels she wrote this year.

3 * 4 = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year."
"Let's figure out how far Michael traveled in 3 days. We know he drives 50 km per hour, and there are 24 hours in a day. So, in 3 days, he drives 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Now, let's multiply his speed by the number of hours he drove: 50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km.

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find out what percentage of the distance Michael covered, we need to divide the distance he traveled by the total distance and multiply by 100.

(3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 0.6 * 100 = 60%

So, Michael covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas."
"Let's figure out how many grapes were there at the beginning.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 x 5 = 30 grapes.

Now, let's add the grapes Madeline and her brother used: 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mom used the remaining grapes to make pies. Each pie needs 12 grapes, and she made 3 pies. So, she used 3 x 12 = 36 grapes.

We know that the total number of grapes used is 36 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) + 36 (by their mom) = 102 grapes.

Since the total number of grapes used is 102, that means there were 102 grapes at the beginning.

The final answer is: 102"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to know how many teachers were not sick and how many substitute teachers were there.

There were 82 teachers in total, and 13 of them were sick. So, the number of teachers who were not sick is 82 - 13 = 69.

Now, we know that 9 substitute teachers were called in to help. To find the total number of teachers at school, we add the number of teachers who were not sick to the number of substitute teachers: 69 + 9 = 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find out how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in a year, we need to know how much it costs him to make it one time. 

The pasta costs $1.00 per box. 
The cheddar cheese costs $3.00. 
The gruyere cheese costs twice as much as the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

So, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese one time is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the cost of making macaroni and cheese one time by 52. 

$10.00 * 52 = $520.00

The final answer is: $520.00"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we need to know how many classrooms the custodian has to clean. There are 80 classrooms.

Next, we need to know how much time they have to clean them. They have 5 days to do it, and they work 8 hours a day. So, they have 5 x 8 = 40 hours.

Now, let's find out how long it takes to clean one classroom. It takes them 15 minutes per classroom. To find the total time, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time per classroom: 80 x 15 = 1200 minutes.

To make it easier to work with, let's convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 1200 by 60: 1200 ÷ 60 = 20 hours.

Now, we need to find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning classrooms. To do this, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiply by 100: (20 / 40) * 100 = 50%.

"Let's figure out how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all her books. 

Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up how many books one bookcase can hold: 
Middle shelf 1 + Middle shelf 2 + Bottom shelf + Top shelf = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Elly has 110 books, and we need to find out how many bookcases are needed to hold all of them. To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 
110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"Let's figure out how much profit Rose will make.

First, we need to find out how much Rose paid for the eggs. She bought 5 dozen eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. 

5 * $2.40 = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's find out how much money Rose will make from selling the eggs. She sells 3 eggs for $1. 

60 eggs / 3 eggs = 20 sets

Since she sells each set for $1, the total money she will make is:

20 * $1 = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the money she made:

Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"Let's figure out how many white hats Skyler has. 

First, we need to find out how many hats are red. Since half of the hats are red, we multiply 100 by 0.5 (which is the same as dividing by 2). So, 100 * 0.5 = 50 hats are red.

Now, we need to find out how many hats are left. We subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats: 100 - 50 = 50 hats left.

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining hats are blue. We know that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find 3/5 of 50, we multiply 50 by 3 and then divide by 5. So, 50 * 3 = 150, and then 150 / 5 = 30. 

Now, we know that 30 hats are blue and 50 hats are left. To find out how many hats are white, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

So, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"Let's figure out how much each stick of jerky costs. 

First, we need to find out how much the bag costs after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, we subtract the discount from the original price: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Now, we need to convert the price to cents because we want to know the cost per stick in cents. To do that, we multiply the price by 100: $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents.

Next, we need to find out how much each stick costs. There are 30 sticks in a bag, and the total cost is 1500 cents. To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost by the number of sticks: 1500 / 30 = 50 cents.

"Let's say Mary makes some strawberry ice cubes and some blueberry ice cubes. We know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes, minus 4. If Mary makes a total of 116 ice cubes, how many blueberry cubes does she make?

Let's call the number of strawberry cubes ""S"" and the number of blueberry cubes ""B"". We know that B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

We can substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Now, let's simplify the equation: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Now, divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry ice cubes.

"So, let's figure out how many candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out. 

First, we need to count the flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, there are 4 flashlights.

Now, let's count the candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The rooms with small candles have 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.
The rooms with medium candles have 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Now, we add the small and medium candles together: 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets. There are 5 family members.

110 chips ÷ 5 family members = 22 chips per person

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To find out how long it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to add up the time it takes for each side. 

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each. 
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:

Next, let's find out how much water the plants that need 1 cup need. There are 8 of these plants, so 8 x 1 = 8 cups.

Now, let's find out how much water the rest of the plants need. There are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants left. These plants need a quarter of a cup of water each, so 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add up all the water needed: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's figure out how long it will take Phineas to get back home. He's 200 yards away from his home in the swamp, and he needs to hop and swim his way back.

Since he has to cover half of the distance on land and the other half in water, we need to find the distance for each part. Half of 200 yards is 100 yards.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Phineas to cover each part. On land, he hops at 20 yards per minute. So, to cover 100 yards, it will take him 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

In the water, he swims at 10 yards per minute. To cover 100 yards, it will take him 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the time it takes for each part: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how much it will cost Bob to build his project, we need to know how many boxes of popsicle sticks he needs to buy. 

We know that Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box has 8 sticks. To find out how many boxes he needs, we can divide 56 by 8.

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. Now, we need to find out how much 7 boxes will cost. Each box costs $2.00.

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

The final answer is: $14.00"
"Let's figure out how much the whole phone plan costs.

We know there are five phones on the plan. The main phone costs twice as much as each of the other phones. If the main phone costs $20, we need to find out how much the other phones cost.

Let's call the cost of each of the other phones ""x"". Since the main phone costs twice as much as each of the other phones, the main phone costs 2x.

We know the main phone costs $20, so we can write an equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each of the other phones is $10, we can find the total cost of the other phones. There are 4 other phones, so the total cost of the other phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the other phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"
"Derrick's bakery makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. We need to figure out how many doughnuts that is. Since 1 dozen is 12, we multiply 10 by 12 to get 120 doughnuts.

Each doughnut costs $2. So, if Derrick sells 120 doughnuts, he makes 120 * $2 = $240.

June has 30 days. To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we multiply the money he makes in a day by the number of days in June. That's $240 * 30 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"
"Jade took 210 photos and she wants to upload them on Instagram. She can upload 6 batches of 7 photos each day. To find out how many days it will take her to upload all the photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day.

First, let's find out how many photos she can upload per day. She uploads 6 batches of 7 photos each day, so that's 6 x 7 = 42 photos per day.

Now, let's divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day: 210 / 42 = 5.

So, it will take Jade 5 days to upload all her photos."
"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning, we need to add up the cost of all her clothes. 

She has 5 blouses, and each one costs $5.00. So, the total cost for blouses is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

She has 1 skirt, and it costs $6.00. So, the total cost for the skirt is $6.00.

She has 2 pairs of pants, and each pair costs $8.00. So, the total cost for pants is 2 x $8.00 = $16.00.

Now, we add up the cost of all her clothes: $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00. This is how much she spends on dry-cleaning each week.

To find out how much she spends in 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5: $47.00 x 5 = $235.00.

The final answer is: $235.00"
"So, John wants to talk really fast. He can talk 150 words per minute normally. After he practices, he can talk 2.5 times faster than that. 

To find out how fast he can talk now, we multiply 150 by 2.5. 

150 * 2.5 = 375

So, John can talk 375 words per minute now. 

Now, we need to find out how many words are in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words. 

10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

Now, we need to find out how long it takes John to talk 4500 words. We divide the total number of words by how many words he can talk per minute. 

4500 words / 375 words per minute = 12 minutes

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's figure out how many people Conor saw at the beach that week.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach. The next day, 20 more people were there, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the number of people doubled from the second day, so Conor saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

So, on the first three days, Conor saw a total of 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, he saw 60 * 4 = 240 people on those days.

To find the total number of people Conor saw that week, we add the people he saw on the first three days to the people he saw on the remaining days: 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"Let's figure out how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has. 

First, 20 kernels popped in the first 30 seconds. Then, three times that amount popped in the next 30 seconds, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels. 

Next, four times the initial popping rate popped in the next 30 seconds, so that's 4 * 20 = 80 kernels. 

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels.

After Garrett took the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so that's 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

The final answer is: 210"
"To make lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice for every gallon. He's making 4 gallons for the party and 1 extra gallon for his friend Allen, but this extra gallon needs to be twice as tart. 

First, let's figure out how many cups of lemon juice Tim needs in total. Since he's making 5 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice, he needs 5 cups of juice.

Now, the extra gallon needs to be twice as tart, so it needs 2 cups of juice. This means Tim needs 2 cups of juice for the extra gallon and 3 cups of juice for the other 4 gallons. 

To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we need to know that 6 lemons give 1 cup of juice. So, for the extra gallon, he needs 2 cups of juice, which is 2 * 6 = 12 lemons. For the other 4 gallons, he needs 3 cups of juice, which is 3 * 6 = 18 lemons.

In total, Tim needs 12 + 18 = 30 lemons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much dog food the Kennel house needs in a week, we need to know how much each type of dog eats and how many dogs there are.

There are 3 German Shepherds. Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food per day. So, 3 German Shepherds eat 3 x 5 = 15 kilograms of dog food per day.

There are 2 Bulldogs. Each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of dog food per day. So, 2 Bulldogs eat 2 x 3 = 6 kilograms of dog food per day.

Now, we add the food eaten by the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs. 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms of dog food per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 21 kilograms by 7. 21 x 7 = 147 kilograms.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's count the legs of the animals on the farm. We have 10 animals that have 2 legs each, and 15 animals that have 4 legs each.

First, let's count the legs of the 2-legged animals. Since each of them has 2 legs, we multiply 10 animals by 2 legs per animal. That's 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Next, let's count the legs of the 4-legged animals. Since each of them has 4 legs, we multiply 15 animals by 4 legs per animal. That's 15 x 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the legs of the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals together. 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs.

Since we want to know the number of pairs of legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2. 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's figure out how many red blocks are in the tower. We know there are 4 blue blocks. There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks.

Now, we add the blue and yellow blocks together: 4 + 8 = 12 blocks.

Since there are 32 blocks in total, we need to find out how many blocks are left for the red blocks. We subtract the blue and yellow blocks from the total: 32 - 12 = 20

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's figure out how far Elvis is from his house. 

First, we need to find out how far he traveled when he drove west. To do this, we multiply the speed by the time. Elvis drove at 18 miles per hour for 5 hours, so we multiply 18 * 5. That's 90 miles.

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled when he drove east. Again, we multiply the speed by the time. Elvis drove at 18 miles per hour for 8 hours, so we multiply 18 * 8. That's 144 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances. We subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east. 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house."
"To find out how much the boat is worth after three years, we need to calculate how much it loses value each year.

The boat costs $9000. In the first year, it loses 30% of its value. To find 30% of $9000, we multiply $9000 by 0.3. That's $2700. So, after the first year, the boat is worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat loses another 30% of its value. To find 30% of $6300, we multiply $6300 by 0.3. That's $1890. So, after the second year, the boat is worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat loses 20% of its value. To find 20% of $4410, we multiply $4410 by 0.2. That's $882. So, after the third year, the boat is worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"Let's figure out how many pink candies are in the bag. We know there are 232 candies in total. 

We also know there are 54 red candies. The orange candies are twice as many as the red ones, so that's 2 x 54 = 108 orange candies.

Now, let's find out how many yellow candies there are. Since there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, that's 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

So, we have 54 red, 108 orange, and 27 yellow candies. Let's add those up: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.

Now, we need to find out how many pink candies there are. We know there are 232 candies in total, and we already know 189 of them are red, orange, or yellow. So, to find the number of pink candies, we subtract 189 from 232: 232 - 189 = 43.

The final answer is: 43"
"So, Helen went on a trip to Germany. She stayed in a hotel for 3 nights and took the bus 7 times. The hotel cost $80 per night, and the bus rides were 10% of that cost.

First, let's find out how much the hotel cost. If the hotel costs $80 per night and she stayed for 3 nights, we multiply 80 by 3. That's 80 x 3 = 240 dollars.

Now, let's find out how much the bus rides cost. The bus rides are 10% of the hotel cost, which is $80. To find 10% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.1. That's 80 x 0.1 = 8 dollars per bus ride. Since she took the bus 7 times, we multiply 8 by 7. That's 8 x 7 = 56 dollars.

So, the total cost of the hotel and bus rides is 240 + 56 = 296 dollars.

The final answer is: $296"
"Let's figure this out. Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins Dallas and Darla. We know that Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4 in the playground. To find out how many marbles he had before dropping any, we need to add the marbles he dropped back to the ones he has now.

21 (marbles Dallas has now) + 4 (marbles he dropped) = 25

So, Dallas had 25 marbles before dropping any. Now, we need to find out how many marbles Darla got. Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas got 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla got by subtracting 25 from 52.

52 - 25 = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."
"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of the tickets and the popcorns.

First, let's find the cost of the tickets. There are 2 adults and 1 child. The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $8. So, the total cost of the tickets is 2 * $12 + $8 = $24 + $8 = $32.

Next, let's find the cost of the popcorns. They bought 2 popcorns for $3 each, so the total cost of the popcorns is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $32 + $6 = $38.

"To find out how much force John needs to push the car, we need to know the total weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

The car weighs 1200 pounds. The luggage weighs 250 pounds. John's two children each weigh 75 pounds, so together they weigh 150 pounds.

Now, we add all these weights together to get the total weight.

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

The force to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600, we multiply 1600 by 0.01 (since 1% is the same as 0.01).

Force = 1600 * 0.01
Force = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To find out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to figure out the total distance around his backyard fence. Since the fence is a rectangle, we can use a formula to find the total distance.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

We know the length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. Let's plug those numbers into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we need to know their ages. We know that Mia is 40 years old and she is younger than Emma. Since they are 16 years apart in age, we can find Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age. 

Emma's age is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

Now, we need to find the average of their ages. To do this, we add their ages together and divide by 2. 

Mia's age + Emma's age = 40 + 56 = 96

Now, we divide the sum by 2: 96 / 2 = 48

The average age of Mia and Emma is 48.

Jake bought 2 T-shirts, but there's a deal where if you buy one, you get the second one for 50% off. So, Jake paid full price for one T-shirt, which is $8, and half price for the other one, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, we need to find out how much Jake paid for the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they're on sale for 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spent at the store: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"Let's figure out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy.

Ryan gets $6 each week when he does his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he got 6 * 3 = $18.

Then, he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each cone costs $1.25, so 4 cones cost 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from the money Ryan has: $18 - $5 = $13.

The movie tickets cost $6.50 each. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide the money he has by the cost of a ticket: $13 ÷ $6.50 = 2.

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find out how much Ellen and her sister Lani spent at the mall, we need to add up the cost of all the things they bought.

Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, we add those two numbers together: $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes for $100 each. We need to multiply the cost of the bathrobes by 2, because she bought two of them: $100 x 2 = $200. Then, we add the cost of the sunglasses to that: $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, we need to add the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani together: $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"To find out how much profit Tim makes selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to know how much it costs to make one jar and how much he sells it for.

It takes 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey to make one jar. The cost of these ingredients is:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

He sells each jar for $50. To find the profit from one jar, we subtract the cost from the selling price: $50 - $44 = $6.

Now, we need to find the profit from 10 jars. We multiply the profit from one jar by 10: $6 * 10 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's count the money in the jar. We have 32 quarters, 95 dimes, 120 nickels, and 750 pennies.

First, let's count the quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so 32 quarters are worth 32 x $0.25 = $8.

Next, let's count the dimes. Each dime is worth $0.10, so 95 dimes are worth 95 x $0.10 = $9.50.

Now, let's count the nickels. Each nickel is worth $0.05, so 120 nickels are worth 120 x $0.05 = $6.

Finally, let's count the pennies. Each penny is worth $0.01, so 750 pennies are worth 750 x $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add all the money together: $8 + $9.50 = $17.50, $17.50 + $6 = $23.50, and $23.50 + $7.50 = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's figure out how much money Janet has left after going to the mall.

First, we need to add up how much she spent. She spent $3.50 on ice cream. Then she bought two movie tickets for $7.50 each, so that's 2 x $7.50 = $15. Finally, she bought a bracelet for $8.50.

Now, let's add up all the money she spent: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27.

Her parents gave her $40, so we need to subtract the money she spent from the money her parents gave her. $40 - $27 = $13.

The final answer is: $13"
"Let's figure out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks.

Josh runs a car shop and he's open 5 days a week. He's not open on Sunday and Wednesday. That means he's open on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.

He services 3 cars a day and he gets paid $4 per car. So, in one day, he makes 3 * $4 = $12.

Since he's open 5 days a week, in one week, he makes 5 * $12 = $60.

In 2 weeks, he'll make 2 * $60 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's figure out how many cookies Randy has now.

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. That's a total of 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.

Randy eats 3 cookies for a snack, one of each flavor. So, he eats 3 cookies in total.

Then, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.

After that, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends.

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. That's 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies.

Now, let's count how many cookies Randy has left:
He started with 18 cookies.
He ate 3 cookies for a snack, 2 for lunch, and gave away 2, so that's 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 cookies gone.
He baked 12 new cookies.

To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to subtract the cookies he ate or gave away and add the cookies he baked. So, we do 18 - 7 + 12.

18 - 7 = 11
11 + 12 = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's figure out how much money Matthew would get if he sells his toy soldiers. He has 12 unique toy soldiers and wants to sell them for a fair price. He found a buyer who is willing to pay half of the price for 6 of the toy soldiers and a different price for the other 6.

The buyer is willing to pay $5 for each of the first 6 toy soldiers. So, we multiply 6 by $5 to find out how much he would get for those: 6 x $5 = $30.

The buyer is willing to pay $7 for each of the other 6 toy soldiers. So, we multiply 6 by $7 to find out how much he would get for those: 6 x $7 = $42.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"Let's figure out how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. 

First, we need to find out how many holes the dog dug while Nate was on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day, and Nate was on vacation for 14 days. 

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

But the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night, so we need to add those to the total. Since Nate was on vacation for 14 days, the dog dug 6 new holes for 14 nights.

6 holes/night * 14 nights = 84 holes

Now we add the holes dug during the day and the holes dug at night. 

84 holes + 84 holes = 168 holes

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. 

168 holes / 3 holes/day = 56 days

Since we want to know how many weeks it takes, we'll divide the total days by 7.

56 days / 7 days/week = 8 weeks

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to know how many students go to Butler High School. We know that Butler High School has 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. 

Norman High School has 4000 students. To find 3/4 of 4000, we can multiply 4000 by 3 and then divide by 4.

First, multiply 4000 by 3: 4000 * 3 = 12000
Then, divide 12000 by 4: 12000 / 4 = 3000

So, Butler High School has 3000 students. To find the difference in enrollment, we subtract the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

First, let's add the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies together: 2595 + 3075 = 5670.

Now, let's subtract that number from the total number of cookies: 7995 - 5670 = 2325.

So, the Adams family made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's figure out how many beakers Igor lost. 

Igor was supposed to get 16 test tubes, but he only got half of that, which is 8 test tubes. 

He was also supposed to get 14 Petri dishes, but he got 2 more than that, which is 16 - 2 = 14 - 2 = 12 Petri dishes.

Igor got the right number of beakers, which is 7 beakers.

So, let's add up the items Igor got: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 12 Petri dishes = 27 items.

But Igor had 29 items on the lab bench. That means he lost 29 - 27 = 2 beakers.

The answer is 2."
"Let's figure out how many screws James will have left over.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is making 4 tables, he needs a total of 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many he will have left over, we need to subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

So, James will have 8 screws left over.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's figure this out. We have 10 eggs in one basket. Now, we need to find out how many eggs are in the other basket. It says there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first basket. So, if the first basket has 10 eggs, the second basket has 2 times 10, which is 20 eggs.

Now, we need to add the eggs in both baskets together. We have 10 eggs in the first basket and 20 eggs in the second basket. So, 10 + 20 is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to figure out how much each girl raised and add it all together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra. Since Alexandra raises $430, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. Since Sarah raises $300, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the money each girl raised: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's figure out how long it took Vanessa to run her part of the race.

We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa. This means if Vanessa runs 1 mile in a certain number of minutes, Aaron runs 1 mile in half that time.

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. Since Aaron ran half the distance of Vanessa, that means Aaron ran 2 miles and Vanessa ran 4 miles.

We're told that Aaron ran his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since he runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile by dividing 16 minutes by 2. This is because Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so it takes him half the time to run the same distance.

16 minutes / 2 = 8 minutes

Now that we know it takes Aaron 8 minutes to run 1 mile, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, it takes Vanessa twice as long to run 1 mile. So, we multiply 8 minutes by 2.

8 minutes * 2 = 16 minutes

Therefore, it took Vanessa 16 minutes to run her part of the race.

The final answer is: 16"
"So, the caretaker needs to buy some new line for the docks. He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Right now, there's 200 feet of dock, and he already has 6 feet of new line.

To figure out how much line he needs, we need to multiply the length of the dock by 3. That's because he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. So, we do 200 feet * 3 feet/foot. That's 600 feet.

But wait, he already has 6 feet of line. So, we need to subtract that from the total amount of line he needs. That's 600 feet - 6 feet. 

The answer is 594 feet."
"Let's figure out how much money Tom's restaurant makes in a week.

They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation orders 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

First, we need to find out how much money they make in one night. They order 2 meals that cost $5 each, so that's 2 x $5 = $10. Then they order a $5 bottle of wine. So, in total, they make $10 + $5 = $15 per night.

Now, we need to find out how much they make in a week. They are open 2 days a week. So, we multiply the money they make in one night by 2. That's $15 x 2 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to know how much money the vendor made in total and how many watermelons he sold.

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. This means he spent $80 on the watermelons. He sold all of them at a profit of 25%. 

To find the total amount of money he made, we need to add 25% of $80 to $80. 25% of $80 is 0.25 x $80 = $20. So, the total amount of money he made is $80 + $20 = $100.

Now, we know he made $100 and he sold 50 watermelons. To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the number of watermelons he sold. 

$100 ÷ 50 = $2

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how old James is now. We know that his sister Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so right now she is 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

We also know that John had James when he was 19 years old. This means that 18 years have passed since then, but that's not possible because James is only 18 now. This means that John must have had James after he was 19, but that's not possible either. This is a problem with the information given.

However, let's just ignore this problem and move on. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. This means that his youngest son is 32 years old now. In 3 years, he will be 32 + 3 = 35 years old.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's say Ana and Jane are peeling oranges. Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange, and Jane takes 4 minutes. If they start peeling oranges at the same time, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after 1 hour.

First, let's see how many oranges Ana can peel in 1 hour. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, and Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange. So, we divide 60 by 3 to find out how many oranges Ana can peel in 1 hour. 60 / 3 is 20.

Now, let's see how many oranges Jane can peel in 1 hour. Jane takes 4 minutes to peel an orange, so we divide 60 by 4 to find out how many oranges Jane can peel in 1 hour. 60 / 4 is 15.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of oranges Ana and Jane peeled. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled. 20 - 15 is 5.

So, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after 1 hour."
"So Mark's car broke down and he needed a new radiator. He went to a junk shop and got it for a really good deal. The radiator originally cost $400, but he got it for 80% off. That means he paid 20% of the original price. To find 20% of 400, I multiply 400 by 0.2. That's 400 x 0.2 = 80. So Mark paid $80 for the radiator.

Next, he had to pay a mechanic to install it. The mechanic worked for 3 hours and charged $50 an hour. To find the total labor cost, I multiply 3 hours by $50. That's 3 x 50 = $150.

Now, I add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total. 80 + 150 = 230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, and they are either chickens or cows. We also know that all the animals together have 70 legs.

Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. Let's say the number of chickens is C and the number of cows is W. We can write two equations:

1. C + W = 20 (since there are 20 animals in total)
2. 2C + 4W = 70 (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and there are 70 legs in total)

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Now, let's substitute this expression for W into the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

The final answer is: 5"
"So, Henry and his friends want to share 7 pizzas that are cut into 8 slices each. To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, so we multiply 7 by 8. That's 7 x 8 = 56 slices in total.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). So, we divide 56 by 4.

56 ÷ 4 = 14

So, each person can have 14 slices."
