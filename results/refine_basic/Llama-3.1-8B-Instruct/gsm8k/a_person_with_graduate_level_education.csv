"To determine Janet's daily earnings from selling eggs at the farmers' market, we must first calculate the number of eggs she has available for sale after accounting for her personal consumption and baking.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking, resulting in a total of 7 eggs utilized. 

The number of eggs available for sale is then calculated as the difference between the total number of eggs laid and the number used: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Given that Janet sells each egg for $2, her daily earnings from the farmers' market can be calculated as the product of the number of eggs sold and the selling price per egg: 9 * 2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber needed. The problem states that 2 bolts of blue fiber are required, and the amount of white fiber is half that amount.

Since the amount of white fiber is half the amount of blue fiber, we can express this as a ratio: 2:1 (blue: white). To find the amount of white fiber, we divide the amount of blue fiber by 2.

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we can find the total number of bolts by adding the blue and white fiber together.

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house was $80,000, and Josh invested $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%.

The new value of the house can be calculated as follows:

New value = Original value + (Original value * 150%)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

The total cost of the house is the sum of the original price and the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To determine the total distance James covers in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a single sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Given that James runs 3 sprints in a session, with each sprint being 60 meters, the total distance covered in a single session is the product of the number of sprints and the distance per sprint, which is 3 * 60 = 180 meters.

Since James engages in this sprint routine 3 times a week, the total distance he covers in a week is the product of the distance covered in a single session and the number of sessions, which is 180 * 3 = 540 meters.

Therefore, the total distance James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we must first calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon. 

The morning feed consists of 15 cups, and the afternoon feed consists of 25 cups. Therefore, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per meal, and Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

To find the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the glasses, we can use a geometric series formula. The first term (a) is $5, the common ratio (r) is 0.6, and the number of terms (n) is 16.

The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Plugging in the values, we get: S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)

"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we can establish a hierarchical relationship between the cities based on the given information.

Seattle is the base city with 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, which means Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse, in turn, has twice as many sheep as Charleston, resulting in 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, to find the total number of sheep, we sum the number of sheep in each city: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To determine the total time it takes to download the file, we need to consider the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. The file is 200 GB, and Carla can download 2 GB per minute. Therefore, the time it takes to download 80 GB (40% of 200 GB) is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Next, we need to account for the time it takes to install the updates, which is given as 20 minutes.

Finally, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. The remaining 60% of the file is 120 GB (0.6 * 200 GB), and Carla can download 2 GB per minute. Therefore, the time it takes to download 120 GB is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each segment of his trip and then subtract the total distance from the initial distance.

First, let's calculate the distance John traveled in the first 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Next, we need to calculate the distance John traveled in the first 2 hours of the return trip in standstill traffic. Since he is not moving, the distance is 0 miles.

Then, we calculate the distance John traveled in the next half-hour at a speed of 30 mph.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

Finally, we calculate the distance John traveled in the remaining 2 hours of the return trip at a speed of 80 mph.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled in the return trip.

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 160 = 175 miles

However, we are interested in the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours. To find this, we need to consider the distance he has traveled in the 4 hours.

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles

Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles."
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings can be calculated as the product of her hourly rate and the number of hours worked. Given that her hourly rate is $10, her earnings for the first 40 hours are 40 * $10 = $400.

For the overtime hours, we need to consider her overtime pay rate, which is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. Therefore, her overtime pay rate is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. Since she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime, her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

To find her total earnings for the week, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours: $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and sum them together.

The first month's downloads were 60.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which is 3 * 60 = 180.

For the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find the reduction, we calculate 30% of 180, which is 0.3 * 180 = 54. Subtracting this from the second month's downloads, we get 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we sum the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To determine the total cost of the pastries Toula purchased, we must first calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum these values.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204. This is because the cost per dozen is $68, and we have 3 dozen units.

Similarly, the cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160. The cost per dozen is $80, and we have 2 dozen units.

Lastly, the cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330. The cost per dozen is $55, and we have 6 dozen units.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost of the pastries Toula purchased is $694."
"To determine the number of years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a revenue of $10.5 per year. Additionally, the annual maintenance cost is $3.

The net revenue each year is the difference between the revenue and the maintenance cost, which is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

To find the break-even point, we divide the initial cost by the net revenue:

$90 / $7.5 = 12 years

However, this calculation indicates the time it takes for the tree to pay for itself, not when it starts generating a profit. Since the tree generates revenue in the first year, we can conclude that it starts earning money in the first year.

Therefore, the correct answer is that it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself, but it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. After this sale, she had 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left.

She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This can be expressed as (1/2)(2x/3 - 2), which simplifies to x/3 - 1.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 yields x = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students. Then, 25% of these 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Therefore, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the optimal purchase choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each option. 

The increase in value for the jewelry is 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * $5,000 = $125. 

The increase in value for the electronic gadgets is 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Since the jewelry has a higher potential increase in value, the merchant should choose the jewelry.

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125.

The final answer is: $125"
"To determine the distance covered by each train over the two-day period, we can utilize the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this scenario, the two days of travel can be considered as the legs of a right-angled triangle, with the total distance covered by each train being the hypotenuse.

Given that the trains travel 80 miles westward on the first day and 150 miles northward on the second day, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem as follows:

cÂ² = aÂ² + bÂ²
cÂ² = 80Â² + 150Â²
cÂ² = 6400 + 22500
cÂ² = 28900
c = âˆš28900
c = 170 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train over the two-day period is 170 miles."
"To determine Jill's annual salary, we must first calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately, and then sum these values to obtain her total annual compensation.

First, we calculate her earnings from teaching. Given that she is paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours per week, her weekly earnings from teaching are $20 * 35 = $700. Since she works 50 weeks per year, her annual earnings from teaching are $700 * 50 = $35,000.

Next, we calculate her earnings from coaching. With a coaching hourly wage of $30 and 15 hours worked per week, her weekly earnings from coaching are $30 * 15 = $450. Over the course of 50 weeks, her annual earnings from coaching are $450 * 50 = $22,500.

To find Jill's total annual salary, we sum her earnings from teaching and coaching: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in that time frame. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days. 

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, the total number of eggs she will eat in 28 days is 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

To convert this to dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen. 

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

Therefore, Claire will consume 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the speed at which Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the hike. Given that she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can use the formula:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, we can find the remaining time by subtracting the time spent from the total time:

Remaining time = Total time - Time spent
Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours
Remaining time = 1 hour

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles. To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve her desired average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the original mixture and then subtract the amount of water that was lost due to spilling.

First, let's find the amount of water in the orange drink. Since it is two-thirds water, we can calculate this as (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Next, we find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it is three-fifths water, we can calculate this as (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in the original mixture is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks, which is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

However, 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, which means we need to subtract 1 liter of water from the total amount of water. This leaves us with 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters of water.

Now, we need to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, and we have 14.67 liters of water, the remaining amount of non-water liquid is 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange and pineapple drinks. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"To determine the number of years that have passed since Raymond's son was born, we first need to establish Raymond's current age. Given that Samantha is 31 years old and Raymond was born 6 years before her, we can calculate Raymond's age as 31 - 6 = 25 years.

Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we can now calculate the number of years that have elapsed since his son's birth by subtracting the age at which he had a son from his current age: 25 - 23 = 2 years.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we can break down the sales into distinct groups based on the number of DVDs purchased by each group of customers.

The first 3 customers each purchased 1 DVD, resulting in a total of 3 DVDs sold to this group. 

The next 2 customers each purchased 2 DVDs, resulting in a total of 4 DVDs sold to this group.

Since the last 3 customers did not purchase any DVDs, their purchases do not contribute to the total number of DVDs sold.

Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is the sum of the DVDs sold to the first two groups, which is 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total reduction in the candle's length, we need to calculate the product of the melting rate and the duration of burning.

Given that the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, and it burns for 4 hours (from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), we can calculate the total reduction as follows:

Total reduction = melting rate * duration
Total reduction = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total reduction = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To determine the original price of the book, we can use the concept of percentage decrease. The discounted price of the book is $19.50, which is 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% discount = 75%). 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

Therefore, the original price of the book is $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we can first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased, excluding the pizza boxes. The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 = $15, and the cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 = $6. Therefore, the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Given that Marie paid a total of $50, we can find the cost of the pizza boxes by subtracting the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount paid: $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can calculate the number of boxes by dividing the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on clothing items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them together.

First, we calculate the cost of the shorts: 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pants: 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

Lastly, we calculate the cost of the shoes: 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each is 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, we sum the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To determine the total expenditure on ice cream, we first need to calculate the number of cartons Cynthia purchases. Given that each carton contains 15 servings and she consumes one serving per night, we can calculate the total number of cartons required over a 60-day period.

The number of cartons can be found by dividing the total number of days (60) by the number of servings per carton (15):
60 days / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we can calculate the total expenditure by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton ($4.00):
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia's total expenditure on ice cream over 60 days is $16.00.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance between the two points. 

We know that Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles.

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we can find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

Therefore, the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops is 15 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. Given that the less expensive pair costs $33, we can express the cost of the more expensive pair as 2 * 33 = $66.

Since the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots, we can set up the following equation: B = 33 + 66 - 5, where B represents the cost of the boots.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $94.

The final answer is: $94"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a constant representing the ratio between their ages.

Given that their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms, we get: 18x = 162

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 18: x = 162 / 18

x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Allen's current age by substituting x into the expression for his age: 11x = 11 * 9

Allen's current age is 99 years.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and then divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans. The second person's guess is 20 more than half of the first one, which is 40 + 20 = 60. The third person's guess is 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we calculate the total number of guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. There are 3 people.

To find the average, we divide the total number of guesses by the number of people: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to calculate the daily time commitment and then extrapolate it to a weekly basis.

First, we establish the daily time commitment by multiplying the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog. 

Number of dogs: 10
Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Daily time commitment = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Daily time commitment = 10 * 0.5
Daily time commitment = 5 hours

Next, we calculate the weekly time commitment by multiplying the daily time commitment by the number of days in a week.

Number of days in a week: 7

Weekly time commitment = Daily time commitment * Number of days in a week
Weekly time commitment = 5 * 7
Weekly time commitment = 35 hours

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of dogs.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30, as there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Additionally, we are given that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

We can substitute G = S + 30 into the second equation to obtain S + (S + 30) = 110. Simplifying this equation, we get 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides yields 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that S = 40.

Now that we have determined the value of S, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30. Therefore, G = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the number of jewels Siobhan possesses, we must first establish the relationship between the jewels owned by each individual.

Given that Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate the number of jewels Aaron has by determining half of Raymond's jewels and then adding 5 to that value. Half of 40 is 20, and adding 5 to this value yields 25 jewels for Aaron.

Now, we are informed that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, to find the number of jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total, resulting in 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the total points scored by Mike, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which equals 1 point. Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total expenditure on yogurts over a 30-day period, we first need to calculate the total number of yogurts consumed. Given that Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, the total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days is 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since the yogurts are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00, we can calculate the number of sets purchased by dividing the total number of yogurts by 4. This yields 60 / 4 = 15 sets.

Now, to find the total expenditure, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set, which is $5.00. Therefore, the total expenditure is 15 * $5.00 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

First, we calculate the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets. Since he sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, the total amount of money he made is:
13 * 15 = 195 dollars

Next, we calculate the total cost of the video games. John bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

We are also given that John has $5 left after buying the video games. This means that the total amount of money he spent on the video games and the remaining money is:
195 - 5 = 190 dollars

Now, we can find the amount of money John used to buy the video games:
190 = 160 (cost of video games) + x (amount of money John used to buy the video games)
x = 190 - 160
x = 30

This means John used $30 of his own money to buy the video games. Since he used $30 of his own money, he must have used the remaining money from the Lego sales to buy the video games.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $30. 
30 / 15 = 2

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 11 sets with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine John's running speed, we must first calculate his total running time per week. Given that he runs 3 days a week, with 3 hours on the first day and half that amount on the other two days, we can calculate his daily running time as follows:

The first day, John runs 3 hours. The other two days, he runs half of that, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Now, we can calculate his total weekly running time by summing the hours from each day: 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours. Since he runs 3 days a week, we multiply this by 3 to get his total weekly running time: 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours.

To find John's speed, we divide the total distance he runs per week (60 miles) by his total weekly running time (18 hours).

Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To determine the total distance Dana can travel in six hours, we first need to establish her walking and running speeds. Given that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour and it is half as fast as her running speed, we can deduce that her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can calculate her walking speed as 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Next, we need to calculate the time she spends walking and running. It is stated that she spends two-thirds of the time walking and one-third of the time running. Therefore, the time she spends walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours, and the time she spends running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while walking as 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running as 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can establish a series of relationships between the ages of the iPhones.

Let's denote Suzy's iPhone as S, Ben's iPhone as B, and Brandon's iPhone as Br. We are given the following information:

1. S = 1 year (Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old)
2. B = 2S (Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone)
3. Br = 4B (Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone)

Substituting the value of S from equation 1 into equation 2, we get:
B = 2(1) = 2 years

Now, substituting the value of B into equation 3, we get:
Br = 4(2) = 8 years

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while still hitting the dragon with the gold javelin, we need to consider the increased range provided by the sapphire gemstone.

The original range of the javelin is 400 feet. When Polly holds the gemstone, her range triples, resulting in a new range of 1200 feet.

Given that the dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet, Polly can stand at a distance of 1200 feet from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. To find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames, we subtract the range of the flames from the new range of the javelin.

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the gold javelin.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests, we can calculate the total number of pieces initially available and then subtract the number of pieces remaining.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces: 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

Next, we subtract the number of pieces remaining: 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces.

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the remaining daily calorie allowance, we first need to calculate the difference between the daily target and the calories already consumed. Given a daily target of 2000 calories and 1800 calories already consumed, the remaining allowance is 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Next, we need to find out how many servings of chips can be consumed within this remaining calorie allowance. Each serving of chips contains 250 calories. To find the number of servings, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag of chips contains 5 servings, we can now calculate the maximum weight of chips that can be consumed by multiplying the number of servings by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

Therefore, the maximum weight of chips that can be consumed is 240 grams."
"To determine Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we must first calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of the candles and the total cost incurred in producing them.

The total revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of candles sold by the price per candle. In this case, Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each.

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost incurred by Charlie. The cost consists of the cost of the beeswax and the wicks required to produce the candles. Since 1 pound of beeswax yields 10 candles, 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost of the beeswax is:

Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $10.00 per pound * 2
Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $20.00

The total cost is therefore $20.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This can be calculated as 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

The total number of articles written in 3 days is the sum of the articles written each day: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package can be expressed as:

80 (initial) + x (package) - 220 (used) + 23 (remaining)

This equation can be simplified to:

x + 23 = 80 + 220 - 23

Combining like terms, we get:

x + 23 = 277 - 23

Subtracting 23 from both sides of the equation yields:

x = 254

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 254.

The final answer is: $\boxed{254}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on ties, we first need to establish the number of blue ties and the cost of red ties.

Given that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John purchases twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which translates to 1.5 times the price of blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

The total cost of red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we first need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, we can calculate the total length of the wire in inches as follows:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces obtained:

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building. Given that there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, we can find the total number of units by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor: 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units, as 3/4 of the building is occupied. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: 120 units * 1/4 = 30 units.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we must first calculate the total number of eggs produced per week. Given that his chickens produce 252 eggs per day, we can find the weekly production by multiplying this daily rate by the number of days in a week.

Weekly egg production = 252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are typically sold in dozens, we must convert the total weekly production to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total weekly production by 12.

Weekly production in dozens = 1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, we can calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings by multiplying the number of dozens sold by the price per dozen. Given that he sells eggs for $2 per dozen, his weekly earnings are:

Weekly earnings = 147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To determine the total time Tom spent traveling, we must first calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spent traveling back.

The distance traveled during this time period is 3 hours, as the time elapsed is 3 hours. Given that Tom's ship can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour, the distance is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

The time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour is 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Now, we need to find the time it took to travel back. The distance is the same, 30 miles. Since Tom's ship can travel at 6 mph, the time it took to travel back is 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

The total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Given that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

The remaining weight to be removed from the book bag is 15 pounds, and since the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the weight of the toys to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys to be removed can be calculated by dividing the weight of the toys to be removed by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the revenue earned by the mechanic, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately for both Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is calculated as 6 * $60 = $360, and the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.

Comparing the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday, we find that Thursday's revenue ($520) is greater than Friday's revenue ($480).

To find the difference in revenue between the two days, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue. Therefore, the difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we must first calculate the number of kittens from the two house cats. 

Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens, Patchy has had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

The total number of kittens from the two house cats is 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 33.

Adding the 7 adopted kittens to this total, we get 33 + 7 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we first need to calculate the number of lollipops remaining after she eats 2. This can be done by subtracting the number of lollipops consumed from the initial total.

The initial number of lollipops is 30, and Jean eats 2, so the number of lollipops remaining is:
30 - 2 = 28

Next, we need to find out how many bags Jean can fill with the remaining lollipops. Since each bag contains 2 lollipops, we divide the number of remaining lollipops by 2.

28 / 2 = 14

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we first need to calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Subtracting the latter from the former yields the maximum weight that can be carried by the truck:

5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can find the maximum number of boxes by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:

1245 / 15 = 83

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

"To determine the total number of raspberries on the bush, we must first calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and then add the number of individual raspberries.

The bush has 6 clusters, each containing 20 raspberries. To find the total number of raspberries in the clusters, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of raspberries per cluster: 6 * 20 = 120.

Next, we add the number of individual raspberries to the total number of raspberries in the clusters: 120 + 67 = 187.

Therefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 187.

The final answer is: 187"
"To determine the number of good oranges, we first need to calculate the number of unripe oranges. Given that 20% of the oranges are unripe, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 25 = (20/100) * 25 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Next, we know that there is 1 bad orange. Therefore, the total number of oranges that are not good is the sum of the unripe and bad oranges:

1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges:

25 (total) - 6 (not good) = 19 oranges are good.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to consider the costs associated with the material, the jeweler, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500, and the cost of the jeweler's services is $800. Therefore, the total cost before insurance is $500 + $800 = $1300.

To calculate the insurance cost, we need to find 10% of the total cost before insurance. This can be done by multiplying $1300 by 0.1, which yields $130.

Finally, to obtain the total amount paid, we add the cost before insurance and the insurance cost: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

The final answer is: $1430"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider the pension structure. For the first 20 years, she receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000. After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

The value of the pension after 20 years is the fixed annual pension multiplied by the number of years, which is $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she receives 5% of the value of the pension, which is 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000/year.

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be the sum of the fixed pension for the first 20 years and the 5% pension for the remaining 10 years, which is $50,000/year + $50,000/year = $100,000/year.

The final answer is: $100,000."
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The streaming service charges Aleena $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months and the second half of the year also consists of 6 months.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount, which is 90% of the initial amount. This can be calculated as 0.9 * $140 = $126.

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To determine the distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. This can be achieved by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up by the amount of gas used.

Given that Sophia has traveled 100 miles since the last fill-up and used 4 gallons of gas, we can calculate the mpg rating as follows:

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we have the car's mpg rating, we can find the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity by the mpg rating. The owner's manual states that the tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

total miles = tank capacity * mpg
total miles = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total miles = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the total time spent on TV and reading, we first need to calculate the daily time spent on these activities. 

Given that Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long, which is 1 hour, the total daily time spent on TV and reading is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since this pattern is repeated 7 days a week, the total weekly time spent on TV and reading is 3 hours * 7 days = 21 hours.

To find the total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 21 hours * 4 = 84 hours.

The final answer is: 84"

Each school has two teams: a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team, each consisting of 5 players. Therefore, the total number of students per school is 2 * 5 = 10.

In addition to the students, each school also has two coaches, one for each team.

Consequently, the total number of individuals per school is 10 (students) + 2 (coaches) = 12.

Since there are four schools participating in the tournament, the total number of individuals sent by all the schools is 4 * 12 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we first need to establish the quantities of each type of gem. 

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds, which is 175. Therefore, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

Next, we calculate the number of emeralds, which is twice the number of rubies. This yields 2 * 140 = 280 emeralds.

To find the total number of gems, we sum the quantities of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

"To determine the monthly payment for Shiela's cell phone installment plan, we first need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones, including the interest charged.

The original price of the cell phones is $150 per unit, and Shiela purchased 5 units. Therefore, the total original price is 5 * $150 = $750.

A 2% interest will be charged on the original price of each unit. To calculate the interest, we multiply the original price by the interest rate: 0.02 * $150 = $3.

Since the interest is charged on each unit, we multiply the interest by the number of units: $3 * 5 = $15.

The total cost of the cell phones, including the interest, is the sum of the original price and the interest: $750 + $15 = $765.

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total cost by the number of installments: $765 / 3 = $255.

"To find the average square footage of a level in the sandcastle, we need to calculate the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, we can determine the square footage of the subsequent levels by halving the square footage of the level above it. Therefore, the second level has a square footage of 16 / 2 = 8, the third level has a square footage of 8 / 2 = 4, and the fourth level has a square footage of 4 / 2 = 2.

Now, let's calculate the total square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

Since there are 4 levels in total, we can find the average square footage by dividing the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

"To determine the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year. 

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. This can be calculated as 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

For the rest of the year, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the number of days remaining in the year after the first 180 days is 365 - 180 = 185 days. Therefore, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is the sum of the amount eaten in the first 180 days and the amount eaten in the rest of the year, which is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To determine the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we first need to establish the relative quantities of laundry each individual performs.

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can calculate David's laundry as follows:

David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
= 400 / 4
= 100 pounds

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
= 400 / 2
= 200 pounds

Now, we can calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry

"To determine the better price for purchasing flowers, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

"To determine the cost of the grooming after the discount, we first need to calculate the discount amount. This can be done by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage.

The original price of the grooming is $100, and the discount percentage is 30%. To find the discount amount, we multiply 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%) by $100.

Discount amount = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the cost after the discount.

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

Therefore, the cost of the grooming after the discount is $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To determine the amount of water left, we first need to calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls. Since each girl received 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate this as follows:

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Given that there are two girls, the total amount of water they received is 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Next, we need to account for the water taken by the boy, which is 6 liters.

The total amount of water taken by both the girls and the boy is 8 + 6 = 14 liters.

"To solve this problem, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W.

We know that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which can be expressed as W = L + 8. Additionally, we are given that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is W + L = 22.

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22

Combining like terms, we get 2L + 8 = 22. Subtracting 8 from both sides yields 2L = 14. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us L = 7.

Now that we have found the value of L, we can determine the number of games the team won by substituting L into the first equation: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"

"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and sum these values.

The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we must first calculate the salary increase for the initial five years of service. Given that the company increases the salaries of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year, we can express this as a geometric series.

Let's denote the initial salary as S0 = $600 and the annual increase as r = 1.1 (representing a 10% increase). The salary after n years can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence: Sn = S0 * r^n.

For the first five years, the salary is S5 = $600 * (1.1)^5.

S5 = $600 * 1.1^5
S5 = $600 * 1.61051
S5 â‰ˆ $966.306

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next three years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after five years.

The salary after six years is S6 = S5 * 1.1
S6 = $966.306 * 1.1
S6 â‰ˆ $1062.9366

The salary after seven years is S7 = S6 * 1.1
S7 = $1062.9366 * 1.1
S7 â‰ˆ $1167.23326

The salary after eight years is S8 = S7 * 1.1
S8 = $1167.23326 * 1.1
S8 â‰ˆ $1281.155886

The salary after nine years is S9 = S8 * 1.1
S9 = $1281.155886 * 1.1
S9 â‰ˆ $1403.1703666

The final answer is: $1403.17"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of copies sold by Marilyn and Harald. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combining like terms, we get:

11H = 88,000

To find the value of H, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8000}$"
"To determine the total cost of gift bags for Christina's party, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests do not show up, we can find the number of attending guests by subtracting 1/4 of the total number of guests from the total number of guests.

Let's denote the total number of guests as G. Then, the number of guests who do not show up is (1/4)G. The number of guests who will attend is G - (1/4)G = (3/4)G.

Given that Christina invited 16 friends, we can substitute G = 16 into the equation to find the number of attending guests:

(3/4) * 16 = 12

Now, we know that Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest. To find the total number of gift bags needed, we multiply the number of attending guests by 0.75:

12 * 0.75 = 9

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of gift bags by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag, which is $2:

9 * $2 = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad required for the dinosaur picnic, we must first calculate the amount consumed by adults and children separately.

Adult dinosaurs will eat 10 pounds of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults attending the picnic. Therefore, the total amount of potato salad consumed by adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Children, on the other hand, will eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad each. Since there are 5 children attending the picnic, the total amount of potato salad consumed by children is 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts consumed by adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

Therefore, Ted the T-Rex needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure that everyone has enough to eat.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the total number of pets the three individuals have, we can establish a logical sequence of events based on the given information.

First, we know that Cindy has four pets. 

Given that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, we can calculate Marcia's total by adding two to Cindy's total: 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Next, we are informed that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. To find Jan's total, we multiply Marcia's total by three: 6 * 3 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To determine the age of Jackson, we can establish a series of relationships between the children's ages.

Let's denote the age of Corey as C, Amy as A, Jackson as J, and James as M. We are given the following information:

1. M = 10 (James is 10 years old)
2. M = C - 1 (James is 1 year younger than Corey)
3. C = 11 (from equation 2, since M = 10)
4. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
5. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)

Substituting the value of C from equation 3 into equation 4, we get A = 11 - 2 = 9. Then, substituting the value of A into equation 5, we get 9 = J + 5. Solving for J, we get J = 9 - 5 = 4.

Therefore, the age of Jackson is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine Gerald's new time, we first need to establish his original time. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can express Gerald's original time as Lee's time plus 2 seconds. Given that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Next, we need to account for the 10% improvement in Gerald's speed due to his new diet. This improvement can be calculated as 10% of his original time, which is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.

To find Gerald's new time, we subtract the improvement from his original time: 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

Therefore, Gerald's new time is 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we first establish the relationship between the number of dogs and cats. Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as 2 * 60 = 120.

Next, we calculate the combined number of dogs and cats, which is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

The final answer is: 348"
"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to calculate the total number of girls in the class. Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining fraction represents the girls.

Let's calculate the number of boys: 2/5 * 200 = 80

Now, we can find the number of girls: 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. It is given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls: 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we first need to calculate the number of hours James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of the hours Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can find James' hours by multiplying 9 by 2/3.

James' hours = (2/3) * 9
James' hours = 6

Now, we can find the difference in hours slept between Harry and James by subtracting James' hours from Harry's hours.

Difference = Harry's hours - James' hours
Difference = 9 - 6
Difference = 3

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine the number of tomatoes used by Freda, we first need to calculate the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be twice the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Given that each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can calculate the number of cans used by dividing the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can then determine the total number of tomatoes used by multiplying the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used by Freda is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Since 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

We know that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, and there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, with 5 taking an exit. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Setting up the equation x + 20 = 25, we can solve for x by subtracting 20 from both sides:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we first need to calculate the total number of potted plants she possesses. Initially, she has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home, resulting in a total of 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

Subsequently, she received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, bringing her total to 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

However, she has decided to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, which amounts to a total of 40 potted plants being given away.

To find the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the individual contributions of each friend and then sum them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. 

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This can be calculated as 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's calculate the total number of doorbell rings by summing up the individual contributions of each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he has to read. This can be done by summing the pages from each of his textbooks.

The total number of pages is given by the sum of the pages from the Science, Social Studies, History, and Geography textbooks: 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract this from the total to find the remaining number of pages.

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Now, we need to find the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day. This can be calculated by dividing the remaining number of pages by the number of days he has to complete his reading, which is 4.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average per day to complete his reading within the given timeframe.

"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he consumes on weekdays and weekends separately, and then sum these values.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, the total number of glasses of water consumed on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and one before bed) and 1 glass of soda with dinner. Therefore, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, the total number of glasses of water consumed on weekends is 3 * 2 = 6.

The total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is the sum of the glasses consumed on weekdays and weekends, which is 20 + 6 = 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total time required to cover the city's width. Given that the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes, we can establish a rate of 3 miles per 10 minutes.

The city spans 42 miles from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge. To find the total time required, we can divide the total distance by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

First, we calculate the number of 3-mile sections within the city's width by dividing the total distance by the section length:

42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile section, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section:

14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

The final answer is: 140"
"To determine the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed, we first calculate the number of pieces placed by Poppy, which is a quarter of the total 1000 pieces. This can be computed as 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Subsequently, we need to find the number of pieces remaining after Poppy's placement. This is given by 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces.

Next, we calculate the number of pieces placed by Poppy's mom, which is a third of the remaining 750 pieces. This can be computed as 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Finally, we determine the number of pieces left to be placed by subtracting the number of pieces placed by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces. This is given by 750 - 250 = 500 pieces.

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is 500.

Given that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can calculate Cody's cookie consumption by multiplying Amir's cookie intake by 3.

Cody's cookies = 3 * 5 = 15

Now, to find the total number of cookies consumed by both individuals, we simply add the number of cookies each person eats.

Total cookies = Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies
Total cookies = 5 + 15
Total cookies = 20

Therefore, the total number of cookies consumed by both Cody and Amir is 20.

"To determine the total inner volume of the three boxes, we must first calculate the inner dimensions of each box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 1 inch from each dimension to obtain the inner dimensions.

The length of the box is 5 inches, so the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches.

The width of the box is 6 inches, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of the box is 4 inches, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are three boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to obtain the total inner volume: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

Therefore, the total inner volume of the three boxes is 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time spent watching TV and subtract the time spent watching other episodes.

Let's break down the time spent watching 1-hour episodes: 
- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 * 1 = 2 hours of 1-hour episodes.
- On Thursday, he watched 1 hour of a 1-hour episode.
- On Friday, he watched 2 * 1 = 2 hours of 1-hour episodes.

Total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent watching TV: 7 hours.

The time spent watching 30-minute episodes is the difference between the total time spent watching TV and the time spent watching 1-hour episodes: 7 - 5 = 2 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is 2 / 0.5 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of cookies Henry baked last year and the number he baked this year. Let's denote the number of cookies he baked last year as x.

Given that Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, the number of cookies he intended to bake this year is 2x. However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, resulting in a total of 2x + 15 cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, Henry has a total of 110 cookies. This can be represented by the equation 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110. Subtracting 10 from both sides yields 2x = 100. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 50.

Therefore, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is 50.

"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each consumed. This can be achieved by multiplying the width of each roll-up by its respective length.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

Subsequently, we calculate the average number of roll-ups eaten by adding the total number of roll-ups consumed by each and dividing by 2.

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

"To determine the amount of water the boat took on, we need to calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. It took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, which means the boat is taking on water at a rate of 2 liters per 10 feet. To find the rate per second, we can divide the distance by the time: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

Now, let's find the total distance rowed in 64 seconds: 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet. Since the boat takes on water at a rate of 2 liters per 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10 to find the number of sets: 80 feet / 10 = 8 sets.

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2 to find the total amount of water taken on: 8 sets * 2 liters/set = 16 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"To solve this problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of photographs that Jamal's and Brittany's phones can hold, and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D. According to the problem, the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Therefore, the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50D.

We are also given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the following equation:

6(50D) = 1800

Simplifying the equation, we get:

300D = 1800

Dividing both sides by 300, we get:

D = 6

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

"To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we first need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she has. She has 10 boards that are 2 x 4 x 10, which cost $10 each, and 5 boards that are 4 x 4 x 10, which cost $16 each.

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100. The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is the sum of these two amounts, which is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have increased by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. Therefore, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each, and the new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total revenue is the sum of these two amounts, which is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.

Given that the total amount of the mixture is 120, we can set up a proportion to find the number of parts that represent the sugar. Let's denote the number of parts of sugar as 'x'. Since the ratio of sugar to the total mixture is 7:20, we can set up the following proportion:

7/20 = x/120

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 20x
840 = 20x

Now, we can divide both sides by 20 to isolate 'x':

x = 840 / 20
x = 42

Therefore, the number of parts that represent the sugar is 42. Since the ratio is in terms of teaspoons, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is also 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To determine the total amount John paid for the shoes, we first calculate the cost of the shoes for one child. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child and each pair costs $60, the total cost for one child is 2 * $60 = $120.

"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the initial salaries of Adrien and Lylah. Let's denote Adrien's initial salary as A and Lylah's initial salary as L. We are given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, which can be expressed as A = 1.3L.

We are also given that Adrien's initial salary was $40000. Substituting this value into the equation A = 1.3L, we can solve for L:

1.3L = 40000
L = 40000 / 1.3
L = 30769.23

Now that we have the initial salaries, we can calculate their salaries four years later. We are given that both salaries increased by 40% of their initial values. Adrien's new salary is A + 0.4A = 1.4A, and Lylah's new salary is L + 0.4L = 1.4L.

Substituting the initial values, we get:

Adrien's new salary: 1.4 * 40000 = 56000
Lylah's new salary: 1.4 * 30769.23 = 43117.12

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries:

Total salary = 56000 + 43117.12 = 99117.12

The final answer is: $99117.12"
"To determine the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we first need to calculate the weekly usage and then extrapolate it to a monthly basis.

Given that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week, and each pad contains 30 sheets, his weekly usage can be calculated as follows:

Weekly usage = 2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the monthly usage by multiplying the weekly usage by 4:

Monthly usage = 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"To determine the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael have, we first need to calculate the number of fruits each individual brought.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

The total number of fruits Morisette brought is 5 + 8 = 13.
The total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

Therefore, the total number of fruits they have in total is 13 + 14 = 27.

"To determine the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and sum them up.

Let's break down the hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 6 hours each, as she slept 2 hours less than Monday.
- Thursday to Sunday: 7 hours each, as she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48

"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs at two different speeds: 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours and 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. This can be found using the formula Distance = Speed x Time. Substituting the given values, we get:

Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Next, we need to find the remaining time after 3 hours. The total time Rosie has to run is 7 hours, so the remaining time is:

Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour:

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we can use the information provided. Jennie stamps one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps, which is equivalent to 20 letters. This leaves 40 letters in the pile of letters needing stamps.

Let's denote the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as x. After Jennie stamps 20 letters, the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile is x + 20. We are given that this total is equal to 30.

We can set up the equation x + 20 = 30 to represent this relationship. Solving for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 30 - 20
x = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of spoons in the package Julia bought, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 'x' spoons. Her husband then gave her 5 more spoons, bringing the total to 'x + 5'. After using 3 spoons, Julia had 'x + 5 - 3' spoons left. We are told that this final amount is equal to 12.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Thus, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan purchased, we must first identify the quantities of each type of sausage. It is given that Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. Additionally, he acquired 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. Therefore, the number of fish sausages can be calculated as 38 + 6 = 44.

To find the total number of sausages, we sum the quantities of chicken and fish sausages: 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to calculate the number of friends each of them has and then sum these values.

Given that Lily made 50 friends, and Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, we can calculate Amy's number of friends as follows: 50 (Lily's friends) + 20 = 70 (Amy's friends).

Now, we can find the total number of friends by adding the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the total amount of money Dillon will spend at the store, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them together.

First, we establish the cost of each item. The cost of a pepper is given as $15. 

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange, which is 5 dollars less than a watermelon. Therefore, the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we calculate the total cost of each item. Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180.

Dillon also buys 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers is 20 * $15 = $300.

Lastly, Dillon purchases 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we sum the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we first need to calculate the total time spent by doctors. This can be done by multiplying the number of patients by the average time per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Next, we calculate the total revenue for the hospital by multiplying the number of patients by the hourly rate charged to the patients, and then converting the result to hours.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour = 2000 * $200/hour = $400000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $400000 - $30000
Profit = $370000

The final answer is: $370000"
"To determine the number of elves left, we first need to calculate the number of elves that quit after being subjected to unpleasant situations. A third of the initial 60 elves quit, which can be calculated as 60 / 3 = 20. This leaves us with 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

However, 10 more elves quit after being kicked by children, resulting in a further reduction of 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30."
"To determine the total expenditure for the two months, we need to calculate the expenditure in June first. Since the expenditure in June is $60 less than in May, we can find it by subtracting $60 from the expenditure in May.

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = Expenditure in May - $60
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60
Expenditure in June = $440

Now, we can find the total expenditure by adding the expenditures in May and June.

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

The final answer is: $940"
"To determine the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred at the carnival, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, resulting in a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Similarly, Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, resulting in a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is the sum of Pam's rides and Fred's rides, which is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the total miles he walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles walked on Tuesday as 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We can use this information to find the miles walked on Wednesday by subtracting the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total. Therefore, the miles walked on Wednesday can be calculated as 41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the annual expenditure on car washes, we first need to calculate the monthly expenditure. Given that Tom receives 4 car washes per month and each car wash costs $15, the monthly expenditure can be calculated as follows:

Monthly expenditure = Number of car washes per month * Cost per car wash
= 4 * $15
= $60

Since there are 12 months in a year, the annual expenditure can be calculated by multiplying the monthly expenditure by 12:

Annual expenditure = Monthly expenditure * 12
= $60 * 12
= $720

Therefore, Tom's annual expenditure on car washes is $720."
"To determine the number of video games Bobby has, we first need to calculate the number of video games Brian has after losing 5. Initially, Brian has 20 video games, but he lost 5, resulting in 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Now, we need to find 3 times the number of video games Brian has. This is calculated as 3 * 15 = 45.

Bobby has 5 fewer video games than 3 times the number of video games Brian has. Therefore, we subtract 5 from 45 to find the number of video games Bobby has: 45 - 5 = 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to calculate the number of unicorns residing in the Scottish Highlands. Given that one third of the total 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = 27 / 3 = 9

Next, we need to find the number of female unicorns within this subset. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = 2/3 * 9 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we must first calculate the cost of the items, then add the delivery fee, and finally, include the tip.

The cost of the items can be calculated as follows:

- The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00.
- The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00.
- The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00.
- The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items. This can be calculated as 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00. Therefore, the total cost with the delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Finally, we add the tip of $5.00 to the total cost with the delivery fee, resulting in a total cost of $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test. Given that he completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour and had 8 hours to complete it, we can find the number of questions completed as follows:

Number of questions completed in the first test = 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

Next, we'll calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test. Given that he completed the test at the same rate of 5 questions per hour and had 6 hours to complete it, we can find the number of questions completed as follows:

Number of questions completed in the second test = 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Now, we can find the total number of questions completed by adding the number of questions completed in both tests:

Total questions completed = 40 questions + 30 questions = 70 questions

The total number of questions in both tests is the sum of the questions in each test:

Total questions in both tests = 75 questions + 100 questions = 175 questions

Finally, we can find the number of questions left incomplete by subtracting the total number of questions completed from the total number of questions in both tests:

Questions left incomplete = 175 questions - 70 questions = 105 questions

The final answer is: 105"
"To determine the number of pink gumballs in the candy machine, we first need to calculate four times the number of blue gumballs. Given that there are 12 blue gumballs, this can be calculated as 4 * 12 = 48.

Next, we are informed that there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs. Therefore, the number of pink gumballs can be found by adding 22 to the result of the previous calculation, yielding 48 + 22 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the available rentals, we first need to calculate the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Given that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the sum of automatic and manual cars from the total.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationships between the number of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q.

Given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, we can express this relationship as W = 2B. Additionally, we know that there are twice as many babies as queens, which can be represented as B = 2Q.

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write the equation W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we find that Q = 100.

Now that we have the value of Q, we can find the value of B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q, which gives us B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the value of W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B, which gives us W = 2(200) = 400.

Therefore, the number of worker bees in the hive is 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Given that Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he were to dedicate this time to working, he would effectively work 2 hours more each day. 

There are 7 days in a standard week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

Jordan's hourly wage is $10. Therefore, the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine the total cost of the items purchased, we must first categorize the items into food and non-food items. The food items are milk and eggs, which cost 2 dollars and 3 dollars, respectively. The total cost of the food items is therefore 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, which cost 3 dollars, 3 dollars, and 4 dollars, respectively. The total cost of the non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we must calculate the tax amount. This is done by multiplying the cost of the non-food items by 0.1, which yields 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the non-food items to obtain the total cost of the non-food items with tax: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items with tax to obtain the total cost: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Kim's weekly profit, we must first calculate his total expenses. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. With a total of 8 clients, the total number of bottles of bleach needed per week is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed per week is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of bleach per week is 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32, and the cost of cloths per week is 8 packs * $5/pack = $40. Therefore, the total expenses per week are $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Given that Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we first need to calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest. Given that there are 100 pineapples per hectare and John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year to find the total number of pineapples harvested within a year:

1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To determine the total number of LEGO pieces Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and sum them together.

The first set contains 500 pieces. The second set has three times more pieces than the first set, which is 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The third set has one-fourth the number of pieces of the first set, which is 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

Now, we add the number of pieces in each set together: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The total number of LEGO pieces Johnny picks up is 2125."
"To determine the number of bees that Debra sees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, we can break down the events step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. In the subsequent 6 hours, half of these bees return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees. At this point, the total number of bees that have left the hive is 30, and 15 have returned, leaving 15 bees that have not yet returned.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. This results in 2 * 30 = 60 bees departing the hive. Consequently, the total number of bees that have left the hive is now 30 (initially left) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees. However, 15 of these bees had not returned yet, and 15 bees that left in the first 6 hours had not yet returned. Therefore, the number of bees that have not returned yet is 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. This means that the 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours and had not yet returned will return to the hive. Therefore, the number of bees that Debra sees return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of admission for an adult is $12 and for a child is $10. Given that Brittany's mom purchased one of each, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can infer that the amount she gave the cashier is the sum of the total cost and the change received.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To determine the number of Facebook friends James has, we can establish a relationship between the number of friends each person has. Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as ""D"". 

Given that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express this as an equation: C = 3D, where C represents the number of friends Charlie has. We are also given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can substitute this value into the equation: 12 = 3D.

To find the value of D, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
D = 12 / 3
D = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine the number of friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express this as an equation: J = 4D, where J represents the number of friends James has. Substituting the value of D into this equation, we get:
J = 4 * 4
J = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the outcome of the race between Steve and Tim, we must first calculate the time it takes for each of them to return home from school.

Steve's distance from school is 3 miles, which is equivalent to 5280 feet. His speed on the bike is 440 feet per minute. 

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 5280 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 12 minutes

On the other hand, Tim's distance from school is 2 miles, which is equivalent to 10560 feet. His speed on the skateboard is 264 feet per minute.

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Given that Steve takes 12 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, it is evident that Steve is the winner of the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 12
Difference in time = 28 minutes

"To determine the total revenue generated by Shawnda's bike inflation service, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's consider the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has two tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. Therefore, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, we'll consider the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has three tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. Thus, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9.

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Lastly, we'll consider the unicycle tire. A unicycle has one tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. Therefore, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue by adding up the cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

"To determine the amount of change Carl receives after purchasing ten packs of cookies, we must first calculate the total cost of the cookies. Each pack contains six cookies, and each cookie costs $0.10.

Given:
- Number of packs: 10
- Cookies per pack: 6
- Cost per cookie: $0.10

The total number of cookies can be calculated by multiplying the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

The total cost of the cookies is then found by multiplying the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is the difference between the $10 bill and the total cost of the cookies: $10 - $6 = $4.

Therefore, the change Carl receives is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the initial number of french fries as x. 

Dave initially ate 14 french fries. The seagull then ate half of this amount, which is 7 french fries. The total number of fries eaten at this point is 14 + 7 = 21.

Next, three pigeons ate 3 fries each, resulting in a total of 9 additional fries eaten. This brings the total number of fries eaten to 21 + 9 = 30.

Let's consider the remaining fries after the pigeons ate. The raccoon then ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. We can express the number of fries remaining after the raccoon ate as (1/3)(x - 30), where x is the initial number of fries.

After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. This can be expressed as the equation (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can first add 1 to both sides of the equation, resulting in (1/3)(x - 30) = 6. Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us x - 30 = 18. Finally, adding 30 to both sides yields x = 48.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

Kimo has three 1-hour classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. This results in a total of 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week for these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes, which amounts to 4 hours per day. With two days, this totals to 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

Combining these, we find that Kimo attends classes for 9 + 8 = 17 hours per week.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we must first convert the length of each item to a common unit. Since the question asks for the total length in feet, it is most convenient to express the length of the baguettes in inches, as the rolls and croissants are already given in inches.

Each baguette is two feet long, which is equivalent to 2 * 12 = 24 inches. Now, we can calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Next, we sum the total length of each type of baked good:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet by dividing by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

"To determine the total number of bananas required for a 2-month period, we must first calculate the monthly consumption of each primate species and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, while the gorillas need 400 bananas per month. The baboons, on the other hand, consume 100 bananas per month.

To find the total monthly consumption, we add the bananas needed for each species: 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since we are interested in a 2-month period, we multiply the total monthly consumption by 2: 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper must order 1400 bananas to meet the needs of the primates for a 2-month period."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran. Blake's distance can be calculated by multiplying the number of times he ran back and forth by twice the length of the football field, as he covers the entire length of the field for each run. This gives us 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly's distance can be broken down into two components: her initial run back and forth, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards, and her subsequent runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She performs this latter action 34 times, resulting in a total distance of 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Comparing the distances, it is evident that Blake's distance of 3000 yards exceeds Kelly's distance of 2920 yards, making him the winner.

To find the difference in distance between the winner and the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total amount spent by Raphael, we must calculate the individual costs of the items he purchased and then sum them.

The cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6, as each pen costs $1.5 and he bought 4 of them.

The cost of the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $8, as each notebook costs $4 and he bought 2 of them.

The cost of the bond paper is $20, as stated in the problem.

Now, we add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on the school supplies."
"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond, we need to consider the changes in the tadpole population. Initially, Finn observes 11 tadpoles. Subsequently, 6 tadpoles emerge from under a lily pad, increasing the total number of tadpoles he can see to 11 + 6 = 17. However, 2 of these tadpoles then hide under a rock, rendering them invisible to Finn. To find the updated number of tadpoles Finn can see, we subtract the 2 that hid: 17 - 2 = 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we first need to calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday. Given that the tank had 7 feet more water on Tuesday than it did on Monday, and the initial depth on Monday was 17 feet, the depth on Tuesday can be calculated as follows:

Depth on Tuesday = Depth on Monday + 7 feet
Depth on Tuesday = 17 feet + 7 feet
Depth on Tuesday = 24 feet

Next, we need to find two thirds of the depth on Tuesday to determine the depth on Wednesday. This can be calculated using the following equation:

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * Depth on Tuesday
Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24 feet
Depth on Wednesday = (2 * 24) / 3
Depth on Wednesday = 48 / 3
Depth on Wednesday = 16 feet

Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we first need to calculate the number of fish caught by each individual. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. The total number of fish caught by Anakin can be calculated as follows:

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19

Now, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. He also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Additionally, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13

To find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin, we add the total number of fish caught by each individual:

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we can model the price increase as an exponential function. The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20, and the price increases by 20% every two months.

Let's denote the initial price as P0 = $20 and the number of months as n. The price increase can be calculated as Pn = P0 * (1 + 0.20)^(n/2), where n is the number of months.

To find the price after 36 months, we can plug in n = 36 into the equation:

P36 = 20 * (1 + 0.20)^(36/2)
= 20 * (1.20)^18
= 20 * 5.0592
â‰ˆ 101.184

However, this is an approximation. To get a more accurate result, we can use a calculator or a computer program to calculate the value of (1.20)^18.

Using a calculator, we get:
(1.20)^18 â‰ˆ 5.0592

Now, we can multiply this value by the initial price:
P36 â‰ˆ 20 * 5.0592
â‰ˆ 101.184

Rounding to two decimal places, the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $101.18.

The final answer is: $101.18"
"To determine the total worth of the toys in the room, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them together.

First, we establish the cost of an action figure as $5. Given that one red car costs $4, we can proceed to calculate the cost of the other toys.

The doll's cost is equivalent to that of 3 action figures, which is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of toy:
- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

The total worth of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the financial implications of Jackie's decision, we need to consider the opportunity cost of doing her taxes herself. By choosing to do her taxes, she will forego 3 hours of freelance work, resulting in a loss of income. The hourly wage for her freelance work is $35. Therefore, the income she will lose is:

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

On the other hand, hiring an accountant will incur a direct cost of $90. To find the difference in her financial outcome, we need to compare the income lost to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories and subtract this from her budget.

The cost of the computer is â‚¬1090, the scanner is â‚¬157, the CD burner is â‚¬74, and the printer is â‚¬102. 

The total cost of the computer accessories is the sum of these individual costs: 
â‚¬1090 + â‚¬157 = â‚¬1247
â‚¬1247 + â‚¬74 = â‚¬1321
â‚¬1321 + â‚¬102 = â‚¬1423

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget of â‚¬1500:
â‚¬1500 - â‚¬1423 = â‚¬77

Elvira will have â‚¬77 left for her clothing.

The final answer is: â‚¬77"
"To determine the number of times Sandra must babysit to obtain the necessary eggs for her school fundraiser, we first calculate the total number of eggs required. Given that each Spanish flan necessitates 3 eggs and she is tasked with making 15, the total number of eggs needed is 3 * 15 = 45.

Next, we divide the total number of eggs required by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job, which is 9. Therefore, the number of times Sandra must babysit is 45 / 9 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables. Let B represent Brooke's current age and S represent Seth's current age. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which can be expressed as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be represented as (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28. Combining like terms, we have 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation yields 3B = 24. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can determine Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B. This gives us S = 2(8) = 16.

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jimmy has, we first need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel possesses. Given that Ethel has $8, we can calculate this as 2 * 8 = 16.

Next, we are informed that Jimmy has $2 more than this calculated amount. Therefore, we add 2 to 16, resulting in 16 + 2 = 18.

Thus, Jimmy has $18."
"To determine the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking habits. He walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which encompasses 5 days. On the weekends, he walks 10 miles a day, covering Saturday and Sunday.

First, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Friday: 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.

Next, we calculate the total miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we sum the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend: 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we must first calculate the individual costs of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The cost of the hat is a given, $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, which is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each uniform by adding the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150"

First, we calculate the number of legs for the spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs.

Next, we calculate the number of legs for the insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs.

Lastly, we calculate the number of legs for the rare mutant invertebrates: 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs.

To find the total number of legs, we sum the legs from each group: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1210}$"
"To determine the total age of the four birds, we can establish a series of relationships between their ages.

Let's denote the age of Sally Two as x. Since Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, we can express Granny Red's age as 2 * 8 = 16.

However, we are also given that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Therefore, we can express Sally Two's age as 16 + 3 = 19.

Now, we can verify that Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo are indeed 8 years old, as stated in the problem.

To find the total age of the four birds, we can add their ages together: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

The final answer is: 51"
"To determine the total annual payment, we must first calculate the increased minimum payment for each debt. This is achieved by multiplying the minimum payment by 1.5.

For the student loans, the increased minimum payment is $300 * 1.5 = $450. For the credit card, it is $200 * 1.5 = $300. Lastly, the mortgage's increased minimum payment is $500 * 1.5 = $750.

Now, we sum the increased minimum payments to obtain the total monthly payment: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500.

To find the total annual payment, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To determine the total time required for Billy to prepare the potatoes, we must first calculate the time it takes to peel and cut a single potato, then multiply these values by the total number of potatoes.

The time to peel a potato is given as 1.5 minutes. To cut a potato, it takes 5 seconds, which is equivalent to 5/60 minutes. 

Now, we can calculate the total time to peel all 60 potatoes: 60 * 1.5 minutes = 90 minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time to cut all 60 potatoes: 60 * (5/60) minutes = 5 minutes.

Finally, we add the time to peel and cut all potatoes to obtain the total time: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes.

Therefore, the total time required for Billy to prepare the potatoes is 95 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{95}$"
"To determine the amount spent on lemons, we need to first calculate the total revenue generated from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's begin by calculating the total revenue per gallon. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, the total revenue per gallon is:

20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

Given that they made a profit of $25, we can express their total revenue as:

Total revenue = Profit + Cost
Total revenue = $25 + Cost

Since they sell each gallon for $10, the number of gallons they sold is:

Number of gallons = Total revenue / $10

We can now solve for the number of gallons:

Number of gallons = ($25 + Cost) / $10

However, we need to express the cost in terms of the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5, and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. Therefore, the cost of lemons per gallon is:

Cost of lemons per gallon = $5 - $2 = $3

The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:

Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 * (($25 + Cost) / $10)

Since we are given that the total profit is $25, we can set up the equation:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$10 * Number of gallons - ($3 * Number of gallons) - ($2 * Number of gallons) = $25

Simplifying the equation:

$10 * (($25 + x) / $10) - $5 * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25

(10 - 5) * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
5 * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
(25 + x) / 2 = $25
25 + x = $50
x = $25

Now that we have the total cost, we can find the cost of lemons:

Total cost = $25
Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
Total cost of lemons = $25

The final answer is: $25"
"To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to calculate the total number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 participants in total and 80 of them are Japanese, we can find the number of Chinese participants by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total.

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

"To determine the amount of money Zaid has left after his expenses and donations, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on rent: 1/4 of 6000 is 600. 

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: 1/3 of 6000 is 2000.

Now, we subtract these expenses from Zaid's monthly income to find the remaining amount: 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400.

Zaid then donates half of this remaining amount to his favorite charity: 1/2 of 3400 is 1700.

After the donation, the remaining amount is 3400 - 1700 = 1700.

Zaid also allocates funds for his daughter and wife, totaling 200 + 700 = 900.

Finally, we subtract this total from the remaining amount to find the final amount Zaid has left: 1700 - 900 = 800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the total number of crabs the three individuals possess, we must first establish the number of crabs each person has. 

Given that Bo has 40 crabs, we can deduce that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, Monic's total is 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Next, we know that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. Consequently, Rani's total is 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs, we sum the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

The final answer is: 122"

80 - 60 = 20

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the number of red roses that Fred must deliver to Sandra, we need to establish the relationship between the number of white carnations and the number of red roses. We are given that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x, and we know that 5x = 200. 

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We are given that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40. 
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables for the ages of Jan and Mark. Let's denote Jan's current age as J and Mark's current age as M.

From the given information, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can express this as:
J = M + 2

We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 28. Therefore, we can write the equation:
M - 2 = (1/2) * 28 + 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:
M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we have Mark's current age, we can find Jan's age using the first equation:
J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

However, we are asked to find Jean's age. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can express Jean's age as:
Jean's age = M + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the time difference between the two teams, we need to calculate the total time for each team. 

The well-rounded team's total time is the product of the time taken by each runner, which is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's runners' times can be calculated as follows: the first runner runs 60 seconds, the second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To determine the likelihood of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, we first need to calculate the probability of this event. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the die is rolled independently, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. As the events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of the latter from the former: 50% - 25% = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we first need to establish the number of apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, and her mother picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's contribution by dividing her mother's total by 2.

Jenna's apples = 20 / 2 = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother, we simply add the number of apples each of them picked.

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mother's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we must first calculate the total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters and the rabbits. The hamsters are kept in 10 cages, with each hamster receiving 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. Thus, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, with each rat receiving 6 pieces of straw. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. The total number of rats in 3 cages is then 3r.

The total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount Mandy should pay, we can utilize the formula for compound interest, which is A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount (initial amount owed), r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of months.

Given that the principal amount P is $100, the monthly interest rate r is 2% or 0.02, and the number of months n is 3, we can calculate the total amount A as follows:

A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3
A = 100(1.02)^3
A = 100 * 1.061208
A = 106.1208

Therefore, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'.

The total cost of purchasing the bags is $20x, and the total cost of transporting each bag is $2x. Therefore, the total cost is $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x, as each bag is sold at $30.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is given as $400. This can be represented by the equation:

$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we find:

x = $400 / $8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total cost incurred by the three friends, we must first calculate the individual components of their expenses. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, which is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is $33 per ride, and they went on 2 rides, resulting in a total cost of 2 * $33 = $66.

To find the total cost, we sum the individual components: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since the friends agreed to split the total cost evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

Therefore, each friend paid $34.

The final answer is $34."
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the peaches collected per minute and the total minutes spent collecting.

John collects 2 peaches per minute. 
He collects for 3 hours. 
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes spent collecting is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of peaches per minute by the total minutes:
2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

Therefore, the total number of peaches John collects is 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the daily insect consumption of a flock of ten ducks, we first need to calculate the total weekly insect consumption. Given that each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week, the total weekly consumption for the flock can be calculated as follows:

Total weekly consumption = 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can then calculate the daily consumption by dividing the total weekly consumption by 7:

Daily consumption = 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks requires 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to consider the net change in the number of trees over this period. 

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, resulting in a net increase of 8 trees per year. Over 10 years, this net increase amounts to 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees. Therefore, after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39.

Consequently, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To determine the difference between the number of pink and white plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard at noon on Sunday, we need to break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos. On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. These 6 flamingos were then painted white and returned to the yard. Consequently, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. Therefore, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the amount of change Violetta will receive after purchasing the crayons, we first need to calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since she requires 5 different colors and each crayon costs $2, she will need to buy 2 crayons of each color.

Number of crayons per color = 2
Number of colors = 5
Total number of crayons = Number of crayons per color * Number of colors
Total number of crayons = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons = 10

The total cost of the crayons can be calculated by multiplying the total number of crayons by the cost of one crayon.

Cost of one crayon = $2
Total cost of crayons = Total number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 * $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

Since Violetta has $20 and the total cost of the crayons is also $20, we can calculate the change she will receive.

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

The final answer is: $0"
"To determine the cost of a pen, we must first establish the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser, as the problem states that a pen costs as much as this combination. 

Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the combined cost as follows:
Combined cost = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Since a pen costs the same as this combined cost, we can now calculate the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of a single pen by 8:
Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the amount of carrots that will not be used, we need to calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed to the restaurants and then subtract that from the initial amount.

Given that each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots and there are 40 restaurants, we can calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed as follows:

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, we can find the amount of carrots that will not be used by subtracting the total pounds distributed from the initial amount:

Initial amount = 200 pounds
Total pounds distributed = 80 pounds
Pounds not used = Initial amount - Total pounds distributed = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds

Therefore, the amount of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of children in the city of Soda, we can calculate the difference between the total population and the sum of the male and female populations.

Given:
- Total population = 23786
- Number of men = 8417
- Number of women = 9092

The number of children can be found by subtracting the sum of the male and female populations from the total population.

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
= 23786 - 17509
= 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of PokÃ©mon cards Elaine possesses, we must calculate the number of cards she collected each month and sum them with the initial number.

Initially, Elaine had 20 PokÃ©mon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we first need to establish the number of sentences he edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, we can infer that he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Given that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, his earnings from Publisher A would be 500 * 5 = 2500 cents. 

Publisher B pays Mark twice the rate of Publisher A, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. Consequently, his earnings from Publisher B would be 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we sum his earnings from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7500}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur receives daily, we must first calculate the total number of pails he collects. He acquires 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. Therefore, the total number of pails collected in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Given that each pail contains 5 liters of water, we can calculate the total amount of water collected by multiplying the total number of pails by the volume of water in each pail: 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To determine the total amount John made that year, we must first calculate his new salary after the 5% raise. This can be achieved by computing 5% of his original weekly salary and adding it to his original weekly salary.

The 5% raise is equivalent to 0.05 times his original weekly salary of $2000. Therefore, the 5% raise is 0.05 * 2000 = $100. 

Subsequently, his new weekly salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will have the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year. 

To find the total amount he made that year, we multiply his new weekly salary by the number of weeks he worked:

Total amount made that year = New salary * Number of weeks
= 2100 * 52
= 109200

The total amount John made that year is $109200."
"To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced per year on Josie's 10-acre farm, we must first calculate the total tons of grapes produced annually. Given that each acre yields 5 tons of grapes, we can compute this as follows:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we need to account for the conversion of tons of grapes to barrels of wine. Since each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the total barrels of wine as:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we must first calculate the slices used for each meal and then sum these values.

For the sandwiches, Carl consumed 2 slices of cheese per day for 7 days. Therefore, the total slices used for sandwiches is 2 * 7 = 14.

For the omelets, Carl used 3 slices of cheese per omelet, and he prepared omelets for 3 days. Consequently, the total slices used for omelets is 3 * 3 = 9.

Lastly, Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

To find the total number of slices used, we sum the slices used for each meal: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we must first calculate the total number of blue and red pens she acquired. 

Janet purchased 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens. Therefore, the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 * 9 = 54.

Similarly, Janet purchased 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens. Consequently, the total number of red pens she bought is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of new pens she acquired is the sum of the blue and red pens, which is 54 + 12 = 66.

Janet initially possessed 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, totaling 32 pens.

To find the current total, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she acquired: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we first calculate the total score required for the semester. This is done by multiplying the desired average by the number of tests.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we calculate the total score of the first five tests by summing their individual scores.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows students to exclude the lowest score from the average, we identify the lowest score among the first five tests, which is 71. We then subtract this score from the total score of the first five tests to obtain the total score of the remaining four tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed for the semester.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

The final answer is: $\boxed{291}$"
"To determine the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total distance covered during each period and then sum the results.

First, let's consider the initial four weeks where Michael rode his bike 5 times a week, covering a distance of 25 kilometers each time. The total distance covered during this period is given by the product of the number of times he rode, the distance per ride, and the number of weeks:

25 km/ride * 5 rides/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 km

Next, we consider the subsequent three weeks where Michael rode his bike 2 times a week, covering a distance of 60 kilometers each time. The total distance covered during this period is given by the product of the number of times he rode, the distance per ride, and the number of weeks:

60 km/ride * 2 rides/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 km

To find the total distance covered, we sum the distances covered during both periods:

500 km + 360 km = 860 km

The final answer is: 860"
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we must first calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, then sum these values.

The weight of the chocolate bars can be found by multiplying the number of chocolate bars by their individual weight: 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

The weight of the candied apples is then calculated by multiplying the number of candied apples by their individual weight: 80 * 20g = 1600g.

The total weight of the bag of candy is the sum of the weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose purchased over the three-day period, we must first calculate the number of cakes she bought each day.

On Monday, Rose acquired 4 cakes. 

On Tuesday, she purchased three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cakes by summing the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"To determine the cost of each cup, we first need to establish the total cost of half a dozen plates. Given that each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Next, we are informed that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups equate to 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"To determine the number of times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

"To solve this problem, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2, as Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the local park, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l represents the length and w represents the width.

Given that the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now, we can calculate the time Gary spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. Therefore, the time he spends walking is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. According to the given information, the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, which can be expressed as x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day is 500. Since we know the number of customers on the first and second days, we can express the total as the sum of the customers on the first two days plus the customers on the third day. This can be represented as:

x + (x + 50) + y = 500

However, we are tasked with finding the number of customers on the third day, denoted as y. To isolate y, we can first combine like terms on the left-hand side of the equation:

2x + 50 + y = 500

Subtracting 50 from both sides of the equation yields:

2x + y = 450

We are also given that the total number of customers on the first day is 100. Therefore, we can substitute x = 100 into the equation:

2(100) + y = 450

Simplifying the equation gives us:

200 + y = 450

Subtracting 200 from both sides of the equation yields:

y = 250

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Consequently, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons, as it is stated that the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago.

Given that both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the total amount of water leaked from both pools over the 4-minute period is 16 gallons. Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the small pool after 4 minutes is x - 16, and the amount of water remaining in the big pool after 4 minutes is 2x - 16.

We are also given that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. This can be expressed as the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

However, this is the initial amount of water in the small pool. To find the current amount of water in the small pool, we need to subtract the amount of water leaked, which is 16 gallons. Therefore, the current amount of water in the small pool is 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of hours Lori must work to purchase the desired items, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wishes to acquire. The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the matching belt is $32.00. 

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Next, we divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find the number of hours she must work. Her hourly wage is $8.00.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

Therefore, Lori must work 44 hours to earn enough money to purchase the shoes and the belt.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in monthly installments and then subtract that from the total amount she owes, including the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:
$165/month * 12 months = $1980

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth owes, including the additional 10% interest:
Initial amount borrowed: $2000
Additional 10% interest: $2000 * 0.10 = $200
Total amount owed: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, we can calculate the remaining balance:
Total amount owed: $2200
Amount paid in 12 months: $1980
Remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of dahlias and then add it to the number of roses.

Given that there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can find the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to establish their current ages. Given that Harriet is 21 years old, we can deduce the ages of the other two individuals based on the provided relationships.

Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Furthermore, Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, which gives us Adrian's age as 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now that we have the current ages of the three individuals, we can calculate their ages in three years by adding 3 to each age: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the number of points Jojo scored, we can start by calculating the points scored by the other three students. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. 

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To determine the current water level in the tank, we first need to calculate the amount of water remaining after Celine used 90 liters for her garden. The initial water level in the tank was 120 liters. 

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Next, we are informed that Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as the remaining water. Since the remaining water is 30 liters, the collected rainwater is 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the remaining water and the collected rainwater.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

Therefore, the current water level in the tank is 90 liters.

"To determine the probability of selecting a water type card from James' collection, we first need to calculate the total number of cards after the specified changes.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards, resulting in a total of 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards.

After losing 8 water type cards, the number of water type cards becomes 40 - 8 = 32, and the total number of cards becomes 90 - 8 = 82.

Subsequently, after purchasing 14 grass type cards, the number of grass type cards increases to 20 + 14 = 34, and the total number of cards becomes 82 + 14 = 96.

Now, we can calculate the probability of selecting a water type card as a percentage:

Probability = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
= (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.333...%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability is 33.

"To determine the time required to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we first need to calculate the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place pieces. Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, while her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which is 2 pieces per minute.

Their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates, which is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the time required to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate.

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

"To determine the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months. Given that 30% of the initial 120 watermelons were ready, we can find this value by multiplying 0.3 by 120, which equals 36 watermelons.

Next, we calculate the number of watermelons remaining after two months by subtracting the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the initial total: 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Then, we determine the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we can find this value by multiplying 0.75 by 84, which equals 63 watermelons.

Finally, we calculate the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks by subtracting the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the remaining watermelons: 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the total cost incurred by Mark for the fleet of cars, we must consider the initial purchase price, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

First, we calculate the total cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars, which is 10% of the total cost of the cars. This can be computed as 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Additionally, we need to account for the registration fees, which amount to $1000 per car. Therefore, the total registration fee is 12 cars * $1000 per car = $12,000.

To find the total cost, we sum the initial purchase price, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to establish the number of shells she collected on Monday. Given that Robert collects 20 shells on Monday and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can calculate Kylie's Monday collection as follows:

Kylie's Monday collection = Robert's Monday collection + 5
= 20 + 5
= 25

Next, we need to calculate Kylie's Tuesday collection, which is 2 times her Monday collection:

Kylie's Tuesday collection = 2 * Kylie's Monday collection
= 2 * 25
= 50

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday."
"To determine the total number of insects in the garden, we must first establish the ratio of bugs to ants. It is given that the number of bugs is half the number of ants. 

Given that there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects, we add the number of bugs and ants.

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To determine the number of penguins still sunbathing, we first need to calculate the number of penguins that left the sunbathing area. One-third of the 36 penguins jumped in the ocean, which is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. Another one-third of the penguins went inside the cave to eat their dinner, also equaling 12 penguins.

In total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the sunbathing area. To find the number of penguins still sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs to produce the required amount of tomatoes, we first calculate the total number of tomatoes consumed by Steve and his girlfriend per week. 

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 3 tomatoes per day. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes they consume per week is as follows:

Steve's consumption: 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week
Girlfriend's consumption: 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week
Total consumption: 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week = 63 tomatoes/week

Given that each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can calculate the number of vines required by dividing the total consumption by the yield per vine:

Number of vines = Total consumption / Yield per vine
= 63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine
= 21 vines

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to produce the required amount of tomatoes.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we must first calculate the total number of slices required to accommodate all his friends. Given that there are 20 friends and each friend is to receive 4 slices, the total number of slices required is the product of these two quantities.

Total number of friends: 20
Number of slices per friend: 4
Total number of slices required: 20 * 4 = 80

Since pizzas are sold in slices of 8, we must divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza to find the minimum number of pizzas needed.

Number of slices per pizza: 8
Number of pizzas required: 80 / 8 = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends receives 4 slices.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total number of pens Ram gets, we need to consider the process of refilling pens with ink from empty ones. Given that he can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, we can establish a ratio of 1:5, where one full pen is equivalent to five empty pens.

When Ram buys 25 pens, he can use the ink from these pens to make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens. This leaves him with 5 empty pens. 

Now, he can use the ink from these 5 empty pens to make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen.

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets is the sum of the initial 25 pens and the 5 new pens made from the first 25 pens, plus the 1 new pen made from the 5 empty pens, which equals 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 pens.

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to consider the initial investment and the subsequent growth. 

First, Johnny's initial investment consists of his allowance of $20 and an additional $10, resulting in a total of $30. 

Next, we observe that this sum of $30 triples in a year. To find the final amount, we can calculate the product of $30 and 3.

$30 * 3 = $90

Therefore, the amount of money Johnny had after a year is $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the sum of the ages of the three girls, we must first establish their individual ages based on the given information.

Given that Jessa is 20 years old, we can deduce Joan's age by adding 5 years to Jessa's age, as Joan is five years older than Jessa. This yields Joan's age as 20 + 5 = 25 years.

Next, we calculate Mary's age by subtracting 2 years from Joan's age, as Mary is two years younger than Joan. This results in Mary's age being 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, to find the sum of their ages, we add the individual ages of Jessa, Joan, and Mary: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of students who exited through exit C, we can break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall. 

First, 30% of the students exited through exit A:
30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students exited through exit A.
The remaining students are 1000 - 300 = 700.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students exited through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students exited through exit B.
The remaining students are 700 - 420 = 280.

Therefore, the number of students who exited through exit C is 280.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of candies between John and James, we first establish the number of candies each individual possesses. Given that John has 54 candies, we can infer that Robert has half this amount, as John has twice as many candies as Robert. Therefore, Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Next, we calculate the number of candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's total, as James has 6 more candies than Robert. This yields 27 + 6 = 33 candies for James.

To find the difference in the number of candies between John and James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora, we need to consider the number of books each person reads. Dolly has two books and will read her own two books and Pandora's one book, resulting in a total of 3 books read by Dolly.

Similarly, Pandora has one book and will read her own one book and Dolly's two books, resulting in a total of 3 books read by Pandora.

Therefore, the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora is 3 (by Dolly) + 3 (by Pandora) = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total time Mike spends writing a week, we must first calculate the total number of pages he writes. Since Mike has 3 remaining pen pals, each sending 2 letters a week, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters. Given that each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

As Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages he writes is 30 + 30 = 60 pages.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we first need to calculate the total minutes used for his daily calls and the extra minutes. 

The daily calls consist of 15 minutes per day, and since the month has 30 days, the total minutes used for daily calls can be calculated as follows: 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.

Additionally, Jason has 300 extra minutes of calls this month. Therefore, the total minutes used is the sum of the daily calls and the extra minutes: 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

Now, to find the remaining minutes in Jason's plan, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan: 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of steps.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Therefore, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby then took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

7 = x

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost incurred by Jean, we must first calculate the daily cost of the makeup services, then multiply it by the number of days worked per week, and finally by the number of weeks the movie production lasted.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and requires 6 hours per day. Therefore, the daily cost is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since Jean requires the makeup services 4 times a week, the weekly cost is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

Given that the movie production lasts for 5 weeks, the total cost is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

Following the completion of the movie, Jean receives a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000.

Therefore, the total amount Jean paid is $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the amount each person paid for the party supplies, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party. This involves summing the individual expenses for the cake, birthday presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags.

The total cost is calculated as follows:
Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, there are 3 individuals in total. To find the amount each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 / 3 = $32

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"To determine the total cost of the onions, we first need to calculate the total weight of the onions purchased. The chef acquired 4 bags, each weighing 50 pounds. 

The total weight of the onions is calculated as follows:
Total weight = Number of bags * Weight per bag
Total weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag
Total weight = 200 pounds

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the onions. The cost per pound of onions is $1.50.

The total cost is calculated as follows:
Total cost = Total weight * Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

Therefore, the chef spent $300 on the onions.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate.

Given that Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, the total number of cookies she consumed is 5 + 13 = 18.

Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, she ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, which is 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Therefore, the total number of cookies consumed by Sue is 20 + 26 = 46.

Each cookie has 200 calories. Thus, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

The number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30.

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33.

The number of boys in the third class is 30 - 33 = -3. However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of students.

Given the information provided, the correct answer is not directly calculable due to the inconsistency in the data."

Following the deletion of 9 unused apps, the number of apps on his tablet decreased to 61 - 9 = 52. Subsequently, he downloaded 18 new apps, resulting in a total of 52 + 18 = 70 apps.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed last night and today.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed last night is x + 3. Given that he killed 15 cougars last night, we can set up the equation x + 3 = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 12.

Now that we know the number of cougars he killed today, we can find the number of wolves he killed today. Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is the sum of the wolves killed last night and today, which is 10 + 36 = 46. The total number of cougars killed is the sum of the cougars killed last night and today, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

12 + 6 = 18

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we can find this by calculating 30% of 30 and subtracting it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, we can find the number of times Robert went down the slide by multiplying the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

21 * 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to calculate the number of cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

Number of cows added to each stall = Total cows bought / Number of stalls
= 40 / 10
= 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 * 8
= 192

"To determine the total weight of the redwood, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. Given that the redwood is 200 feet tall, we divide this height by the length of each section, which is 10 feet. This yields 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the redwood by multiplying the number of sections by the weight of each section, which is 400 pounds. Therefore, 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, since termites have consumed 30% of the wood, we must subtract this portion from the total weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 0.3 by 8000, resulting in 2400 pounds. Subtracting this from the total weight gives us 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

The final weight of the redwood is 5600 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we can establish a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of apples that Jamal has as 'J' and the number of bananas that Jamal has as 'B'.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: A = J + 8
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: A = 0.5B
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: B = J + 4

We are also given that Andrea has 52 apples. Substituting this into equation 1, we get:

52 = J + 8

Solving for J, we get:

J = 52 - 8
J = 44

Now that we know Jamal has 44 apples, we can substitute this value into equation 3 to find the number of bananas Jamal has:

B = 44 + 4
B = 48

Now that we know Jamal has 48 bananas, we can substitute this value into equation 2 to find the number of apples Andrea has, which we already know is 52. However, we can use this to verify our results:

52 = 0.5(48)
52 = 24

This confirms that our initial assumption about Andrea's apples is correct.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have:

Total Fruits = (Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples) + (Andrea's bananas + Jamal's bananas)
Total Fruits = (52 + 44) + (24 + 48)
Total Fruits = 96 + 72
Total Fruits = 168

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she is making. She is baking 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are required to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. To do this, we can divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find the number of dozens: 66 / 12 = 5.5.

Now, we can convert 5.5 dozens into a more manageable form. We can express 5.5 dozens as 5 dozen and 6 cookies. Since 6 cookies is half of a dozen, we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Next, we need to calculate the flour required for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. Since 5 dozen cookies require 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour, we can add this to the 1 cup needed for the remaining 6 cookies.

Therefore, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate two thirds of the total number of pennies. 

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we can express this as a mathematical operation: (2/3) * 9,300.

To solve this, we can multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide the result by 3.

First, we multiply 9,300 by 2: 9,300 * 2 = 18,600.

Next, we divide the result by 3: 18,600 / 3 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can find the total dollar amount by multiplying 6,200 by 0.01.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.

Therefore, the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"To determine the total number of marbles Maddison possesses, we must first calculate the initial number of marbles she has. Since she has 5 boxes, each containing 50 marbles, we can find the total by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box.

Initial marbles = 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

Subsequently, Maddison receives 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she now has, we add the initial number of marbles to the marbles she received.

Total marbles = Initial marbles + marbles received

"To determine the total cost of the house, we must consider the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. The selling price of the house is $350,000. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which can be calculated as 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500. Similarly, the transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total cost of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find the difference between the total cost and Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000, we subtract the budget from the total cost: $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to consider the various expenses associated with the transaction. The transfer fees amount to 3% of the selling price, which is $400,000. This can be calculated as 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Additionally, a brokerage fee of 5% of the selling price is also incurred, which is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000. The total fees paid by Mr. Tan are the sum of these two amounts, which is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

To find the net selling price, we subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

However, Mr. Tan still has a remaining loan amount of $250,000 that he needs to pay. Therefore, his net proceeds from selling the house are calculated by subtracting the remaining loan amount from the net selling price: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

"To determine the total time required to cook the chicken, we first need to calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. 

The initial heating time to reach 300 degrees is 20 minutes. To find the additional time required to reach 400 degrees, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes. This is equivalent to 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Next, we need to find the cooking time. It is given that the cooking time is 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Hence, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the heating time to 300 degrees, the heating time to 400 degrees, and the cooking time. This is 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: 71"
"To determine the total expenditure on advertising, we need to calculate the cost of newspaper ads and television ads separately and then sum them up.

The cost of newspaper ads can be found by multiplying the cost per ad ($5) by the number of ads purchased (50). This yields a total expenditure of $5 * 50 = $250.

Similarly, the cost of television ads can be found by multiplying the cost per ad ($75) by the number of ads purchased (15). This results in a total expenditure of $75 * 15 = $1125.

To obtain the overall expenditure on advertising, we add the costs of newspaper and television ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"To determine the number of blue golf balls, we first need to establish the proportion of golf balls to the total number of balls the juggler can juggle. Given that half of the balls are golf balls, we can calculate this as follows:

Total balls = 16
Golf balls = Total balls / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8

Since half of the golf balls are blue, we can then calculate the number of blue golf balls as follows:

Blue golf balls = Golf balls / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4

Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary obtained, we must first calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag. The first bag contains 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it contains 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has a hole in it, resulting in it having half the number of M&Ms as the first bag. Therefore, it contains 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

To find the total number of M&Ms, we add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The final answer is: 762"
"To determine the total number of windows between the houses, we first need to calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each house has 3 bedrooms and each bedroom has 2 windows, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 3 * 2 = 6 per house. With 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

In addition to the windows in the bedrooms, there are 4 windows in each house that are not connected to bedrooms. With 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows, which is 12 + 8 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the change the cashier should give back to the mother, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased and then subtract this amount from the $20 she paid.

The items purchased include cocoa at $4.20, laundry at $9.45, and a package of pasta at $1.35. 

First, we calculate the total cost by adding these amounts together:

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35
Total cost = $14.00

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $20 paid by the mother to find the change:

Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

Therefore, the cashier should give the mother $6.00 in change.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

Therefore, the number of stitches for each sleeve is 315.

The final answer is: $\boxed{315}$"
"To determine the total expenditure on seeds, we must first calculate the individual costs of the tomato and celery seeds. 

The cost of the tomato seeds can be found by multiplying the number of packets by the cost per packet: 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

Similarly, the cost of the celery seeds is calculated as 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

To obtain the total cost, we add the individual costs together: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The total expenditure on seeds is $3200."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of these lines are Sean's, we can calculate his lines as 108 / 3 = 36.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, which can be calculated as (4/5) * 60 = 48.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we can start by finding the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C.

First, we calculate the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes. This is the time required to dig 30 small holes.

Next, we calculate the time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes. This is the time required to dig 15 large holes.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes together to find the total time: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can start by considering their current ages. Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as m. We are given that the sum of their ages is 20, which can be expressed as M + m = 20.

To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages. This can be represented as (M + 10) + (m + 10). 

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: (M + m) + 20. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute this value into the expression to get 20 + 20 = 40.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that we added 20 to the sum of their current ages, not just 10 to each individual age. To correct this, we should add 10 to the sum of their current ages, not 20. Therefore, the correct expression is M + m + 20.

Since M + m = 20, we can substitute this value into the expression to get 20 + 20 = 40. However, we need to add 10 to this sum, not 20. The correct sum of their ages in 10 years is 20 + 20 + 10 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let R represent Ruby's current age and S represent Sam's current age.

From the first statement, we have the equation R = 6S, indicating that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.

The second statement tells us that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be expressed as (R + 9) = 3(S + 9).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides yields:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3 results in:
S = 6

Therefore, Sam's current age is 6 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total amount Peter paid, we must first calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately, and then sum these values to obtain the total expenditure.

The cost of the popsicles can be calculated by multiplying the number of popsicles by the cost per popsicle: 20 * $0.25 = $5.

Similarly, the cost of the ice cream bars is obtained by multiplying the number of ice cream bars by the cost per ice cream bar: 4 * $0.50 = $2.

The total cost is then the sum of the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To determine the total number of spots on the snakes in the park, we first need to calculate the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas separately.

The number of spots on a cobra is given as 70. Since there are 40 cobras, the total number of spots on the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800.

The mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, which means each mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots. With 60 mambas, the total number of spots on the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the snakes by adding the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

To find half the total number of spots, we divide the total by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the total amount Maddy will spend on pizzas, we first need to calculate the total number of individuals she needs to accommodate. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, resulting in a total of 15 individuals from the team and coaching staff. Additionally, each of the 12 team members brings 2 guests, leading to a total of 24 guests. Therefore, the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas required is 39 / 3 = 13.

Given that each pizza costs $15, the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we must first calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces between the gemstones.

Each topaz gemstone is one inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length occupied by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find the number of beads, we need to find the total length of the space between the gemstones. 

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

Now, we subtract the length occupied by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: 25 - 8 = 17 inches. However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: 1.75 / (1/4) = 1.75 / 0.25 = 7.

Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace is 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we first need to calculate the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week. Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories.

The total number of stories written in the first week is the sum of the individual contributions from each of the children. This can be calculated as follows:

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of the children doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. This means Alani's contribution increased from 20 to 40, Braylen's contribution increased from 40 to 80, and Margot's contribution increased from 60 to 120.

The total number of stories written in the second week is the sum of the increased contributions from each of the children. This can be calculated as follows:

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = 120 + 240 = 360

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we first need to establish his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his current age by multiplying Ann's age by 2.

The brother's current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

To find his age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age.

The brother's age in 3 years will be 18 + 3 = 21 years.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left after purchasing a can of pop, we first need to calculate the total value of her initial funds. 

Kelly possesses 5 quarters, each worth 25 cents, resulting in a total of 5 x 25 = 125 cents. Additionally, she has 2 dimes, each worth 10 cents, contributing a total of 2 x 10 = 20 cents to her initial funds.

Combining these values, Kelly's initial total is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Now, we subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from Kelly's initial total to find the amount she has left.

145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Therefore, Kelly has 90 cents remaining after purchasing the can of pop.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of rows of 5-star arrangements on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Given that each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of trucks required to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Given that each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, the total weight can be calculated as follows:

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight per flagstone
Total weight = 80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Next, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks to find the number of trucks needed:

Number of trucks = Total weight / Weight capacity per truck
Number of trucks = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, three trucks will be required to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we first need to establish the speed of the car in the slow lane. Given that it is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, and the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane. The distance covered by both cars is the same, which is 480 miles. Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is:

time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We are given that A = 22 and I = A - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

We are also given that the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. Then, we can write the equation:

T = 10(A + I)
T = 10(39)
T = 390

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: $\boxed{390}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we first calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. Given that there are 8 packets, each containing 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we calculate the number of chocolate bars allocated to the adults. Since each adult receives 6 chocolate bars and there are 4 adults, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars for the children are then 40 - 24 = 16.

To find the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Susan's earnings for the online task, we need to calculate the total time she spends working and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's calculate the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a 3-hour period. However, she takes a half-hour break in between, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

The total time she works is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the total points of the three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, let's establish the points of each player. Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 21 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82.

The final answer is: $\boxed{82}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of oranges washed by the sons and then subtract that from the initial number of oranges purchased.

The oldest son is 8 years old and washes 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. Consequently, he washes 4 oranges.

The total number of oranges washed by the sons is 8 (from the oldest son) + 4 (from the youngest son) = 12 oranges.

Now, to find the number of oranges left unwashed, we subtract the total number of oranges washed from the initial number of oranges purchased: 15 (initial oranges) - 12 (oranges washed) = 3 oranges.

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total count of activities Darren performed over the two days, we need to calculate the number of exercises for each day and then sum them together.

On the first day, Darren completed 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

The total number of activities on the first day is 100 + 50 + 20 = 170.

On the second day, Darren performed 20 more pushups than on the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He also did 10 fewer squats, resulting in 50 - 10 = 40 squats. Furthermore, he doubled the number of dumbbell presses, which is 20 * 2 = 40.

The total number of activities on the second day is 120 + 40 + 40 = 200.

Therefore, the total count of activities over the two days is 170 + 200 = 370.

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To determine the duration a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household with 5 members who consume rice for both lunch and dinner, we first calculate the daily rice consumption.

Each individual consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and with two meals per day, the daily consumption per person is 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg.

For a household of 5 members, the total daily consumption is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption.

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the duration in weeks by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week. Since Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, we only consider the sales from Tuesday to Thursday and the weekend.

The number of crates sold over the weekend is 20. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and on Thursday 18 crates.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

Given that Sam's target is 120 crates, we can now calculate the difference between the target and the total number of crates sold.

Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the total cost of the desk, we need to calculate the sum of the arithmetic series of bids made by the bidders. The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. There are 3 bids made by the other people, and after each of these bids, Carmen also bids, resulting in a total of 6 bids.

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 200, d = 50, and n = 6. Plugging in these values, we get:

S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

The final answer is: $1950"
"To determine the total cost of the driving service for John, we must first calculate the total miles driven per year. Given that his work is 30 miles away and he commutes to and from work each day, the daily mileage is 60 miles. With a 5-day workweek, the weekly mileage is 300 miles. Over the course of 50 weeks in a year, the total mileage is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

The driving service charges $2 per mile, so the total driving cost per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

In addition to the driving cost, John also provides a $150 monthly bonus to the driver. With 12 months in a year, the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Therefore, the total cost per year for the driving service is the sum of the driving cost and the bonus, which is $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To determine the amount of time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. The combined time for these two days is the sum of their individual exercise times.

Combined time = 16 minutes (Monday) + 23 minutes (Sunday) = 39 minutes

Since Peter aims to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we can calculate this by multiplying the combined time by 2.

Twice the combined time = 2 * 39 minutes = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper required for a 32-page tabloid, we can analyze the folding process and the resulting page arrangement.

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper. In a 32-page tabloid, the pages are arranged in a specific manner:

- The first page is on the left back, and the second page is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back, and the 31st page is on the right front.
- This pattern continues, alternating between the left and right sides, until the middle of the paper is reached.

Considering the symmetry of the arrangement, we can observe that each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides. Since the 32-page tabloid has an even number of pages, the middle page (page 16) will be on both the left and right sides.

To calculate the number of pieces of paper required, we can consider the number of pages on each side of the folded paper. Since each side has 16 pages (from page 1 to page 16), we need two pieces of paper to accommodate these pages.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we first need to calculate the total amount she spent at the town fair. 

Annika initially had $50. She spent half of this amount on food and snacks, which is equivalent to 50 / 2 = 25 dollars. Additionally, she spent $10 on rides.

The total amount spent is the sum of the money spent on food and snacks and the money spent on rides, which is 25 + 10 = 35 dollars.

To find the amount of money Annika has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: 50 - 35 = 15 dollars.

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we can start by establishing the number of books sold in the second year. Given that there are 50 unsold books and a total of 250 books, the number of books sold in the second year can be calculated as follows:

Total books = 250
Unsold books = 50
Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books
= 250 - 50
= 200

However, we also know that the number of books sold in the second year is the difference between the total number of books sold over three years and the sum of the books sold in the first year and the current year. Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year, we can represent the number of books sold in the current year as 'x'. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x.

We are given that the number of books sold in the current year is 45. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x = 45

Now, we can calculate the number of books sold in the first year:
Books sold in the first year = 2x
= 2 * 45
= 90

We can now calculate the number of books sold in the second year:
Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold in the first year - Books sold in the current year
= 250 - 50 - 90 - 45
= 65

However, this is not the correct approach. Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the number of books sold in the second year is 65, but we also know that the number of books sold in the second year is the difference between the total number of books sold over three years and the sum of the books sold in the first year and the current year. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Books sold in the first year + Books sold in the current year + Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books
90 + 45 + 65 = 250 - 50
200 = 200

This equation is true, but it does not provide any new information. To find the total amount of money earned in the second year, we need to know the number of books sold in the second year, which we already know is 65. Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:

Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To determine Watson's total earnings for the month of April, we must first calculate his weekly earnings. Given that he works a 10-hour shift each day and earns $10 per hour, his daily earnings are $10/hour * 10 hours/day = $100/day.

Since Watson works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are $100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week.

In addition to his hourly wage, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are $500/week (hourly wage) + $300/week (bonus) = $800/week.

April has 4 weeks, so to find Watson's total earnings for the month, we multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in April: $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the number of people John lost to in the arm wrestling competition, we first need to calculate the percentage of individuals he did not beat. Since he beat 80% of the people, the remaining percentage is 100% - 80% = 20%.

Now, we can find the number of people John lost to by multiplying the total number of people he arm wrestled (20) by the percentage he lost to (20% or 0.20).

Number of people John lost to = 20 * 0.20
= 4

Therefore, the correct answer is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we first need to calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the total loaves produced are sold in the morning. Given that the bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day, we can calculate the morning sales as follows:

60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. This can be calculated by subtracting the morning sales from the total number of loaves produced:

60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Next, we need to determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon. It is given that half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Therefore, we can calculate the afternoon sales as follows:

20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to understand the rate at which Joey loses weight. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 

To find the rate at which Joey loses weight, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can set up a proportion to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. 

Let x be the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Since Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight in the same amount of time as Joey, we can set up the proportion: 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds. 

To find x, we can set up the equation: 2x = 8. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 4. 

However, this is not the correct approach. 

The correct approach is to set up the proportion: 1 week / 4 weeks = 2 pounds / x pounds.

"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the tubs of ice cream. The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $13 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $11 = $22. Therefore, the savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

Next, let's consider the packets of milk. The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 * $1 = $4. The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 * ($1 - $0.5) = 4 * $0.5 = $2. Consequently, the savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk, which is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after 15 days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the growth of extra arms. Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we can calculate the number of extra arms by dividing the total number of days (15) by the interval at which the arms grow (3). This gives us 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Next, we'll consider the growth of extra legs. The person grows an extra leg every 5 days, so we can calculate the number of extra legs by dividing the total number of days (15) by the interval at which the legs grow (5). This gives us 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

Now, we can find the total number of new limbs by adding the number of extra arms and legs together: 5 + 3 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the amount Theo has available for buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to calculate the total expenses incurred prior to gift purchases and subtract the desired savings from his initial budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits at $100 each amounts to 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each amounts to 3 * $50 = $150.

The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times this amount is $500. Therefore, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, we calculate the total expenses incurred so far: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

To find the remaining budget, we subtract the total expenses from the initial budget: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total expenses) = $4050.

Since Theo wishes to save $2000, we subtract this from the remaining budget to determine the amount available for gifts: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

However, this amount is the total available for gifts, not the amount he has to spend. Since he has $2050 available, he can spend up to this amount on gifts.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption.

Combining these amounts, the family consumes 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

Since the family eats eggs every day, we can calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"Given the information provided, we can establish a series of relationships between the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn. Let's denote Quinn's age as Q, Jane's age as J, and Trent's age as T.

We are given that Trent is 5 years older than Jane, which can be expressed as T = J + 5. We are also given that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, which can be expressed as J = Q - 3.

Since we know Quinn's age is 30, we can substitute Q = 30 into the equation J = Q - 3 to find Jane's age. This yields J = 30 - 3 = 27.

Now that we have Jane's age, we can substitute J = 27 into the equation T = J + 5 to find Trent's age. This yields T = 27 + 5 = 32.

Therefore, Trent's age is 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the current age of Noah. Given that Cera is 46 years old and six years ago, she was half as old as Noah, we can deduce that Noah's current age is 46 - 6 = 40 years old. 

Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old. The population of Chile at that time was 3000 times his age, which equals 3000 * 20 = 60000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, we can calculate the current population by doubling the population from six years ago. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120000}$"
"To determine the number of players on the defense, we can establish a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D.

We are told that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is 2D. Additionally, the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, which is D/2.

The total number of players on the team is 105, so we can set up the equation:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combining like terms, we get:

7D = 210

Dividing both sides by 7, we find:

D = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the number of people attending Martha's Christmas party, we first need to calculate the total number of individuals invited. There are 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people.

The total number of people from the 2 families with 6 people is 2 * 6 = 12. 
The total number of people from the 3 families with 4 people is 3 * 4 = 12.

Therefore, the total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people were unable to attend due to illness. This leaves us with 24 - 8 = 16 people.

Additionally, 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't attend due to illness had previous commitments. Since 1/4 of 8 is 2, we subtract these 2 individuals from the remaining 16 people.

Thus, the number of people attending Martha's party is 16 - 2 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we must first calculate the total number of marbles. Initially, the store had 50 marbles. Solomon then acquired 20 marbles from Johanna, resulting in a total of 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

Subsequently, Solomon's father gifted him 2/5 times the number of marbles he purchased from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.

Therefore, the total number of marbles Solomon now possesses is 70 + 8 = 78.

Given that each marble weighs 2 kilograms, the total weight of the marbles can be calculated by multiplying the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156 kilograms.

The final answer is: 156"
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we must first calculate its volume. The pool is a rectangular prism, and its volume can be calculated using the formula V = L x W x H, where L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height.

Given the dimensions of the pool: L = 6 feet, W = 4 feet, and H = 5 feet, we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we can determine the cost of filling the pool by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot, which is $0.1.

Cost = V x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we must first establish the number of girls and nongendered children relative to the number of boys. Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can calculate the number of girls as three times the number of boys, which yields 90 girls. 

Furthermore, the number of nongendered children is one-tenth the number of boys, resulting in 3 nongendered children.

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we sum the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123.

The final answer is: 123"
"To determine the total number of electric poles required to supply electricity in the neighborhood, we can utilize the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This ratio implies that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are necessary.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as x. Consequently, the number of electric wires would be 3x, as per the given ratio.

Given that the total number of electric wires required is 45, we can establish the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the total number of people who left the party. Given that 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate this as 1/4 * 40 = 10 people.

Since there were 22 men remaining, we can infer that 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party. Consequently, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women at the party. Therefore, the number of women remaining is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the cost of the pen, we first need to establish the cost of the magazine. Given that the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book is priced at $4, we can calculate the magazine's cost as follows:

Cost of magazine = Cost of book / 2
= $4 / 2
= $2

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, the cost of the pen can be calculated as:

Cost of pen = Cost of magazine - $1
= $2 - $1
= $1

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we first need to calculate the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes of pencils, each containing an unknown number of pencils, and 2 loose pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as x. The total number of pencils Jam has is given by 3x + 2.

We are also given that Jam and Meg together have a total of 26 pencils. However, this information is incorrect as it contradicts the statement that Jam's sister, Meg, has 46 pencils. Therefore, we will use the correct information that Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils.

The total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2, and the total number of pencils Meg has is 46. Therefore, the total number of pencils they have together is 3x + 2 + 46.

Since we know that Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils, we can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's analyze the impact of the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and we want to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Assuming the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes required as follows:

Temperature difference = 65 degrees
Temperature decrease per ice cube = 13 degrees

Number of ice cubes = Temperature difference / Temperature decrease per ice cube
= 65 / 13
= 5

Now, we know that each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening caused by the ice cubes is:

Weakening due to ice cubes = Number of ice cubes * Weakening per ice cube
= 5 * 12
= 60 milliliters

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid also weakens the coffee, the total weakening caused by the cream is:

Weakening due to cream = 15 milliliters

To find the total weakening of the coffee, we add the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream:

Total weakening = Weakening due to ice cubes + Weakening due to cream
= 60 + 15
= 75 milliliters

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people, we can establish a ratio between the old records and the new records. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

Given that the 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded as follows:

Let x be the number of old records traded. Since the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, we can set up the equation:

2x = 7 * 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 14

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 7

However, this represents the total number of old records traded, not the number of old records each person brought in. To find the number of old records each person brought in, we can divide the total number of old records traded by the number of people:

Number of old records per person = x / 5
Number of old records per person = 7 / 5
Number of old records per person = 1.4

Since we cannot trade a fraction of a record, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the total number of old records, so we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people:

Total number of old records = Number of old records per person * Number of people
Total number of old records = 1.4 * 5
Total number of old records = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to all programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of employees.

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * Total number of employees
= (2/5) * 100
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is the difference between the total number of employees and the number of junior programmers.

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of junior programmers by their monthly salary.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Next, we need to determine the salary of senior programmers. Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we can express their salary as the sum of the junior programmer's salary and the additional amount.

Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of senior programmers by their monthly salary.

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Finally, we can find the total amount paid to all programmers by adding the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers.

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can track the sequence of events:

1. Oscar begins with 24 lollipops.
2. He consumes 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. Subsequently, he distributes 14 lollipops to his friends, resulting in 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops remaining.
4. On his way back home, Oscar purchases twice the number of lollipops he distributed, which is 2 * 14 = 28. Therefore, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. That evening, he consumes 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
6. Finally, Oscar consumes 2 additional lollipops in the morning, resulting in 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final numerical answer is: 31"
"To determine the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we first need to calculate the remaining charge percentage. Since the phone is currently at 60% charged, it requires an additional 100% - 60% = 40% to reach full capacity.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge the remaining 40% by multiplying the remaining charge by the charging rate.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour.

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we must first calculate the total number of lollipops she possesses after receiving an additional 10 from her mother. Initially, Erin has 7 lollipops. Following the transfer of 10 lollipops from her mother, Erin's total becomes 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Subsequently, Erin donates 3 lollipops to Ella. To find the number of lollipops Erin retains, we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops remaining.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the amount the customer paid on their shopping trip, we need to consider the rewards earned from their previous purchase and the application of a coupon.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which entitles them to $1 off for every $20 spent. Therefore, they earned 4 rewards, each worth $1, totaling $4.

On their current shopping trip, they spent $43 and utilized their rewards, resulting in a $4 discount. Additionally, they applied a coupon that offered twice the value of the rewards, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount applied to their purchase is the sum of the rewards discount and the coupon discount, which is $4 + $8 = $12.

To find the final amount paid, we subtract the total discount from the initial purchase amount: $43 - $12 = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we must first calculate the net income for each job, taking into account both the property tax and income tax.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. Since there is no property tax mentioned, we proceed to calculate the income tax. The income tax rate is 20%, so the income tax is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. Subtracting the income tax from the total income yields a net income of $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, resulting in a net income before tax of $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The income tax rate is 10%, so the income tax is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. Subtracting the income tax from the net income before tax yields a net income of $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Comparing the net incomes, we find that Job B offers a higher net pay. To determine the difference, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we first need to calculate the total number of ruined castles. Given that 40% of the 220 castles are in a state of ruin, we can find this by multiplying 220 by 0.4.

220 * 0.4 = 88

Next, we are informed that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we divide the total number of ruined castles by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer. 

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. The total cost of the monthly installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. Adding the advance payment, the total cost of Furniture United's offer is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. The total cost of the monthly installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. Adding the advance payment, the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason requires, we must first calculate the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge separately. 

For the suckers, Mason needs 8 batches, each requiring 30 ounces of sugar. Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers is 8 * 30 = 240 ounces.

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for the fudge, which is 70 ounces per batch. Since Mason is making only one batch of fudge, the total sugar required is 70 ounces.

To find the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we add the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge: 240 ounces (suckers) + 70 ounces (fudge) = 310 ounces.

The final answer is: 310"
"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

The initial price of each share is $8. The stock price increases by 50% in the first year, which can be calculated as 0.5 * $8 = $4. Therefore, the price of each share after the first year is $8 + $4 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%, which is 0.25 * $12 = $3. Consequently, the price of each share after the second year is $12 - $3 = $9.

Given that Maria owns 8 shares, the total value of her shares after the second year is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To determine the difference in the number of hot dogs consumed by John and Luke, we first need to establish the quantities consumed by each individual. 

Luke consumed 2 hot dogs. Thomas, on the other hand, consumed three times the amount Luke did, which is 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

John's consumption is half that of Thomas', which is 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find the difference in consumption between John and Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke consumed from the number John consumed: 3 - 2 = 1.

Therefore, John consumed 1 more hot dog than Luke.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as x. Since the last group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and this total is the sum of the students in all three groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms to simplify the equation:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with the variable:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:

x = 70

Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation H + C = 60.

We are also given that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, which can be expressed as H = 2C.

We can substitute the expression for H from the second equation into the first equation, resulting in 2C + C = 60. Combining like terms, we get 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, yielding C = 20.

Now that we have the value of C, we can find the value of H by substituting C into the equation H = 2C, which gives us H = 2(20) = 40.

Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, the total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of balls Josh has left to juggle after the incident, we need to consider his initial number of balls and the balls that were lost during the performance.

Josh starts by juggling 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. This means he has a total of 3 + 4 = 7 balls.

When Josh drops 3 balls, 2 are caught by the audience, but 1 is lost. Therefore, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle is the initial number of balls minus the number of balls lost, which is 7 - 1 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we must first establish the weights of each animal. 

Let's begin by defining the weights of the animals in terms of the pink frog's weight, which we'll denote as P. Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can express their weights as P = B = T, where B represents the weight of the blue beetle and T represents the weight of the green toad.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so its weight can be expressed as S = P + 10.

The red bird, on the other hand, weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so its weight can be expressed as R = P - 20.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can substitute this value into the equations for the other animals:

B = P = 50
T = P = 50
S = P + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60
R = P - 20 = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal by adding the weights of the animals and the container, which weighs 20 pounds. The total weight is given by:

Total weight = P + B + T + S + R + C
= 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
= 260 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$"

Therefore, Laurel has a total of 87 baby outfits for her child."
"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice. 

The coach wants Tyson to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find this additional distance, we divide the original daily distance by 5. The original daily distance is 5000 meters, so the additional distance is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters.

Therefore, the new daily distance is the sum of the original and additional distances, which is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is the product of the new daily distance and the number of days, which is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"To determine the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we first need to establish the price of each juice box. 

Juice Box A is priced at 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so its price is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. 

Similarly, Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so its price is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

Therefore, the difference in price between Juice Box C and Juice Box B is 2 dollars.

"To determine the total number of legs of the restaurant's tables, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of table and then sum these values.

First, we calculate the number of legs for the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.

Next, we calculate the number of legs for the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of tables to obtain the total: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

The total number of legs of the restaurant's tables is 310."
"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we must first calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband. 

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, which equates to 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week. 

Jenny's husband consumes 1 cookie daily for 7 days, resulting in 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The combined total of cookies eaten by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Given that each bag contains 36 cookies, the number of cookies remaining for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9.

Therefore, Jenny consumes 9 cookies."
"To determine the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 40% of the original price of $30.

The discount can be calculated as follows: 40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to obtain the discounted price of one shirt.

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos purchased 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to find the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in the amount the factory makes per day, we first need to calculate the difference in their daily earnings before and after switching from producing tractors to silos.

The daily earnings from producing tractors were $100 per tractor multiplied by 10 tractors, which equals $1000 per day. 

In contrast, the daily earnings from producing silos are $220 per silo multiplied by 5 silos, resulting in $1100 per day.

The difference in daily earnings is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To express this difference as a percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the factory's daily earnings have increased by 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total annual expenditure on the dog, we must first calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply by 12.

The cost of food per month is calculated as follows: 
Food cost per week = $25
Number of weeks in a month = 4
Food cost per month = $25 * 4 = $100

Next, we add the monthly costs of treats and medicine to the food cost:
Total cost per month = Food cost per month + Treats cost per month + Medicine cost per month
Total cost per month = $100 + $20 + $100
Total cost per month = $220

To obtain the total annual expenditure, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
Total cost per year = Total cost per month * 12
Total cost per year = $220 * 12
Total cost per year = $2640

The final answer is: $2640"
"To determine the total time required for Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

The yoga class on Monday lasts for 1 hour. The cooking class on Tuesday is three times as long as the yoga class, which equates to 3 hours. The cheese-tasting event on Wednesday is a half-hour long, or 0.5 hours. The museum tour on Thursday takes half the time of the cooking class, which is 1.5 hours. Finally, the errands on Friday occupy 2 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time by adding up the duration of each activity:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The total time required for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours.

"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we must first calculate the total number of plant pots she requires. For the daisies, she needs 30 plant pots, and for the roses, she needs twice as many, which is 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots.

Therefore, the total number of plant pots she needs is 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April had already purchased 100 plant pots from the garden center, we can find the number of plant pots she has left over by subtracting the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"

The amount saved can be calculated by subtracting the final amount from the initial amount: $36 - $21 = $15.

Therefore, the amount Andrea saved is $15."
"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we first need to calculate the total time he spent on his activities. 

Let's start by calculating the time spent on boating and swimming. The time spent boating is given as 6 hours, and the time spent swimming is half of that, which is 3 hours. 

Next, we calculate the time spent watching shows. Since there were 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find the total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. Let's denote the total time as 'T'. Then, 30% of T is equal to 6 hours. We can express this as an equation: 0.30 * T = 6.

To find the total time, we can solve for T: T = 6 / 0.30 = 20 hours.

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. This can be expressed as: 0.40 * 20 = 8 hours.

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is 8 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the amount Annabelle still needs to save for the phone, we must first calculate her total earnings from both jobs. 

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work, resulting in a total of $10 * 20 = $200.

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work, resulting in a total of $5 * 15 = $75.

Her total earnings from both jobs are $200 + $75 = $275.

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. To find out how much more she needs, we subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $275 = $125.

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we first need to calculate the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet, and the second tree is 5 feet taller, so its height is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is the sum of their individual heights, which is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

Now, we are given that the height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. Therefore, we can calculate its height by multiplying the combined height of the two shorter trees by 2, which gives us 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the amount of money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent on the toys and then subtract that from the total amount he received.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 = $12
Next, we calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 = $5
Now, we add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears to find the total amount spent: $12 + $5 = $17
Dean initially received $28 and then received an additional $10 from his mother, so the total amount he has is $28 + $10 = $38
Finally, we subtract the amount Dean spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract it from her budget.

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 â‰ˆ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35.

"To determine the amount of money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply it by the number of days she saves.

First, let's calculate the cost of the lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.25, the total cost for 4 lollipops is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Next, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money to find her daily savings. 
Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we can calculate the total savings by multiplying her daily savings by the number of days she saves.
Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

"To determine the amount of candy Billy purchased, we must first establish the amount of money he had remaining after buying the candy. Initially, Billy had $10. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is represented by 1.5x, where x is the number of pounds of candy purchased.

The amount of money remaining after buying the candy is therefore 10 - 1.5x.

Billy then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each. Since he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Subtracting 10 from both sides yields:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

Therefore, Billy purchased 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the age of Carver's son, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the son's age as 'x'. According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This relationship can be expressed as:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To solve for 'x', we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

Therefore, the age of Carver's son is 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of days the train goes between services, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled in one trip. The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 125 miles from the third city to the first city (as 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two segments).

The total distance in one trip is the sum of these three segments: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip three times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 miles * 3 = 900 miles.

The train requires service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

"To determine the amount of stuffing required for Mark's custom dog beds, we first need to calculate the average amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. This can be done by finding the mean of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

The mean is calculated as the sum of the values divided by the number of values. In this case, the mean is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. The amount of stuffing required for 4 chihuahua beds is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds. The amount of stuffing required for 3 collie beds is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed is the sum of the stuffing required for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds, which is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To determine the total duration of John's trip, we must first calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey. 

The initial leg of the trip involves driving to his friend's house, which is 200 miles away at a speed of 70 mph. The distance to his friend's house is augmented by a 10-mile detour, resulting in a total distance of 210 miles. The time taken for this leg can be calculated as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 210 miles / 70 mph
Time = 3 hours

The return leg of the trip involves driving 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this leg can be calculated as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

The total duration of the trip is the sum of the times taken for each leg:

Total Time = Time to friend's house + Time back home
Total Time = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total Time = 6 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to calculate the total number of students present. This can be done by subtracting the total number of absent students from the total number of fourth-graders.

Total number of fourth-graders = 96
Number of absent students = 5 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 9

Total number of students present = 96 - 9
= 87

Next, we can find the number of boys present by subtracting the number of girls present from the total number of students present. To find the number of girls present, we subtract the number of absent girls from the total number of girls.

Total number of girls = 43
Number of absent girls = 5

Number of girls present = 43 - 5

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass, we can calculate the remaining points required by subtracting the points she has already scored from the total required points.

Let's denote the total required points as T, the points scored in the first test as P1, and the points scored in the second test as P2. We are given that T = 42, P1 = 15, and P2 = 18.

The points scored so far can be calculated as P1 + P2 = 15 + 18 = 33.

To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we subtract the points scored so far from the total required points: T - (P1 + P2) = 42 - 33 = 9.

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to pass.

"To determine the number of individuals kicked out of the Walmart for reasons other than refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence, we can establish a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of individuals kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of individuals kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of individuals kicked out for physical violence as V. We are also given that the total number of individuals kicked out is 50.

We know that M = 3, S = 4M - 5, and V = 3S. Substituting the value of S in terms of M into the equation for V, we get V = 3(4M - 5).

Now, we can express the total number of individuals kicked out as the sum of M, S, and V:

M + S + V = 50

Substituting the expressions for S and V in terms of M, we get:

M + (4M - 5) + 3(4M - 5) = 50

Expanding the equation, we get:

M + 4M - 5 + 12M - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

17M - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

17M = 70

Divide by 17:

M = 4.12

However, since M represents the number of individuals, it must be a whole number. We revisit the equation S = 4M - 5 and substitute M = 3, which was given in the problem statement. This yields S = 4(3) - 5 = 7, which is consistent with the problem statement.

We can then find V using the equation V = 3S:

V = 3(7) = 21

Now, we can find the number of individuals kicked out for other reasons, O, by subtracting the sum of M, S, and V from the total number of individuals kicked out:

O = 50 - (M + S + V)
= 50 - (3 + 7 + 21)
= 50 - 31

Let's denote Erin's current points as E and Sara's points as S. We know that E = 3S. Given that Sara scored 8 points, we can substitute S = 8 into the equation E = 3S, which yields E = 3 * 8 = 24. However, we are also given that Erin's current points are 14. 

To find Erin's points before, we need to calculate the difference between the total points Erin had before and her current points. The total points Erin had before can be represented as E + S. Since E = 3S, we can substitute E with 3S, which gives us 3S + S = 4S. We know that S = 8, so 4S = 4 * 8 = 32. 

Now, we can find Erin's points before by subtracting her current points from the total points she had before: 32 - 14 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we must first calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

The cost of the picture frames can be calculated by multiplying the number of seniors by the cost per frame: 44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the picture frames. The etching costs 20% of the cost of each frame, which is $4 per frame. Therefore, the total cost of etching is 44 seniors * $4 per frame = $176.

The total cost of the picture frames and etching is the sum of these two values: $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will receive pins at a cost of $5 per pin, resulting in a total cost of 2 * $5 = $10.

Furthermore, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 11 seniors. Each officer will receive a cord at a cost of $12 per cord, resulting in a total cost of 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of all gifts is the sum of the costs of the picture frames and etching, the pins, and the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To determine the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, we can calculate the materials cost by finding 20% of $400 and subtracting it from the original cost. 

20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

Therefore, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:
50 * 2 = 100

"To determine the total number of apples picked over the three days, we first need to calculate the number of apples picked on each day.

Let's begin by finding the number of apples picked on Monday. Since Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples picked as follows:

Number of apples picked on Monday = Total revenue / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

Next, we are given that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked on each day:

Total number of apples = Number of apples picked on Monday + Number of apples picked on Tuesday + Number of apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50 apples

"To determine the monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating the total amount to be paid, which is the sum of the principal and the interest. The interest is calculated as the product of the principal, interest rate, and time.

Given that the principal is $3,650, the interest rate is 10% or 0.10, and the time is 5 months, we can calculate the total interest as follows:

Total interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Total interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Total interest = $1,825

The total amount to be paid is the sum of the principal and the interest:
Total amount = Principal + Total interest
Total amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total amount = $5,475

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we first need to calculate the total revenue generated from selling the lemonade and then subtract the initial cost of supplies to find the total profit. 

Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, with each pitcher holding 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can produce is 3 * 12 = 36 cups.

Given that she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The initial cost of supplies is $18. Consequently, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can make 36 cups in total, the time required to sell all the lemonade is 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

Therefore, Millie's profit per hour is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. This can be represented by the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2, which is the reciprocal of 2/5:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22

"To determine the number of popsicles each person has, we can utilize the concept of ratios and proportions. Given that the ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6, we can express this as a fraction, 5/6, representing the proportion of popsicles each person has.

The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find the number of popsicles each person has, we can set up an equation based on the ratio. Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x, where x is a common multiplier.

The equation representing the total number of popsicles is 5x + 6x = 165. Combining like terms, we get 11x = 165. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11, yielding x = 15.

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty's popsicles = 5x = 5 * 15 = 75
Sam's popsicles = 6x = 6 * 15 = 90

To find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
Difference = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we must first calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply these quantities by 4.

Total flour required = 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups
Total milk required = 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups

Given that flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we can now calculate the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Number of bags of flour = Total flour required / 2 cups/bag = 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags
Number of bottles of milk = Total milk required / 2 cups/bottle = 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour.

"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner per day. Given that the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour, and it is used for 8 hours a day, the energy consumption per day can be calculated as follows:

Energy per day = Power * Time
= 900 watts * 8 hours
= 7200 watt-hours (Wh)
= 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

If Mel reduces the usage time by 5 hours, the new energy consumption per day is:

New energy per day = Power * New time
= 900 watts * 3 hours
= 2700 Wh
= 2.7 kWh

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new energy consumption:

Energy saved per day = Original energy per day - New energy per day
= 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh
= 4.5 kWh

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30:

Total energy saved = Energy saved per day * Number of days
= 4.5 kWh * 30
= 135 kWh

"To determine the total cost of the ingredients for the muffaletta sandwiches, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Given that each sandwich serves 4 people, we can find this by dividing the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, the total amount of each ingredient needed is equal to the number of sandwiches.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese.

Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

Therefore, the total cost of the ingredients for the muffaletta sandwiches is $50.00.

"To solve this problem, we first establish the initial relationship between the number of corns and cannolis in Allan's house. It is given that there are twice as many corns as cannolis. Since Allan has a total of 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns can be calculated as 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, we consider the additional purchases Allan made. He bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. This implies that he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we can calculate the total number of corns and cannolis in Allan's house by adding the initial quantities to the quantities purchased: 
Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 20
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we can first calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. Since he finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, and he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 5,000 steps.

Additionally, he took an extra 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. Therefore, before his jog, Elliott completed a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Given that he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. This can be expressed as:

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog:

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is 2,000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine the time Toby will arrive at the airport, we first need to calculate the time it takes him to read the book. Given that the book contains 45 pages and each page averages 200 words, the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby's reading rate is 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time it takes him to read the book is 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.

Additionally, it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. Consequently, Toby will arrive at the airport 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes after he begins reading.

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we can calculate the time by which he will arrive early by subtracting the time it takes him to arrive from the time he has to be there: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount paid in May. The company hired 40 employees, each working 40 hours a week for 4 weeks. This results in a total of 160 hours worked by each employee in May. With a wage of $15 per hour, the total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. Consequently, the total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount paid in June. Since 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, resulting in a total of 160 hours worked by each employee in June. With a wage of $15 per hour, the total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. Therefore, the total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

$168,000"
"To determine the amount of money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

The taffy sale can be broken down into two parts: the first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is equivalent to $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

In addition to the taffy, Sally also purchased a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each, totaling 4 x $0.25 = $1.

The total cost of the items Sally bought is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally initially had $10, so the amount of money she has left is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the total amount spent by Tim on fireworks, we first need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and the finale firework. The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that amount, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is the sum of the costs of the two packages, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the fireworks. The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is the original cost minus the discount, which is $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

To find the total amount spent, we add the discounted cost of the fireworks to the cost of the finale firework, which is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she will consume over the 30-day period. Given that she eats 2 cookies per night, we can find this total by multiplying the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights.

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe yields 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can find the number of dozens she needs by dividing the total number of cookies she will eat by the number of cookies her recipe produces.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the intersection of the two conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. This is 5% of the total number of candles, which is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

However, the condition of smelling like wet dog is only applicable to the more dangerous candles, which are 1% of the total number of candles. This is 0.01 * 50000 = 500 candles.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous. This is 5% of the more dangerous candles, which is 0.05 * 500 = 25.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6.

Therefore, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the variables and relationships between the quantities of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister. Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples gathered from the average trees as A, and the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees as S.

Given that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, we have T = 30. Since her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, her sister's contribution from the tallest trees is 2T = 2 * 30 = 60.

From the information provided, we also know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees. Therefore, S = T / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister's contribution from the shortest trees is 3S = 3 * 15 = 45.

Since the average trees are not specified, we'll denote the number of apples gathered from the average trees as A. The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is T + S + A = 30 + 15 + A = 45 + A. The total number of apples gathered by her sister is T + 3S = 60 + 45 = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation: (45 + A) + 105 = 500. Solving for A, we get:

45 + A + 105 = 500
A + 150 = 500
A = 350

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, which implies that the sum of the number of camels and dromedaries is 180. This can be expressed as:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

To solve for the number of dromedaries, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation eliminates the variable D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we have the value of C, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, the number of dromedaries in the herd is 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the trip and sum them together.

First, let's consider the initial four days, during which Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. The total distance covered in this period is the product of the daily distance and the number of days:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we need to calculate the distance traveled over the subsequent two days, which is 30% of the distance covered in the first four days. This can be computed as:
(30/100) * 800 km = 240 km

On the following day, Tom did not travel, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. Since there are seven days in a week, the total distance covered in this period is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we can sum the distances traveled in each segment to obtain the total distance:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final numerical answer is: 3140"
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we can establish a series of proportional relationships between the lockers. 

Let's denote the size of Peter's locker as P, the size of Zack's locker as Z, and the size of Timothy's locker as T. We are given that P = 5 cubic inches.

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can express this relationship as Z = 4P. Substituting the given value for P, we get Z = 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches.

Next, we are told that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, which can be expressed as Z = (1/2)T. Rearranging this equation to solve for T, we get T = 2Z. Substituting the value of Z, we find T = 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches.

Therefore, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the elevation at which Stanley's comb landed, we must consider the initial elevation from which it fell. Given that Stanley was standing at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet, we can calculate the comb's final elevation by subtracting the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation.

Initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, to find the distance Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's current elevation.

Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to consider the initial capital and the funds he received from the two banks. 

First, let's identify the amount of money he received from each bank. The first bank provided $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks by adding the funds from both banks: $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

To find the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To determine the number of cats left on the rock, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats arrived and carried away 5 cats each, resulting in a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats being removed.

The number of cats remaining on the rock after the boats departed is 50 - 20 = 30.

Subsequently, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To calculate the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.

The number of cats left on the rock is the remaining cats minus the cats that ran after the mouse: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break down the cost into distinct periods based on the pricing structure.

The first 6 months are priced at $8 per month, resulting in a total cost of 6 * $8 = $48.

The subsequent 8 months are priced at $12 per month, leading to a total cost of 8 * $12 = $96.

The remaining months, which are 24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months, are priced at $14 per month, resulting in a total cost of 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by summing the costs of each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. Given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can express this relationship as J = T - 6.

We are also given that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can express this as (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Substituting J = T - 6 into the second equation, we get (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6. Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction yields T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we have 3T - 6 = 18. Adding 6 to both sides gives us 3T = 24. Dividing both sides by 3 results in T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans by substituting T = 8 into the equation J = T - 6, which gives us J = 8 - 6 = 2.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and sum them together.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses: 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can accommodate 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses: 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can accommodate 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

Lastly, we calculate the capacity of the minivans: 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can accommodate 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we sum the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we must first establish the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. The homemade bird feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. 

Since Lillian made 3 homemade bird feeders, the total number of birds attracted to these is 3 * 30 = 90. 

The store-bought bird feeders, on the other hand, attract 20 birds each. With 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to these is 3 * 20 = 60.

Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 90 + 60 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. Since it costs 25% more than the bagel, we can express this as a mathematical equation: soup cost = bagel cost + (bagel cost * 0.25). Given that the bagel costs $4, we can substitute this value into the equation: soup cost = 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5.

Next, we need to find the cost of the cake. It is stated that the cake costs half the price of the bagel. Therefore, cake cost = bagel cost / 2 = 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner by summing the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake: total cost = bagel cost + soup cost + cake cost = 4 + 5 + 2 = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To determine the initial number of PokÃ©mon cards Kenny had, we need to consider the amount of money he has available to spend on the amusement park ticket and the price at which he sells the cards.

Kenny has $50 in spending cash and needs $100 to buy the ticket, so he must make $50 from selling the cards. Given that each card is sold for $1.5, we can calculate the number of cards he sold by dividing the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5 = 33.33

However, since Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, the number of cards he sold represents 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.33.

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 PokÃ©mon cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we must first calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared by the caterer. 

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs. This equates to 18 guests having two hotdogs each, resulting in a total of 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs. 

Additionally, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for the remaining half of the guests (also 18) to have one hotdog each, totaling 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs. 

Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 + 18 = 54.

However, when 40 guests arrived, each wanting a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs required is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, the shortage is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Consequently, 26 guests did not receive a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we first need to calculate the number of letters in her sister's name. 

The number of letters in Indras' name is 6. To find the number of letters in her sister's name, we calculate half of this value, which is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, we add 4 to 3, resulting in 7 letters in her sister's name.

The total number of letters in both names is the sum of the letters in Indras' name and her sister's name, which is 6 + 7 = 13.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order, we must first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount is applied. This involves summing the individual costs of the set of pot and pans, the set of mixing bowls, and the five separate utensils.

The set of pot and pans costs $120.00, the set of mixing bowls costs $20.00, and the five separate utensils, each costing $5.00, amount to a total of 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

Therefore, the total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we calculate the discount, which is 20% of the total cost before the discount. This can be computed as 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Finally, we determine the total cost after the discount by subtracting the discount from the total cost before the discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To determine the amount of money Dora needs to purchase the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she wishes to acquire. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Therefore, the total cost is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, which amounts to $18. To find the amount of money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to purchase the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we must first establish the number of dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew.

Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is calculated as 100 * (3/4) = 75.

Prince Walter, wielding a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, employed a nail file to slay one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Consequently, Prince Bruce slew 150 / 5 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed to run her lawnmower, we first need to calculate the volume of gas in one container. Given that 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can find the volume of gas in one container by performing the division 15 / 5.

15 / 5 = 3 gallons

Since 1 gallon is equivalent to 8 pints, we can convert the volume of gas in one container from gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the volume of gas in one container. To do this, we multiply 3 by 1/4.

3 * 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

Now, we convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 0.75 by 8.

0.75 * 8 = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the total amount of money George spent on chips. Since he bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, the total cost of the chips is 3 * 0.40 = $1.20.

Next, we can calculate the amount of money George spent on candy bars. We know that he spent a total of $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. Therefore, the amount of money he spent on candy bars is 0.99 * $5 = $4.95.

Now, we can find the number of candy bars George bought by dividing the total amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar, which is 75 cents or $0.75. The number of candy bars is $4.95 / $0.75 = 6.6.

Since we cannot buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we should consider the fact that George spent $4.95 on candy bars, which is less than 6.6 candy bars at $0.75 each. This means he must have spent less than $5.25 on candy bars. Therefore, the correct number of candy bars he bought is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we first need to calculate the number of lollipops he shared with his friends. This can be found by subtracting the number of lollipops he kept from the total number of lollipops he initially had.

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Next, we need to divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends to find out how many each friend received. Since there are 4 friends, we divide 20 by 4.

20 / 4 = 5

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we first need to calculate the weight of each piece. Given that the cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 equal pieces, we can find the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each consume a piece, the total weight of the cake they eat is equal to twice the weight of a single piece.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges available for distribution. Sitti and Juris collectively possess 34 and 22 oranges, respectively.

The total number of oranges is the sum of the oranges owned by Sitti and Juris:
Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, the total number of individuals receiving the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find the number of oranges each person will receive, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:
56 Ã· 8 = 7

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we must first calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

The amount of onions required is doubled, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 pounds. Given that the onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Additionally, Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, each costing $2.00. Therefore, the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of onions and beef stock, which is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is calculated as the total cost of ingredients divided by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the time difference in departure for Bernadette and Wayne, we need to consider the time it takes for each of them to reach the theater.

Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater as W. Given that it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, we can say W = 4 minutes.

Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater is 4W = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival time. To find the time Bernadette needs to leave, we can calculate her arrival time as 16 minutes (time taken to reach the theater) minus 5 minutes (to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne), which equals 11 minutes before Wayne's arrival.

However, since we want to find the time difference in departure, we need to consider the time Bernadette needs to leave after Wayne. This can be calculated as the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater (16 minutes) plus the 5 minutes she needs to arrive before Wayne, which equals 21 minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to establish the dimensions of the room. Given that the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we must convert the length to feet, as the standard unit of measurement for the perimeter is feet.

Since 1 yard is equivalent to 3 feet, we can calculate the length in feet as follows:
3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

With the length in feet, we can now use the formula for the area of a rectangle to solve for the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room using the formula:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

Therefore, the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each of them has. 

Elizabeth purchased 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has a total of 1 x 20 + 2 x 20 = 60 beads.

Margareth, on the other hand, bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. This gives her a total of 3 x 20 + 4 x 20 = 140 beads.

Now, we can find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters by subtracting the total number of beads Elizabeth has from the total number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the temperature changes caused by the oven and the open window.

The oven is operational for 3 hours, during which it increases the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Consequently, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. The house cools down at a rate of 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, for 30 minutes, the house cools down by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. Combining the temperature increase due to the oven (15 degrees) and the temperature decrease due to the open window (6 degrees), we can calculate the final temperature as follows:

Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Temperature decrease
= 40 + 15 - 6
= 49 degrees

The final answer is: 49"
"To determine the time it took James to complete the run, we must first calculate his total time for the triathlon. Given that Jon's total time is 170 minutes and he won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Next, we need to find James' times for the swim and bike. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, his swim time is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes. Additionally, James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we can calculate James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{59}$"
"To determine the length of Movie A, we first need to establish the length of Movie C, which is given as 1.25 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Next, we are informed that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can calculate its length by dividing the length of Movie B by 4. This yields 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount of change Michael has after purchasing hay for his horse, we must first calculate the total cost of the hay. Given that the horse consumes 1/2 a bail of hay per mile and runs for 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour, we can calculate the total distance traveled.

First, we convert the time from minutes to hours: 30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours.

Next, we calculate the distance traveled using the formula Distance = Speed * Time. Substituting the given values, we get Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse consumes 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay consumed is 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 bails * $3/bail = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, totaling $30. To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she has available. This can be done by adding the number of eggs in the cases to the number of loose eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make with the available eggs. Each glass requires 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Finally, we need to determine how many trays Rozanne can fill with the glasses of eggnog. Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the total number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the current score difference between Joey and Marcy, we need to calculate their respective scores after their turns in the game of Scrabble.

Marcy, on the other hand, starts with 225 points and scores 10 points, resulting in a new total of 225 + 10 = 235 points.

To find the difference in their scores, we subtract Marcy's total points from Joey's total points: 240 - 235 = 5.

Therefore, Joey is winning by 5 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the salesman's profit, we must first calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of the sneakers. 

The revenue from the flash sale on Monday can be calculated as follows: 17 sneakers were sold at $20 each, resulting in a revenue of 17 * $20 = $340.

The remaining sneakers were sold to a department store at $25 each. Since there were 48 sneakers initially and 17 were sold at the flash sale, the number of sneakers sold to the department store is 48 - 17 = 31. The revenue from this sale is therefore 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale, which is $340 + $775 = $1115.

To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost of the sneakers from the total revenue: $1115 - $576 = $539.

The final answer is: $539"
"To determine the total number of crayons Beatrice purchased, we must calculate the number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces each and the packets with 16 pieces each, then sum these quantities.

First, we calculate the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each: 6 * 8 = 48.

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each: 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we sum the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"To determine the regular price of popcorn, let's analyze the given information. We have two options:

1. A movie super ticket for $20, which includes a soda and popcorn for an additional $1.
2. A regular movie ticket for $12, with the option to purchase a soda and popcorn at their respective prices.

Given that the soda costs $3, we can infer that the $1 extra for the super ticket is not solely for the soda. Let's denote the price of the popcorn as 'x'. The total cost of the super ticket is $20, which includes the regular ticket price ($12) and the extra $1 for the soda and popcorn. Therefore, the cost of the popcorn and soda together is $20 - $12 = $8.

Since the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn is $8 - $3 = $5. However, this contradicts the given information that the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra. This discrepancy suggests that the $1 extra is not solely for the popcorn.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. If we buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If we buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to establish the original cost of filling one balloon. Given that the total cost of filling 20 helium balloons was $900, we can set up the equation 20x = 900, where x represents the original cost of filling one balloon.

Solving for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45. This indicates that the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, resulting in a new cost of 45 + 20 = 65 per balloon.

To find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price, we multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11050.

Therefore, the total cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase is $11,050.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11050}$"
"To determine the average speed of the car during the trip, we must first calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours is given by the product of the speed and time, which is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles. Similarly, the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour is 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles. The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances, which is 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

The total time taken for the trip is the sum of the individual times, which is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

The average speed is then calculated as the total distance divided by the total time, which is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

Therefore, the average speed of the car during the trip is 50 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we must first calculate the value of the sapphires she retains and the rubies she acquires through the trade.

Initially, Jenna possesses 8 sapphires. Following the trade, she relinquishes 3 sapphires in exchange for 2 rubies. Consequently, she retains 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires.

The value of the sapphires she retains is 5 * $800 = $4000.

The value of the rubies she acquires is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is therefore $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy consume in a 30-day period, we must first calculate their combined daily consumption. Since each individual consumes 4 apples per day, their combined daily consumption is 4 + 4 = 8 apples.

Now, to find the total number of apples consumed over 30 days, we multiply their combined daily consumption by the number of days:

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

Therefore, Marin and Nancy consume a total of 240 apples in 30 days."
"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the volume of soil required for the raised beds. Each bed is a rectangular prism with dimensions 2 feet in width, 8 feet in length, and 2 feet in height. The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

For one bed, the volume is V = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume of soil required by the volume of one bag: 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

The cost of each bag is $12. Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To determine the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Given that there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can express this as an equation:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of Number of red cards
= 15 + 0.6 * 15
= 15 + 9
= 24

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by summing the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of fairies remaining, we need to analyze the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn observed 50 fairies. Subsequently, one of her friends noticed half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the existing group. This implies that 25 fairies joined the group, resulting in a total of 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

Following this, 30 fairies flew away. To find the number of fairies remaining, we subtract the number of fairies that departed from the total: 75 - 30 = 45.

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies. This can be done by summing the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has and the number of puppies Brandon's dog has.

Total puppies = 8 (Jennifer's dog) + 12 (Brandon's dog) = 20

Next, we calculate the total number of puppies with spots by adding the number of spotted puppies from both dogs.

Total puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's dog) + 4 (Brandon's dog) = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the percentage of puppies with spots is 35%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make to transport the feed, we must first calculate the total weight of the feed. This involves summing the weights of the sugar cubes, carrots, hay, and oats.

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds, as the farmer purchases two 1-pound boxes. The weight of the carrots is 48 pounds, given that he buys four 12-pound bags. The weight of the hay is 3150 pounds, as he purchases forty-two 75-pound bales. Lastly, the weight of the oats is 1300 pounds, as he buys twenty 65-pound sacks.

The total weight of the feed is therefore 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

To find the number of trips required, we divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the farm truck, which is 2250 pounds. This yields 3400 / 2250 = 1.511. Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we must round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we first need to calculate the total value of the aluminum cans and plastic bottles she recycles in a week. 

The value of aluminum cans is calculated as follows: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week. 
The value of plastic bottles is calculated as follows: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

The total weekly earnings from recycling are the sum of the value of aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the total monthly earnings by multiplying the weekly earnings by 4: 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we first need to calculate the number of plants Toni has. Given that Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can express this relationship as:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we can find the number of plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's total:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"

"To determine the amount of change Theo received, we first need to calculate the cost of the paper. Since it costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen, we can express this as 3p - 1, where p is the price of the pen. Given that the price of the pen is $2, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the cost of the paper: 3(2) - 1 = 6 - 1 = $5.

The total cost of the pen and the paper is the sum of their individual prices, which is $2 + $5 = $7.

Since Theo gave the cashier $10, the change she received is the difference between the amount she paid and the total cost of the items: $10 - $7 = $3.

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is $3."
"To determine the number of pencils left at the end of the year, we first calculate the total number of pencils initially in the class. Given that there are 30 students, each with 10 pencils, the total pencils initially can be calculated as follows:

Total pencils initially = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

Next, we find the number of pencils used after two months. Since 1/5 of the total pencils were used, we can calculate this as:

Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils

The remaining pencils after two months can be found by subtracting the used pencils from the initial total:

Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

Finally, to determine the number of pencils left at the end of the year, we calculate 1/3 of the remaining pencils:

Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we first need to calculate the combined length of the remoras. Since the remoras are 6 inches long and there are two of them, we convert the length from inches to feet for consistency with the shark's length.

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

Therefore, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of students at the grade level, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, which is equal to one-fourth of the total number of students.

We can express this relationship as an equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to isolate x:
x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, the total number of students at the grade level is 80.

"To determine the number of books each child received, we first calculate the total number of books purchased by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since the books were distributed equally among the 4 children, we divide the total number of books by 4 to find the number of books each child received.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who are not allergic to anything, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle allows us to calculate the total number of kids allergic to dairy, peanuts, or both, and then subtract this value from the total number of kids in the class.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, which gives us 9 + 6 = 15. However, since 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts, we have double-counted these individuals. To correct for this, we subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the sum, resulting in 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can subtract the number of kids allergic to dairy, peanuts, or both from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything: 32 - 12 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of individuals participating in the tour, we must first calculate the total number of employees and then add the number of tour guides.

There are 3 groups of 200 employees, so the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Each group is assigned 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups, so the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is 600 (employees) + 21 (tour guides) = 621.

"To determine the total cost of the trip, we first need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for two individuals is $5000 each, resulting in a total of 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel's normal price is $1500 per day. However, due to it being a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. To find the new price, we calculate 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To determine the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he possesses.

Jasper's blue paint tubes can be calculated by dividing the number of Ben's blue paint tubes by 2, as Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben. Given that Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Similarly, Jasper's yellow paint tubes can be calculated by multiplying the number of Ben's yellow paint tubes by 3, as Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Given that Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Therefore, Jasper has a total of 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to establish the weight of the 2010 penny. Given that it is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can express this relationship as a mathematical equation.

Let's denote the weight of the 1959 penny as W. The weight of the 2010 penny is then (3/4)W.

We are given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. Therefore, we can substitute W = 48 into the equation for the weight of the 2010 penny:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weights of the 1959 and 2010 pennies:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
= 48 + 36
= 84 grains

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the remaining amount required to reach their goal, we first calculate the total amount earned by Keegan and Tasha. This can be done by adding their individual earnings.

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tasha's earnings: $91
Total earnings: $83 + $91 = $174

Next, we subtract the total earnings from the goal amount to find the remaining amount needed.

Goal amount: $200
Remaining amount needed: $200 - $174 = $26

Therefore, Keegan and Tasha need to earn an additional $26 to reach their goal.

"To determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to calculate the number of oranges he consumed. Given that they picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them, we can find this by multiplying 60 by 2/5.

First, we multiply 60 by 2 to get 120. Then, we divide 120 by 5 to find the number of oranges Stetson ate. 

120 / 5 = 24 oranges.

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we can find the total amount by multiplying the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.

24 oranges * $10/orange = $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the cost of Jillian's handbag, we can establish a relationship between the cost of the handbag and the cost of her shoes. Let's denote the cost of the shoes as S and the cost of the handbag as H.

Given that the handbag costs $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes, we can express this relationship as:

H = 3S - 20

We are also given that the cost of the shoes, S, is $80. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

H = 3(80) - 20
H = 240 - 20
H = 220

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

"To determine the total hours James runs in a week, we first need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week. Given that he runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, we can calculate this as follows:

Total miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
= 60 miles/week

Now, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles run in a week by his speed of 10 miles per hour.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

Therefore, James runs 6 hours a week."
"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we must first calculate the total amount of oats consumed by his horses in a day. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, resulting in a daily consumption of 5 * 2 = 10 pounds per horse.

With four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds. To find the total consumption for five days, we multiply this amount by 5, yielding 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total consumption by the weight of a single bag to find the number of bags needed: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben requires 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to calculate the total number of Pomeranians. Given that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of puppies.

Let's denote the total number of puppies as P. We know that two thirds of P is equal to the number of Pomeranians. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

(2/3)P = Number of Pomeranians

We are given that the total number of puppies is 27. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

(2/3)(27) = Number of Pomeranians
18 = Number of Pomeranians

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of Pomeranians.

Let's denote the number of girl Pomeranians as G. We know that one third of the Pomeranians is equal to G. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

(1/3)(Number of Pomeranians) = G

Substituting the value of the number of Pomeranians, we get:

(1/3)(18) = G
6 = G

Therefore, the number of girl Pomeranians is 6.

"To calculate the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to first find the sum of their highest temperatures and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48Â°F, in Northlandia is 21Â°F, and in Midlandia is -3Â°F.

First, we add the temperatures: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Then, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3: -30 / 3 = -10

Therefore, the average highest temperature of the three countries is -10Â°F."
"To determine the number of days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we first need to calculate the remaining amount by subtracting the amount already saved from the total cost of the toy car.

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Next, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount.

Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount.

"To determine the total amount Sally spent, we first need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it costs three times as much as the small pizza, we can express this relationship as a multiplication of the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Given that the cost of the small pizza is $8, we can calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows:

Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * Cost of small pizza
= 3 * $8
= $24

Now, to find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza.

Total amount spent = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza

"To determine the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we must first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

The razors are buy one get one free, so Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors, which costs $4.00. Additionally, she has a $2.00 coupon, resulting in a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the total height of the human pyramid, we must calculate the height of each level and sum them up. 

The bottom layer consists of 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall. Their combined height is 4 * 64 = 256 inches.

The next layer consists of 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, on top of the bottom layer. Their combined height is 3 * 64 = 192 inches.

The subsequent layer consists of 2 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, on top of the second layer. Their combined height is 2 * 64 = 128 inches.

The top layer consists of the shortest cheerleader, who is 60 inches tall.

Now, we sum up the heights of all the layers: 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 536 inches.

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536 / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44.67}$"

A + 4 = 3(B)

We are also given that Brett is currently 14 years old, so we can substitute B = 14 into the equation:

A + 4 = 3(14)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

A + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we get:

A = 38

Therefore, Angela's current age is 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To determine the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides can be calculated as the product of the number of days and the cost per ride, which is 14 days * $6 per day = $84.

Similarly, the cost of the afternoon rides is 14 days * $2 per day = $28.

Therefore, the total cost is the sum of the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides, which is $84 + $28 = $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"To determine the number of Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges they have. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, resulting in a total of 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne, on the other hand, brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, which means she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Combining their oranges, they have a total of 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie requires three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie: 120 / 3 = 40.

Therefore, the total number of Greek orange pies they can make is 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200 plus an additional $5 per guest for food, resulting in a total cost of 200 + 5x. 

The cost of the second venue is a per-person charge of $25, which includes the cost of food.

To find the break-even point, we equate the costs of the two venues:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides of the equation yields:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

10 = x

Therefore, the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We are also given that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

The total number of insects collected by the three is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combining like terms, we get 2B + 7 = 43. Subtracting 7 from both sides yields 2B = 36. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we first need to calculate the yards used by each of them. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find the yards used by Mariah, we can multiply the fraction of the skein used by the total yards in a skein:

1/4 * 364 = 91 yards

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find the yards used by her grandma, we can multiply the fraction of the skein used by the total yards in a skein:

1/2 * 364 = 182 yards

Now, we can find the total yards used by adding the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together:

91 + 182 = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and then add the 10 random gifts.

First, we calculate the number of gifts for the friends who want 5 gifts each. There are 2 friends in this category, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 2 * 5 = 10.

Next, we calculate the number of gifts for the friends who want 2 gifts each. There are 3 friends in this category, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 3 * 2 = 6.

Now, we add the number of gifts for both categories to find the total number of gifts for her friends: 10 + 6 = 16.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts to the total number of gifts for her friends to find the overall total: 16 + 10 = 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"Given that the chair's width is 3 feet, we can determine the rug's width by adding 5 feet to the chair's width, as the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Therefore, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Next, we calculate the couch's length by first finding twice the width of the rug, which is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Then, we add 2 feet to this value to obtain the couch's length, resulting in 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

We are given that the total cost is $7. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood yields the most sticks per dollar. 

Let's calculate the number of sticks per dollar for each type of wood. A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50. On the other hand, a 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67.

Since 66.67 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1600}$"
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we must first calculate the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has four legs and Mario has six dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Given that each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To determine the weekly expenditure on bus trips, we can calculate the cost of one bus trip and then multiply it by the number of trips taken in a week. 

The cost of one bus trip is $2.20. Since Janet takes two bus trips five days a week, the total number of trips in a week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we can calculate the total weekly expenditure on bus trips: 2.20 * 10 = 22.00

To find the amount saved by purchasing a weekly bus pass for $20, we subtract the weekly bus pass cost from the total weekly expenditure on bus trips: 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To determine the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo, we need to establish the number of animals at each location. 

First, we are given that the farm has 30 cows. Additionally, it is stated that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, which implies the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

Furthermore, we are informed that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, resulting in a total of 40 animals. The zoo, on the other hand, has 60 cows and 20 sheep, totaling 80 animals.

Therefore, the combined total of animals at the farm and the zoo is 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the quantities of onions and potatoes purchased by Sophia and Rose. Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'.

Given that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can express this relationship as an equation: x + y = 4(x + y). However, this equation is not necessary to solve the problem. Instead, we can directly use the information that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up a proportion to find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We can set up the proportion as follows:

x / (x + y) = 1 / 4
12 / (x + y) = 1 / 4

Cross-multiplying, we get:
4x = x + y
3x = y

We know that Rose bought 4 potatoes, so we can substitute y = 4 into the equation 3x = y:
3x = 4
x = 4 / 3

However, this is not the correct approach. Let's re-evaluate the problem. We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the equation as follows:

x + y = 4(x + y)
12 + 4 = 4x + 4y

Simplifying the equation, we get:
16 = 4x + 4y

Divide both sides by 4:
4 = x + y

Since we know that x + y = 4, we can set up the equation as:
x + y = 4
12 + 4 = 4x + 4y
16 = 4x + 4y
4 = x + y

"To determine the required daily calorie deficit for Andy to reach his weight loss goal, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has available to achieve this goal. Given that his birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

Since Andy aims to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 201 â‰ˆ 522 calories per day.

The final answer is: 522"
"To determine Gerald's remaining funds, we must first calculate his total earnings for the week. Given that he earns $30 per day and works for 7 days, his weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * Number of working days
= $30/day * 7 days
= $210

Subsequently, to find out how much Gerald has left after spending $100, we subtract the amount spent from his total earnings:

Remaining funds = Weekly earnings - Amount spent
= $210 - $100
= $110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total distance she will run. Given that she is required to run 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, we can find the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink by multiplying the total distance by the amount of water she needs to drink per kilometer.

Total water = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 120 milliliters of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the amount of money Julie had left after her purchases, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the amount spent on clothes, which is 20% of the initial $500. This can be computed as 0.20 * $500 = $100. Consequently, the remaining money after buying clothes is $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, we calculate the amount spent on CDs, which is 25% of the remaining $400. This can be computed as 0.25 * $400 = $100. Therefore, the remaining money after buying CDs is $400 - $100 = $300.

Hence, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a relationship between the cost of the house and the cost of the lot. Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house can be expressed as 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000. To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4, yielding x = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can calculate the cost of the house as 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To determine the profit earned by Tara on her canvas bags, we first need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of packs of canvas bags by the number of bags per pack and the cost per pack. In this case, there are 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, each costing $4. Therefore, the total cost is 8 * 5 * $4 = $160.

Next, we calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of bags sold by the selling price per bag. Tara sold each bag for $8, and she sold a total of 8 * 5 = 40 bags. Thus, the total revenue is 40 * $8 = $320.

The profit earned by Tara can be found by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. Therefore, the profit is $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw during the fight, we first need to calculate the total duration of the fight in minutes. Given that the fight consists of 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes, the total duration is the product of the number of rounds and the duration of each round, which is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Next, we can calculate the total number of punches thrown by multiplying the total duration of the fight by the average number of punches thrown per minute, which is 25. Therefore, the total number of punches thrown is 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: $\boxed{375}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of cookies made by each individual. Let's denote the number of cookies made by Josh as J, the number of cookies made by Kelsie as K, and the number of cookies made by Suzanne as S.

Given that Suzanne made 36 cookies, we have S = 36.

It is also stated that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, so we can express this as J = S / 4. Substituting the value of S, we get J = 36 / 4 = 9.

Furthermore, it is mentioned that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, which can be expressed as K = 2J. Substituting the value of J, we get K = 2 * 9 = 18.

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Ali initially has. He possesses four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total money from the $10 bills is 4 * $10 = $40, and the total money from the $20 bills is 6 * $20 = $120. Therefore, the total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Next, Ali gives his sister half of the total money. This can be calculated as $160 / 2 = $80. Consequently, the amount of money left after giving his sister half is $160 - $80 = $80.

Subsequently, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of the remaining money, we multiply $80 by 3/5, which yields (3/5) * $80 = $48. Therefore, the amount of money left after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

The final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $32."
"To determine the time it takes Royce to shingle a house, we first need to convert Rob's time from hours to minutes. Given that Rob takes 2 hours, we can calculate this as 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Now, we know that Royce takes double the time it takes Rob to shingle a house, plus an additional 40 minutes. Mathematically, this can be represented as: Royce's time = 2 * Rob's time + 40 minutes.

Substituting Rob's time (120 minutes) into the equation, we get: Royce's time = 2 * 120 + 40 = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

Therefore, the time it takes Royce to shingle a house is 280 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool required, we must calculate the total amount needed for each item and then sum these values.

For the hats, 3 children will require 3 * 2 = 6 skeins of wool.

For the scarves, 3 children will require 3 * 4 = 12 skeins of wool.

For the sweaters, 3 children will require 3 * 12 = 36 skeins of wool.

For the mittens, 3 children will require 3 * 1 = 3 skeins of wool.

For the socks, 3 children will require 3 * 2 = 6 skeins of wool.

Now, we sum the total number of skeins needed for each item: 6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins.

The final answer is: 63"
"To determine the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then subtract that from the total number of problems.

First, let's calculate the number of problems Chris completed on Tuesday. Since he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, and he completed 12 problems on Monday, the number of problems completed on Tuesday is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of problems completed by Tuesday is the sum of the problems completed on Monday and Tuesday, which is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of problems Chris has to complete is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

Next, let's calculate the number of problems Chris completed on Wednesday. He completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13.

The total number of problems completed by Wednesday is the sum of the problems completed on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, which is 12 + 36 + 13 = 61.

The number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 100 - 61 = 39.

The final answer is: $\boxed{39}$"
"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm, we need to calculate the individual rates at which each of them can pick strawberries and then sum these rates.

Tony's rate is given as 6 quarts per hour. 

Bobby's rate is one quart less than Tony's, so it is 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy's rate is twice that of Bobby's, which is 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky's rate is two quarts less than Kathy's, so it is 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we can sum the individual rates to find the total rate at which they can pick strawberries per hour: 6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread left, we must first calculate the total number of loaves sold. The bakery sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, resulting in a total of 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold.

Next, we need to account for the 6 loaves returned by the grocery store. To find the number of loaves left, we subtract the total number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the initial number of loaves baked.

Total loaves left = Initial loaves baked - (Total loaves sold + Loaves returned)
Total loaves left = 200 - (132 + 6)
Total loaves left = 200 - 138
Total loaves left = 62

The number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"To determine the number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for each type of tulip separately and then sum the results.

For the red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6

For the blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. 

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins required for each batch of cookies.

First, let's calculate the number of cups of raisins allocated to the granola and snack mix. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the three items, each of them will receive 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Next, we'll find the number of cups of raisins remaining for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. Therefore, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be allocated to the oatmeal cookies.

Now, we'll determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies that can be made. Each batch requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find the number of batches, we'll divide the number of cups of raisins allocated to the oatmeal cookies by 3/4.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

First, let's calculate the daily and weekly consumption before adding the device. Given that Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, her weekly consumption is 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour.

The cost of electricity per kilowatt hour is $1.50. Therefore, the weekly cost before adding the device is 84 * $1.50 = $126.

Next, we calculate the daily and weekly consumption after adding the device. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so the total daily consumption becomes 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Consequently, the weekly consumption is 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour.

The weekly cost after adding the device is 98 * $1.50 = $147.

To find the difference in weekly electric bill, we subtract the cost before adding the device from the cost after adding the device: $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we first need to establish the rate at which a single individual can paint a house. Given that one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can infer that their rate of work is 0.5 houses per 5 days.

To find the rate of work per day for one person, we divide the rate of work by the number of days: 0.5 houses / 5 days = 0.1 houses per day.

Now, we can calculate the combined rate of work for 5 people: 5 people * 0.1 houses per day per person = 0.5 houses per day.

Since we want to find the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can divide the total work (1 house) by the combined rate of work: 1 house / 0.5 houses per day = 2 days.

Finally, we convert the time from days to hours: 2 days * 24 hours per day = 48 hours.

Therefore, the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is 48 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna possess. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as C and the number of sofas as S. We are given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so we can express this as S = C - 2.

We are also given that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, which can be expressed as J = 3C, where J represents the number of chairs Jenna has. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can express the number of sofas Jenna has as J - 2.

Given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can substitute this value into the equation S = C - 2 to find the number of chairs Ophelia has: 20 = C - 2, which yields C = 22.

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has by multiplying this value by 3: J = 3 * 22 = 66.

To find the number of sofas Jenna has, we subtract 2 from the number of chairs she has: J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64.

Now that we have the number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna, we can calculate the total number of pieces of furniture they have. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, for a total of 20 + 22 = 42 pieces. Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, for a total of 64 + 66 = 130 pieces.

The total number of sofas and chairs is the sum of the total number of pieces Ophelia and Jenna have: 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"To determine the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he spent on the headphone set.

Given that Tom spent a total of $48 and the CD costs $4, the amount spent on the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

Total money spent = $48
Money spent on the CD = $4
Money spent on the headphone set = Total money spent - Money spent on the CD
Money spent on the headphone set = $48 - $4 = $44

Next, we can calculate the number of CDs Tom could have purchased with the money spent on the headphone set.

Money spent on the headphone set = $44
Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = Money spent on the headphone set / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought = $44 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 11

Now, we can calculate the number of CDs Tom could have purchased with the money spent on both the headphone set and the CD.

Total money = $48
Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = Total money / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought = $48 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 12

To find the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we subtract the number of CDs purchased with the CD alone from the number of CDs purchased with both the CD and the headphone set.

Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = Number of CDs that could have been bought - Number of CDs that could have been bought
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 12 - 1
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 11

However, this is the number of CDs that could have been bought with the money spent on the headphone set alone. To find the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased, we need to subtract 1 from this number, as he would have still bought the CD.

Number of additional CDs = Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set - 1
Number of additional CDs = 11 - 1
Number of additional CDs = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to consider the varying hours he spent each week. 

There are 6 weeks where Josh spent 4 hours working out. The total hours for these weeks can be calculated as 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Additionally, there are 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours each, resulting in a total of 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Lastly, there is 1 week where he spent 6 hours working out, contributing 6 hours to the total.

To find the overall total, we sum the hours from each category: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Next, we need to determine the number of passengers who get on at the second stop. It is stated that 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 21 passengers got off, 3 times this number is 3 * 21 = 63. However, this represents the difference between the number of passengers who got off and the number who got on. Since we are looking for the number of passengers who got on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. This results in a negative number, indicating that more passengers got on than got off. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that 63 more passengers got on than got off, meaning 21 + 63 = 84 passengers got on.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 (left) + 84 (got in) = 143.

The final answer is: $\boxed{143}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables and setting up an equation based on the given information.

Let J be Jame's current age and C be his cousin's current age.

From the problem statement, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is J = 27 - 5 = 22 years.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. This can be expressed as:

C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 8 = 2J + 16 - 5
C + 8 = 2J + 11
C = 2J + 3

Now, we can substitute the value of J into the equation to find C:

C = 2(22) + 3
C = 44 + 3
C = 47

Now that we have the current ages of Jame and his cousin, we can find the difference between their ages:

Difference = C - J
          = 47 - 22
          = 25

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the cost of one monitor, we can start by finding the cost of the printer. Given that the printer costs $400 less than the computer, and the computer costs $1,100, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we can find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of seashells brought by each girl, we first need to calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys and each boy brought 60 seashells, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

Next, we need to find the number of seashells brought by the girls. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as 60 + 4 * 60.

First, we calculate 4 * 60, which equals 240. Then, we add 60 to this result, giving us 60 + 240 = 300. Therefore, the girls brought 300 more seashells than the boys.

To find the total number of seashells brought by the girls, we add the number of seashells brought by the boys to the additional seashells brought by the girls. This gives us 600 + 300 = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the initial relationship between the number of candies Nick and George have. Let's denote the initial number of candies George has as x. Since Nick has twice as many candies as George, the initial number of candies Nick has is 2x.

We are given that George ate 5 candies, and now he has 3 candies left. This implies that the number of candies George had initially (x) minus the number of candies he ate (5) equals the number of candies he has left (3). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

x - 5 = 3

To find the value of x, we can solve this equation by adding 5 to both sides:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the initial number of candies Nick had by multiplying x by 2:

Initial number of candies Nick had = 2x
= 2 * 8
= 16

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Anne's age, we first need to establish Alyana's age, as it is given that she is 4 years younger than Chenny. Given that Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Next, we can determine Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age, as it is stated that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book individually and then sum them up.

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's calculate the total thickness of the four books:
31 + 50 = 81
81 + 45 = 126
126 + 62 = 188

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{188}$"
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we need to calculate the difference between her target and the vlogs she has already created.

Emma's monthly target is 72 vlogs. She has created 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. To find the total number of vlogs she has created so far, we add these values together:

18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, we subtract the total number of vlogs created from her monthly target to find the number of vlogs she needs to make:

72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma should create 18 more vlogs to meet her monthly goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the total amount paid, we first need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. This can be done by multiplying the bill by 0.20, which represents 20% as a decimal.

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Next, we add the calculated tip to the original bill to obtain the total amount paid.

Total amount = $50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

Therefore, the total amount paid is $60."
"To determine the final amount the eldest boy has, we can break down the problem into a series of steps.

First, we need to find the initial amount the eldest boy received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we can calculate his initial share as follows:

Initial share = Total amount / Number of boys
Initial share = $18 / 3
Initial share = $6

Next, we need to account for the additional money the eldest boy received. He added $5 to his initial share, resulting in:

New amount = Initial share + $5
New amount = $6 + $5
New amount = $11

The following day, he added another $10 to his new amount:

New amount = $11 + $10
New amount = $21

However, he then spent $8 from his total, leaving him with:

New amount = $21 - $8
New amount = $13

Finally, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8:

Final amount = New amount * 3
Final amount = $13 * 3
Final amount = $39

The final answer is: $39"
"To determine the daily savings amount for Elvis in the second half of April, we can start by establishing the relationship between the savings in the first and second halves of the month. Let's denote the number of days in the first half of April as x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

We are given that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. If we let y be the daily savings amount in the first half, then the daily savings amount in the second half will be 2y.

The total savings in the first half of the month is xy, and the total savings in the second half is 2xy. The total monthly savings is the sum of the savings in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation 3xy = 1125.

Since x is the number of days in the first half, and the total number of days in April is 30, we can write x + (30 - x) = 30, which simplifies to 30 = 30. This equation is true for any value of x, but we can use it to find the value of x. We know that x + (30 - x) = 30, and we also know that the total number of days in April is 30. Therefore, we can write x = 30 / 2 = 15.

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the equation 3xy = 1125 to find y: 3(15)y = 1125, which simplifies to 45y = 1125.

To find y, we divide both sides by 45: y = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the daily savings amount in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the change Verna received after purchasing fruits, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the amount she gave.

The cost of five oranges at $0.80 each is 5 * $0.80 = $4.
The cost of six peaches at $0.75 each is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we first need to calculate their individual totals. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, and he completed 20 tasks. Therefore, his total earnings can be calculated as follows:

Jairus' total = 0.8 * 20 = $16

Similarly, Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, and she also completed 20 tasks. Her total earnings can be calculated as follows:

Jenny's total = 0.5 * 20 = $10

Now, we can find the difference between Jairus' total and Jenny's total to determine how much more Jairus will earn than Jenny.

Difference = Jairus' total - Jenny's total = 16 - 10 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the amount Jeff receives, we can establish a relationship between the amounts received by Jeff and Brad. Let's denote the amount Brad receives as x. Since Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's amount can be expressed as 4x.

The total amount to be divided between them is $100. Therefore, the sum of their individual amounts is equal to $100. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 20

Now that we know Brad receives $20, we can determine Jeff's amount by multiplying Brad's amount by 4:

Jeff's amount = 4x = 4 * 20 = 80

Therefore, Jeff receives $80.

"To determine the total distance Jeff walks in a week, we must first calculate the daily distance he travels to and from work. Given that his workplace is 3 miles away, the round-trip distance is twice the one-way distance, which equals 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Since Jeff works 5 days a week, we can calculate the total weekly distance by multiplying the daily distance by the number of working days: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

Therefore, Jeff walks a total of 30 miles in a week."
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which yields 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is equivalent to 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Then, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is the sum of the letters from the first two steps: 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters she has written is the sum of the letters from the first two steps and the re-write: 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 letters.

The final answer is: 130"
"To determine the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we can analyze the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, 3 families are directly contacted by Ali. 
In the second round, each of the 3 families contacts 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified. 
In the third round, each of the 9 families contacts 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified. 
In the fourth round, each of the 27 families contacts 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families being notified.

However, it's essential to note that the total number of families notified in each round also includes the initial 3 families contacted by Ali. Therefore, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81 (new families) + 3 (initial families) = 84 families.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we must first calculate the total weight he lost during his illness. Since he lost 10 pounds per month for 3 consecutive months, the total weight lost can be calculated as follows:

Total weight lost = Weight lost per month * Number of months
Total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months
Total weight lost = 30 pounds

Now, we can find Mark's initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we must first establish the total number of toys in the larger play set. Given that James's play set contains 80 toys and the larger set is five times larger, we can calculate the total number of toys in the larger set by multiplying 80 by 5.

80 * 5 = 400

Now, we know that Jonathan requires 2 more toys than he currently has to possess 400 toys. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as ""x"". We can express this relationship as an equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: 398"
"To determine the total cost of the items Daniel wants to purchase, we first need to calculate the cost of each item individually.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50. 
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is 1 * $12 = $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is 1 * $10 = $10.

The total cost of all the items before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To find the discount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost. 
10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Daniel has to spend. 
$30 - $3 = $27.

The final answer is: $27"
"To determine the change Carly receives after purchasing the items, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items. 

The cost of five hamburgers at $4 each is 5 * $4 = $20. 
The cost of ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each is 10 * $0.30 = $3.
The cost of five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each is 5 * $2 = $10.

The total cost of the items is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17.

"To determine Antonella's earnings, we need to calculate her commission based on the sales amount. The commission structure is as follows: a 30% commission on the first $1000 in sales, and an additional 10% commission on sales exceeding $1000.

First, we calculate the commission for the initial $1000 in sales: 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

Next, we calculate the commission for the sales exceeding $1000: $2500 - $1000 = $1500. The additional commission for these sales is 10% of $1500, which equals 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

To find the total commission, we add the commission for the initial $1000 in sales and the additional commission for the sales exceeding $1000: $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella's total earnings are $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of bottles required for his party. Since he wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles needed for the guests is 70 * 2 = 140.

Bill initially has 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. Therefore, he already has a total of 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

To find the number of additional bottles needed, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles required: 140 (for guests) - 48 (he already has) = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to purchase 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: 92"
"To determine the time difference in swimming 3 miles between a cold day and a hot day, we first need to establish the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in each condition.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as the time it takes in cold water. Therefore, the time to swim a mile in warm water is 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes.

To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles in each condition, we multiply the time to swim a mile by 3. Thus, in cold water, it takes 3 * 16 = 48 minutes, and in warm water, it takes 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and 3 miles in cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we first need to calculate his weekly earnings. Given that he earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, his daily earnings can be calculated as follows:

Daily earnings = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked per day
= $2/hour * 5 hours/day
= $10/day

Since John works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings can be calculated as:

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days worked per week
= $10/day * 4 days/week
= $40/week

Now, we can determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80 by dividing the target savings by his weekly earnings:

Number of weeks = Target savings / Weekly earnings
= $80 / $40/week
= 2 weeks

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, which is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40. To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we multiply this by 3.

Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub: $40 * 3 = $120

The total cost for both subs is the sum of their individual costs.

Total cost = Cost of the foot-long fish sub + Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of holes in the bag of buttons, we must first identify the number of buttons with 2 holes and the number of buttons with 4 holes. Given that there are 7 buttons with 2 holes, we can calculate the number of buttons with 4 holes by subtracting this value from the total number of buttons, which is 21.

The number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

Now, we can calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes: 7 * 2 = 14.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes: 14 * 4 = 56.

To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we add the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

"To determine the amount by which Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we first need to establish the current amount he consumes. Given that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, we can express his current coffee intake as 10 times the amount Octavia drinks.

Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as x. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, her coffee intake is x/2. Consequently, Juan's coffee intake is 10 times that of Octavia, which is 10 * (x/2) = 5x.

We are informed that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. Therefore, x = 4. Substituting this value into the expression for Juan's coffee intake, we get 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

Given that Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we can calculate the reduction needed by subtracting the recommended intake from his current intake: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we must first calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately. 

The pet shop has 3 cages of hamsters, each containing 10 hamsters. Therefore, the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

Similarly, the pet shop has 3 cages of guinea pigs, each containing 5 guinea pigs. Thus, the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of rodents, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together: 30 + 15 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the average weight of the three friends, we must first calculate their individual weights and then find the total weight. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, which is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Bob's weight is twice that of Susan's, so it is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

The total weight of the three friends is the sum of their individual weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of individuals, which is 3. Therefore, the average weight is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

"To determine the final angle from the ground to the sun, we must consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the sun's movement. The sun is initially at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. As the sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour, we can calculate the total angle it covers in 10 hours.

The sun's movement can be calculated as follows:
Angle moved by the sun = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours
= 50 degrees

Now, we can find the final angle from the ground to the sun by adding the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle moved by the sun:
Final angle from the ground to the sun = Initial angle + Angle moved by the sun
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of candles James needs, we must first calculate the combined age of his two sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, which means the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

The total number of candles required is the sum of their ages, which is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of candles contains 5 candles and costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of candles required by the number of candles per pack: 20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles is then 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total minutes she reads in the first week is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she reads in 105 minutes by first finding the number of 1.5 minute intervals in 105 minutes. This is given by 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages Judy reads in 105 minutes by multiplying the number of 1.5 minute intervals by the number of pages she reads per 1.5 minutes, which is 2. Therefore, the total number of pages she reads in the first week is 2 * 70 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy reads a total of 100 pages.

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy reads in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which can be calculated as 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which can be calculated as 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches eaten is the sum of the sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor, which is 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches remaining, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.
This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.
This simplifies to x = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for each set of teeth and add them together.

For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left a fixed amount of $5.00.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left a constant amount of $1.00 each, resulting in a total of 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. Therefore, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we can establish a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. R = M + 20 (Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark)
2. R = A + 45 (Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna)
3. R = 80 (Richie scored 80 goals)

We can substitute the value of R from equation (3) into equations (1) and (2):

1. 80 = M + 20
   M = 80 - 20
   M = 60

2. 80 = A + 45
   A = 80 - 45
   A = 35

Now that we have the values of M and A, we can find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers:

Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Liam and Mitchell, we first need to calculate the total amount each individual earned from their respective lemonade sales.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so his total earnings can be calculated as the product of the number of lemonades sold and the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = $84.

Now, to find the difference in earnings between Mitchell and Liam, we subtract the amount Liam earned ($63) from Mitchell's earnings ($84): 84 - 63 = 21.

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam selling lemonade that weekend.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and add them up.

First, let's consider the wooden action figures. Peter spent $5 each day on these figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spent 4 days, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 * $5 = $20. Consequently, he purchased 20 / 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

Next, we need to calculate the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left. Since he has 5 days remaining (Thursday through Saturday) and each plastic action figure costs $2, the total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 50 / 2 = 25.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the total cost associated with the kitten, we must consider the expenses incurred. The initial cost of spaying the kitten is $200. Additionally, the kitten required 3 vaccinations, each costing $20, resulting in a total vaccination cost of 3 * $20 = $60. Furthermore, the kitten's mischievous behavior led to the breakage of 4 vases, each valued at $12, resulting in a total cost of 4 * $12 = $48.

To obtain the total cost, we sum the individual expenses: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccinations) + $48 (broken vases) = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we must first calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is the sum of the roses ordered by each shop: 20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the remaining balance in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount withdrawn from the account over this period.

Given that Katina removes $100 from her account every month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in 2 years is 2 * 12 = 24 months.

The total amount withdrawn from the account over 24 months is then 24 * $100 = $2400.

The initial balance in Katina's account is $3000. 

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial balance: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

Therefore, the remaining balance in Katina's account after 2 years is $600."
"To determine the net profit of the food truck, we must first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf yields 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich.

The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 for every 10 sandwiches. Consequently, the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese and condiments, which is $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30 per sandwich.

The total revenue is obtained by multiplying the number of sandwiches sold by the selling price per sandwich. In this case, the food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, resulting in a total revenue of 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00.

The net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. The total cost is the cost per sandwich multiplied by the number of sandwiches sold, which is $3.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00. Therefore, the net profit is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine the total amount of money Kate can make from selling her muffin crayons, we need to calculate the total number of muffin crayons she can produce and then multiply that by the price of each muffin crayon.

"To determine the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom, we must first calculate the area of the room. Given that the room measures 18 feet by 12 feet, the area can be calculated as the product of its length and width, which yields 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, resulting in a total cost of 216 * $12 = $2592. Additionally, the cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, totaling 216 * $2 = $432. The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, amounting to 216 * $4 = $864. Lastly, the cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, resulting in a total of 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of the materials is the sum of the carpet, padding, and removal costs, which equals $2592 + $432 + $864 = $3888. The total labor cost is the sum of the removal and installation costs, totaling $864 + $7344 = $8208.

Therefore, the total cost to replace the carpet is the sum of the material and labor costs, which is $3888 + $8208 = $12196.

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. This can be done by finding the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then dividing it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual and set temperatures is 468 - 450 = 18. 

Now, we can calculate the percentage by which the oven is off: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Given that the oven is off by 4%, to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to subtract 4% of 520 from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The temperature Maggie should set the oven to is 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature Maggie should set the oven to is 499.

"To determine the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we first need to establish the quantities of cups and dishes each of them brought.

Judy purchased a dozen cups, which is equivalent to 12 cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she acquired 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend, on the other hand, brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Therefore, her friend's dishes total 24 + 20 = 44.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Total Judy brought: 12 + 24 = 36

Next, we calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 
Friend's cups: 40
Friend's dishes: 44
Total friend brought: 40 + 44 = 84

To find the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend, we add the quantities together: 
Total Judy brought: 36
Total friend brought: 84
Total brought by both: 36 + 84 = 120

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to establish the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have. Given that 90 single-use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can calculate the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day as follows:

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete purchases 2 boxes, the total number of contacts he will have is:

2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

The total duration for which the contacts will last is:

180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the contacts with a 10% discount:

2 boxes * $100/box = $200
10% discount = $200 * 0.10 = $20
$200 - $20 = $180

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:

$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we first need to calculate their individual earnings. Jill worked a total of 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, resulting in a total of 3 hours of work. Given her hourly wage of $10, her total earnings can be calculated as 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John's work hours can be determined by considering that he worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday. This translates to 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday and 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday, for a total of 7 hours. With an hourly wage of $10, his total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories burned during her physical activities. 

Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour. Therefore, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories. 

Additionally, she spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour. Thus, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of the calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can determine the total amount of water she needs to drink by dividing the total calories burned by 200 and then multiplying the result by 100.

First, we divide the total calories burned by 200: 1600 / 200 = 8. 

Then, we multiply the result by 100 to find the total amount of water needed: 8 * 100 = 800.

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3.01B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3.01:
B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to calculate the mean of the three values. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, his typing speed increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, his new typing speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, let's add up all the measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over a period of 5 weeks.

The weight change due to eating Cheerios for breakfast is a loss of 1.25 pounds per week. Conversely, consuming donuts for breakfast results in a weight gain of 1.75 pounds per week.

To find the total weight change for each option, we multiply the weekly weight change by the number of weeks: 5.

Weight change due to eating Cheerios: -1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds
Weight change due to eating donuts: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options is the absolute value of the weight change due to eating donuts minus the weight change due to eating Cheerios: |8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds)| = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of seats Alex needs, we must consider the chain of invitations and the additional guests brought by her friends.

First, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these individuals will also invite 2 friends, resulting in a total of 100 + (100 * 2) = 300 additional guests. This brings the total number of people invited via email to 300.

Next, Alex extends invitations to 10 of her friends, and 8 of them indicate they will be bringing their spouses. This adds 18 more individuals to the total count.

Combining these groups, we have a total of 300 (email invitations) + 18 (Alex's friends and their spouses) = 318 people. However, this count does not account for Alex herself, so we must add 1 to the total.

Therefore, the total number of seats Alex needs is 318 + 1 = 319.

The final answer is: 319"
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we can establish a sequence of relationships between the weights of the four dogs. 

Let's start with the Affenpinscher, which weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund, being twice as heavy as the Affenpinscher, weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon, being one-fourth as heavy as the Dachshund, weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Finally, the Mastiff, which is 44 times heavier than the Papillon, weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To determine the difference in cost between purchasing the boots on Amazon and eBay, we first need to calculate the total cost of each option.

The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16, and the shipping cost is $4. Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. Thus, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of days it will take for the beanstalk to surpass Mark's second-story window, which is 20 feet off the ground, we can model the situation using exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles in height every day.

Let's denote the number of days as 'n'. The height of the beanstalk on the nth day can be represented as 4 * 2^(n-1), since it starts at 4 feet and doubles every day.

We want to find the smallest value of 'n' such that 4 * 2^(n-1) > 20. This can be rewritten as 2^(n-1) > 5.

To solve for 'n', we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of the inequality. This gives us n - 1 > log2(5), which simplifies to n > log2(5) + 1.

Using a calculator, we find that log2(5) is approximately 2.3219. Therefore, n > 2.3219 + 1, which is approximately 3.3219.

Since 'n' represents the number of days, it must be an integer. The smallest integer greater than 3.3219 is 4.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to surpass Mark's second-story window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of protein John consumes per week, we first need to establish the protein content per unit of mushroom weight. Given that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein percentage as follows:

Protein percentage = (Protein content / Weight) * 100
Protein percentage = (3 grams / 100 grams) * 100
Protein percentage = 3%

Now, we know that John consumes 200 grams of mushrooms daily. To find the daily protein intake, we can multiply the weight of mushrooms consumed by the protein percentage:

Daily protein intake = Weight of mushrooms consumed * Protein percentage
Daily protein intake = 200 grams * 0.03
Daily protein intake = 6 grams

To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7:

Weekly protein intake = Daily protein intake * 7
Weekly protein intake = 6 grams * 7
Weekly protein intake = 42 grams

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we must first calculate the total cost of the dental work and subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since George requires two implants, the total base price is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

Additionally, he wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which incurs an extra cost of $500. Therefore, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600. Consequently, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Given that George earns $15 per hour at work, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Given that one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
Given that one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

We can express the sum of the three angles as x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combining like terms, we get 6x = 180.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can determine the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Colby has, we need to calculate the value of his coins in cents. 

8 quarters contribute 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes contribute 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels contribute 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies contribute 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

The total value of his coins is the sum of these individual contributions: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can calculate the number of gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total value of his coins by the cost of one gumball.

Number of gumballs = Total value of coins / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we must first calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then sum these values.

Dogs have four legs each, so the total number of legs for the 5 dogs is 5 * 4 = 20.

Cats, being quadruped mammals, also have four legs each. With 2 cats in the store, the total number of legs for the cats is 2 * 4 = 8.

Birds, being bipedal, have two legs each. With 10 birds in the store, the total number of legs for the birds is 10 * 2 = 20.

Now, we can calculate the total number of legs in the store by summing the legs of the dogs, cats, and birds: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the initial 8-pound weight by 50%, we first calculate the 50% increase. This can be found by multiplying the initial weight by 0.5.

The 50% increase is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Adding this increase to the initial weight yields 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, Jamaal then uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than this. Therefore, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final weight Jamaal uses is 10 pounds.

"To determine the time it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to establish the plane's rate of travel. This can be calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

With the rate established, we can now calculate the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

"To determine the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in a 12-hour workday, we first need to establish their individual hourly production rates.

Ruiz's hourly production rate can be calculated by dividing his total production by the number of hours worked. Given that he produces 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, his hourly rate is 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa's hourly production rate is 3/4 times Ruiz's rate. Therefore, her hourly rate is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total production for each individual over a 12-hour period. Ruiz's total production is 60 * 12 = 720 pounds, while Marissa's total production is 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The combined total production for both Ruiz and Marissa over the 12-hour workday is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To determine the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from each period and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the revenue from the initial four hours. During this period, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup. The total number of cups sold in this period is given by the product of the hourly sales and the number of hours, which is 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups. Consequently, the total revenue from this period is 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the subsequent two hours. In this period, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup. The total number of cups sold in this period is 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups. Therefore, the total revenue from this period is 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

To find the total revenue from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we sum the revenues from the two periods, which yields $30 + $12 = $42.

"To determine the lifespan of the tires in years, we first need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires can undergo in a month. Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles per month, we can calculate the monthly rotations as follows:

Monthly rotations = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Next, we need to find the total number of months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. We are given that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. 

Total months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Total months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 290,000
Total months before replacement = 36

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = Total months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 36 / 12
Years before replacement = 3

"To determine the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract it from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price, which is $25. This can be calculated as follows:

Discount = 0.3 * $25 = $7.5

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt by subtracting the discount from the original price:

Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - $7.5 = $17.5

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the items. This is the sum of the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts:

Total cost = $17.5 + $35 = $52.5

Since the total cost is $52.5 and Joe has $50, we can calculate the amount of money he will have left after the purchase:

Amount left = $50 - $52.5 = -$2.5

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this indicates that Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.5"

"To determine the total amount Scarlett spent, we must calculate the cost of each item and sum them together.

First, we consider the cost of the aquarium, which was purchased for $10.00. 

Next, we calculate the cost of the rocks. Two bags of rocks at $2.50 each will be 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.

The cost of the coral is then calculated as 3 pieces at $2.00 each, which equals 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The cost of the fish is determined by multiplying the number of fish by the cost per fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each will be 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.

Lastly, we consider the cost of the fish food, which was $2.00.

Now, we sum the costs of all the items: $10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00.

"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we first calculate the total number of seats available. Given that there are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row, the total number of seats is:

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we find the number of seats occupied by the administrators, which is one-fourth of the total seats.

Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are then calculated by subtracting the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Now, we find the number of seats occupied by the parents, which is one-third of the remaining seats.

Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Finally, we determine the number of students by subtracting the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.

Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we must first calculate the total number of street lights and then subtract the number of non-functioning lights.

Given that each pole at a road intersection has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, the total number of poles is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each pole has 4 street lights, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

However, it is stated that 20 street lights are not functioning. Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining number of plays for each DVD and then sum those values.

DVD 1 has been played 356 times and can be played a maximum of 1000 times. Therefore, the remaining number of plays for DVD 1 is 1000 - 356 = 644.

Similarly, DVD 2 has been played 135 times and can be played a maximum of 1000 times. Thus, the remaining number of plays for DVD 2 is 1000 - 135 = 865.

The total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is the sum of their remaining plays: 644 + 865 = 1509.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1509}$"
"To determine the total cost of John's physical therapy, we must first calculate the total number of hours he attended physical therapy. Given that he attended therapy for 6 weeks, twice a week, for 2 hours at a time, we can calculate the total number of sessions and hours as follows:

Total number of sessions = 6 weeks * 2 sessions/week = 12 sessions
Total hours = 12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours

Next, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total hours by the cost per hour, which is $125.

Total cost = Total hours * Cost per hour = 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000.

The final answer is: $3000"
"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

First, we calculate the number of pieces he chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, we divide the total school hours by 2 to find the number of pieces he chews at school: 8 hours / 2 = 4 pieces.

In addition to the pieces he chews at school, Jim also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. Therefore, the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day is 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces.

Initially, Jim has 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

However, Jim's sister asks for half of the remaining gum before bed. To find out how many pieces she takes, we divide the remaining gum by 2: 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

Finally, we subtract the number of pieces his sister takes from the remaining gum: 14 - 7 = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we first need to establish her current age. Given that she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 12 from 16.

16 - 12 = 4

This indicates that Charmaine is currently 4 years old. To find her age 4 years from now, we add 4 to her current age.

4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the difference in the amount spent by the two sports coaches, we first calculate the total expenditure for each coach. The baseball coach purchased 9 baseballs at $3 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 9 * $3 = $27. 

The basketball coach, on the other hand, bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, leading to a total expenditure of 8 * $14 = $112.

To find the difference in their expenditures, we subtract the baseball coach's expenditure from the basketball coach's expenditure: $112 - $27 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden, we first calculate the total number of flowers. Given that there are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers is the product of these two quantities.

The total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can find the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by 4/5.

4/5 * 200 = (4 * 200) / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160

Therefore, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we first need to convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s. Since 1 Mb is equivalent to 1000 kb, we can perform this conversion by dividing her speed in kb/s by 1000.

Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb/s. To convert this to Mb/s, we calculate:
20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Next, we need to convert her speed from Mb/s to Mb/hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply her speed in Mb/s by 3600:
0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h.

The final answer is: 72"
"To determine the total number of cars towed by the truck during the week, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

The number of cars towed on the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30.

The number of cars towed on the remaining days is 7 - 3 = 4 days. Since 4 fewer cars were towed on each of these days, the number of cars towed on each of these days is 10 - 4 = 6. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 6 * 4 = 24.

The total number of cars towed that week is 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to reach the required height to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and his current height, and then divide that by his annual growth rate.

First, we convert the required height from feet to inches, as Adam's height is given in inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the required height is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Adam's current height is 40 inches, and he grows 2 inches per year. To find the number of years it will take for him to reach the required height, we subtract his current height from the required height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Now, we divide the difference in height by his annual growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the required height to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine James' earnings from selling the used cars, we must first calculate the profit from the sale of the vehicles. 

The total cost of the cars is $250,000, as each car costs $25,000 and James sold 10 cars. The company's cost to acquire the cars is 30% of the total cost, which is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000. 

The profit from selling the cars is then calculated as the total cost minus the company's cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James earns a 10% commission on the profit, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we can calculate this as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we can calculate this as follows:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

Now, to find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total price for all three jewels, we need to establish the prices of the gold and silver jewels relative to the diamond jewel.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can express the price of the gold jewel as a multiple of the diamond jewel's price. Specifically, the price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel. This relationship can be represented as:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Next, we are informed that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. This can be expressed as:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

With the prices of the gold and silver jewels determined, we can now calculate the total price for all three jewels by summing their individual prices:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of truck and rose stamps in addition to the snowflake stamps.

Max purchased 16 snowflake stamps. Since he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19. 

Furthermore, he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

To find the total number of stamps, we sum the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the relative speed between the two individuals and the distance separating them.

The relative speed is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph. This represents the rate at which Tom is closing the gap between them.

Given that the distance between them is 75 miles, we can calculate the time it will take for Tom to catch up using the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed

Substituting the given values, we get:

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of fish caught by Tommy, Darren, and Naomi. We are given that Naomi caught 17 fish. Since Darren caught 6 fewer fish than Naomi, we can express this as:

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now, we are also given that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Therefore, we can express this as:

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes attended at $6 per class as x and the number of classes attended at $10 per class as y. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

The equation representing this situation is 6x + 10y = 60.

Since we want to find the maximum number of classes Manny can attend at $6 per class, we can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

We can rewrite the equation as 6x = 60 - 10y.

Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 10 - (5/3)y.

Since x must be a whole number, 10 - (5/3)y must also be a whole number. This implies that (5/3)y must be an integer.

Let's try different values of y to find the maximum number of classes Manny can attend at $6 per class.

If y = 3, (5/3)y = 5, which is an integer.

If y = 4, (5/3)y = 20/3, which is not an integer.

Since y = 3 is the largest value that satisfies the condition, we can substitute it back into the equation x = 10 - (5/3)y to find the corresponding value of x.

x = 10 - (5/3)(3)
x = 10 - 5
x = 5

Therefore, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to calculate their individual daily and weekly production rates.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Given that there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, her daily production rate is 50 * 2 = 100 customers. Consequently, Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To determine the distance Lynn ran, we first need to establish the distance Reggie ran. Given that Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles, Reggie's distance can be calculated as 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

Since Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, we can express Lynn's distance as Reggie's distance minus 3 miles. Therefore, Lynn's distance is 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to establish the cost per unit for each fruit. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost per apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. Therefore, the cost of 5 apples is 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.

Similarly, the cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost per orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10. Consequently, the cost of 5 oranges is 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole, is given by the product of its length, width, and depth.

Given that the dimensions of the hole are 6 feet in length, 4 feet in width, and 3 feet in depth, we can calculate the volume as follows:

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can find the total time it will take him to dig the hole by multiplying the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: $\boxed{216}$"
"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we must first calculate the cost of each additional feature and then add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The cost of the leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so their cost is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's calculate the total cost by adding the base price and the costs of the additional features:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To determine Tim's total annual income, we must first calculate his new monthly salary after the 5% raise. This can be done by multiplying his original monthly salary by the raise percentage.

Original monthly salary: $20,000
Raise percentage: 5% or 0.05
New monthly salary = $20,000 + (0.05 * $20,000) = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, we calculate the bonus, which is half of his original monthly salary.
Bonus = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, we can determine his total monthly income by adding the new monthly salary and the bonus.
Total monthly income = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, we calculate his total annual income by multiplying his total monthly income by 12.
Total annual income = $31,000 * 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To determine the total cost of James' purchases, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 10 suits at $750 each amounts to 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, we calculate the cost of the dress pants. Given that they cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit, we can express this as (1/5) * $750 = $150 per dress pant. Therefore, 10 dress pants will cost 10 * $150 = $1500.

Moving on to the dress shirts, James buys 3 shirts per suit, and since he bought 10 suits, he purchased a total of 10 * 3 = 30 shirts. At $60 per shirt, the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

Now, we can sum up the costs of all the items: $7500 (suits) + $1500 (dress pants) + $1800 (dress shirts) = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"
"To determine the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we first need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website. The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. Therefore, the total number of articles published by the news website is 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles.

Similarly, the sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day. Thus, the total number of articles published by the sister company is 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles.

Now, we can find the total number of articles published by both websites by adding the total number of articles published by each website: 560 articles (news website) + 280 articles (sister company) = 840 articles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{840}$"
"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we can break down the information provided.

First, we know that Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, and since Steve is 60 years old, his wife's age is 60 + 4 = 64 years.

Next, we are told that their son is half as old as his mother, which means his age is 64 / 2 = 32 years.

Finally, we are informed that Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is 32 - 3 = 29 years.

Therefore, the age of Steve's son's wife is 29 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to calculate the total amount of flour in one bag and then multiply it by 3.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can find the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion: 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we can find the total amount of flour in three bags by multiplying the amount of flour in one bag by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

"To determine the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we first calculate the distance each individual covered. Alisa's speed was 12 miles per hour, and she biked for 4.5 hours. Using the formula distance = speed * time, we find that Alisa biked 12 * 4.5 = 54 miles.

Similarly, Stanley biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Using the same formula, we find that Stanley biked 10 * 2.5 = 25 miles.

To find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we add their individual distances: 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

The rate at which Bill can dig through soil is 4 feet per hour. Therefore, the time it takes to dig through 24 feet of soil is 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

The rate at which Bill can dig through clay is half that of soil, which is 2 feet per hour. Consequently, the time it takes to dig through 8 feet of clay is 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

The total time to dig the well is the sum of the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, which is 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"To determine the total number of likes on Fishio's Instagram post, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo. Three weeks later, the number of likes increased to 70 times the initial number of likes. This can be expressed as 70 * 2000 = 140000 likes.

However, we are not given the number of likes received in the three-week period. Instead, we are informed that 20000 new likes were received recently. To find the total number of likes after this recent increase, we need to determine the number of likes after the three-week period and then add the 20000 new likes.

The number of likes after the three-week period is 140000. To find the number of likes received in the three-week period, we subtract the initial number of likes from this total: 140000 - 2000 = 138000.

Now, we can calculate the total number of likes by adding the 20000 new likes to the number of likes after the three-week period: 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160000}$"
"To determine the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two costs.

On the first day, Clara purchased 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she received a $2 discount due to a voucher. The total cost is calculated as follows:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate increased to $30, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is:
20 * $30 = $600
The discount is 10% of $600, which is:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
So, the total cost with the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$540 - $398 = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"To determine the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to calculate her sales for each month and then sum them.

Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as x. Since her sales from red hats in the first month were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can express this as x/2 = $400. Multiplying both sides by 2 yields x = $800.

Thus, in the first month, Ariadne's total sales from green hats were $800 and from red hats were $400. Consequently, her total sales in the first month were $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales in the second month are 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we can calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received.

Sally's expected wage for the week is $300. To find the total amount she should have in her account, we add this to the initial amount of $200.

Expected total = Initial amount + Expected wage
Expected total = $200 + $300
Expected total = $500

Since Sally actually has $420 in her account, we can find the amount withheld by subtracting the actual amount from the expected total.

Amount withheld = Expected total - Actual amount
Amount withheld = $500 - $420
Amount withheld = $80

Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally's wage is $80."
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs for her party, we must first calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Given that each guest will consume 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, we can find the total number of deviled egg halves by multiplying the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves per guest.

Total deviled egg halves = 16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves/guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since each whole egg yields 2 deviled egg halves, we can find the total number of eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

Total eggs = 48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves/egg = 24 eggs

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we divide by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen.

Total dozens of eggs = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens

Therefore, Lori needs 2 dozens of eggs for her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

Given that the total number of pages in the paper is 15, we can calculate the number of pages left to write by multiplying the fraction of the paper remaining by the total number of pages:

Pages left to write = (2/3) * 15
Pages left to write = 2 * 5
Pages left to write = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of days before the deadline that Mike will finish his reading, we can calculate the time it will take him to complete the book and then subtract that from the total number of days allotted.

The total number of pages in the book is 200, and Mike plans to read 10 pages per day. 

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can now calculate the number of days before the deadline that he will finish his reading.

Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish the book
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To determine the total cost of acquiring and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, the annual hanger rental, and the annual fuel expenses.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly hanger rental is $5,000. To find the annual hanger rental cost, we multiply this by 12, yielding $60,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $10,000. Therefore, the annual fuel cost is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we sum the initial purchase price, the annual hanger rental, and the annual fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To determine the total cooking time for Finley's meal, we must first establish the individual cooking times for each component. 

Let's denote the cooking time for rice as R, pork as P, and beans as B. We are given that R = 30 minutes. Additionally, we know that P = R + 20, which implies P = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Furthermore, we are informed that B = (R + P) / 2, which is equivalent to B = (30 + 50) / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time, we sum the individual cooking times: R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost difference between two mixtures, we first need to calculate the total cost of each mixture. 

For the first mixture, consisting of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we can calculate the cost as follows:
- The cost of almonds is (1/2) * $10 = $5.
- The cost of walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture, consisting of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we can calculate the cost as follows:
- The cost of almonds is (1/5) * $10 = $2.
- The cost of walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we can find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
Difference = $10 - $7
Difference = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

We know that the total number of animal legs is 70, and since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can write the equation 4S + 2G = 70.

Additionally, we are given that the total number of animal heads is 20, and since each sheep and each goose has one head, we can write the equation S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G by subtracting S from both sides, yielding G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. However, the more expensive brand, which he opted for due to the unavailability of his favorite brand, costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 20% of $5, which is 0.2 * $5 = $1. Therefore, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he requires 7 pounds of coffee for a week. Consequently, the cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

In addition to the coffee, Roger also purchased a donut for $2.

Therefore, the total cost of Roger's purchase is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we must first calculate the total expenditure on the items Gus purchased. The cost of the two bags of chips is $2.00 each, which amounts to 2 * $2.00 = $4.00. Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken, which is $8.00, yields a subtotal of $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00. Finally, the cost of the bottle of soda is $1.00, bringing the total to $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, to find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total expenditure on the items from the initial $20.00 spent by Gus: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The cost of the apple pie is $7.00."
"To determine the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we can utilize a simple arithmetic operation. Given that James delivers a total of 600 newspapers in a day, with 198 newspapers going to District A and 209 newspapers going to District C, we can calculate the number of newspapers delivered to District B by subtracting the sum of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total.

Let's proceed with the calculation:

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

Therefore, the number of newspapers delivered to District B is 193."
"To determine the number of recipes John learns in the cooking class, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours. Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

Given that John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, we can calculate the total number of recipes he learns by dividing the total class time by the time it takes to learn a new recipe: 48 / 1.5 = 32.

Therefore, the total number of recipes John learns in the cooking class is 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the collective sleeping time of the math teachers, we first need to calculate the number of math teachers on the court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can find the number of history teachers as follows:

Number of history teachers = 0.6 * 150
= 90

Now, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

Total time = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
= 60 * 6
= 360

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the amount of money each individual would have if they decided to add their funds together and share them equally, we must first establish the amount of money each person possesses.

Aurelia's financial holdings are given as $120. Given that Kassidy's funds are 3/4 of Aurelia's, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna's financial holdings are 60 dollars more than Kassidy's, which can be calculated as 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

To find the total amount of money, we sum the individual holdings: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

Finally, to determine the amount each person would have if they shared their funds equally, we divide the total by 3: 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

Therefore, each person would have $120."
"To determine the total duration of the basketball game, we must first calculate the length of the regular four quarters. Each quarter is 12 minutes long, so the total duration of the regular quarters is 4 * 12 = 48 minutes.

Since the game was extended by five minutes due to a tie in the last quarter, we must add this additional time to the total duration of the regular quarters. Therefore, the total duration of the game is 48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

The final answer is: 53"
"To determine the number of employees who oversee the company, we first need to calculate the number of management employees, which is 20% of the total workforce of 50.

20% of 50 can be calculated as 0.2 * 50 = 10. This means there are 10 management employees in the company.

Next, we need to find 30% of the management employees, as only 30% of the management oversee the entire company.

30% of 10 can be calculated as 0.3 * 10 = 3.

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients required for 16 muffins, we must first calculate the individual amounts of flour, sugar, and salt needed.

The amount of flour required for 16 muffins is calculated as 16 * 5 = 80 tablespoons.

Similarly, the amount of sugar needed is 16 * 3 = 48 tablespoons.

Lastly, the amount of salt required is 16 * 0.25 = 4 tablespoons.

To obtain the total amount of dry ingredients, we sum the individual amounts: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To determine the amount of candy each individual would have after sharing, we must first calculate the total amount of candy available. This can be achieved by summing the individual quantities of candy possessed by Robert, Cindy, and Aaron.

Robert has 3 pounds of candy, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. Therefore, the total amount of candy is the sum of these quantities:

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4
Total candy = 12 pounds

Since the candy is to be shared equally among the three individuals, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of people:

12 / 3 = 4

Each person would have 4 pounds of candy after sharing."
"To determine the change Adam received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the candies he purchased. The cost of type A candies is calculated as the product of the number of candies and the cost per candy, which is 7 * $0.5 = $3.5. Similarly, the cost of type B candies is 10 * $0.75 = $7.5. The total cost of the candies is the sum of these two values, which is $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.

Given that Adam paid the cashier $15, the change he received is the difference between the amount paid and the total cost of the candies, which is $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to analyze Christina's mood pattern. The first 8 days were good, followed by 8 bad days, and then 8 neutral days. This accounts for 24 days. 

The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, which adds 3 more good days to the total. However, we are given that Christina had 12 good days in total. Since we have already accounted for 10 good days (8 initial good days and 2 additional good days from the last 3 days), we can calculate the remaining good days as follows:

Total good days = 12
Good days accounted for = 10
Remaining good days = Total good days - Good days accounted for
Remaining good days = 12 - 10
Remaining good days = 2

Therefore, there are 2 good days left in the month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of books Sally has, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This relationship can be expressed as:

Janey's books = 2x + 3

Given that Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of days required for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches, we first need to establish the current height in inches. Given that there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the initial height of 20 feet to inches as follows:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Next, we calculate the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we can determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches, given its growth rate of 30 inches per day:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take the bamboo 12 days to reach a height of 600 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we must consider the changing number of dogs in the shelter and the corresponding increase in toy requirements.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, indicating that each dog has 1 toy. With 8 additional dogs in the shelter, James requires 8 more toys to meet the demand. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12.

Upon his return, the number of dogs in the shelter doubles, resulting in 16 additional dogs. Consequently, James must acquire 16 more toys to meet the increased demand. The total number of toys needed now is 12 (initial toys) + 16 (additional toys) = 28.

However, when James returns again, 3 dogs are no longer in the shelter, rendering 3 toys unnecessary. Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 28 (total toys needed so far) - 3 (toys no longer required) = 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the amount invested by Skyler, we first need to calculate the amount invested by Dylan and then the amount invested by Frances.

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount invested, which is $1200. This can be calculated as follows:

(2/5) * 1200 = 480

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is $1200 - $480 = $720.

Next, we calculate Frances' investment, which is 2/3 of the remaining amount:

(2/3) * 720 = 480

The remaining amount after Frances' investment is $720 - $480 = $240.

Therefore, Skyler's investment is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal, we first calculate the total number of signatures they have collected so far. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

The sisters aim to collect a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the total signatures they have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we can calculate the number of signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal.

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of 100 signatures.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine Karen's earnings in two days, we first need to establish her hourly wage. Given that she earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is 2 * $10 = $20.

Next, we calculate the total hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, her total hours worked in two days is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate Karen's total earnings by multiplying her hourly wage by the total hours worked: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can establish a ratio of potatoes to hash browns based on the given information that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns. This ratio can be expressed as a fraction: 6/36.

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6. This yields a simplified ratio of 1/6.

Now, we can use this ratio to find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes. We set up a proportion: 1/6 = 96/x, where x represents the unknown number of hash browns.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 1*x = 6*96. This simplifies to x = 576.

Therefore, 96 potatoes can be used to make 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: $\boxed{576}$"
"To determine the extent to which the maximum load of the elevator is exceeded, we must first calculate the total weight of the 9 adults. This can be achieved by multiplying the average weight of an adult by the number of adults.

The average weight of an adult is 80 kg, and there are 9 adults in the elevator. Therefore, the total weight of the 9 adults is:

Total weight = 80 kg * 9
Total weight = 720 kg

Given that the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we can now calculate the excess weight by subtracting the maximum load from the total weight of the 9 adults.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of cookies, we need to establish the number of cookies each individual possesses.

Let's begin by identifying the number of cookies Katarina has, which is given as 68. 

Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina, so we can express this as Max = Katarina + 5. Substituting the value of Katarina's cookies, we get Max = 68 + 5 = 73.

The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, which can be represented as Cookie Monster = Max - 12. Substituting the value of Max's cookies, we get Cookie Monster = 73 - 12 = 61.

Lastly, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so we can express this as Summer = Max + 23. Substituting the value of Max's cookies, we get Summer = 73 + 23 = 96.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies by summing the cookies of each individual: Katarina + Max + Cookie Monster + Summer = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96.

The total number of cookies is 298.

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To determine the original length of the dress, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, which is equivalent to 0.5x. Additionally, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the total length of the extended dress is x + 0.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length of the dress is 140cm. So, we can set up the equation: x + 0.5x + 20 = 140.

Combining like terms, we get 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation yields 1.5x = 120.

Dividing both sides by 1.5, we find x = 80.

Therefore, the original length of the dress is 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we must first establish the time it took for each mode of operation. The time in turtle mode is 60 minutes, as it takes 1 hour to complete the lawn. Conversely, the time in rabbit mode is 40 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we can calculate the time for each mode by multiplying the respective time by 0.5 (half). This yields 30 minutes for the turtle mode and 20 minutes for the rabbit mode.

To obtain the total time, we add the time for both modes together. Therefore, the total time is 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the remaining time for John and Jack to arrive at school without being late, we need to calculate the time elapsed in reaching the fire station and then subtract this from the total time available.

The time taken to reach the fire station is the sum of the time taken to get to the corner where the library is and the time taken to get to the fire station itself. 

Time taken to get to the fire station = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Now, we subtract this from the total time available to find the remaining time.

Remaining time = Total time available - Time taken to get to the fire station
Remaining time = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Remaining time = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to get to school without being late.

The final answer is: 11"

"To determine the number of cookies in the box, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. Greta bakes 30 cookies, while Celinda bakes twice as many, which is 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies is the sum of Greta's and Celinda's cookies, which is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

After consuming 10 cookies, the remaining number of cookies in the box can be calculated by subtracting the consumed cookies from the total, yielding 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

We have two equations:

1. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, we need to find the age of one of the twins. Given that the older twin is 7 years older than the triplet, we can calculate the age of the older twin as follows:

The age of the older twin = T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is 19.33.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"
"To determine the time John has available for a nap, we must first calculate the total time he has before dinner. Since John has 3 hours before dinner, we convert this to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time John spends on homework. He has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. The total time spent on homework is the sum of these individual times: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find the time available for a nap: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap."
"To determine the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to establish the cost of a single candy. Given that the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20, and the cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00, the cost of 4 candies can be calculated as $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

Consequently, the cost of a single candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30. 

Now, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is equivalent to 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Next, we calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"To determine the amount John leaves with after visiting the vet, we need to calculate the total cost of the services provided. The cost of the vaccines is $20 per vaccine, and since there are two vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. The heartworm check can be expressed as 0.6x. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To isolate 'x', we subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation: 0.4x = $40.

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for 'x': x = $100.

The total bill is $100, and the heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of its individual components. 

First, let's establish the cost of each fruit. Given that one apple costs $0.5, we can infer that one banana costs twice as much, which is 2 * $0.5 = $1. Furthermore, since oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we must first calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them together.

The comforter contains 14 red squares. The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares, which is 14 + 4 = 18. The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares, resulting in 18 + 6 = 24. Lastly, the number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares, which equals 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we sum the number of squares of each color to find the total: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.

Therefore, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of chairs Mia's restaurant needs to obtain, we must first calculate the total number of chairs required for the attendees. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies, resulting in a total of 57 individuals.

Given that the restaurant has 8 high chairs, and there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
= 5 * 8
= 40

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs available in the restaurant:

Total number of chairs available = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
= 8 + 40
= 48

To find the number of additional chairs needed, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs required:

Number of chairs needed to be added = Total number of chairs required - Total number of chairs available

"To determine the number of 8-point bucks in the field, we first need to calculate the total number of bucks present. Given that 50 percent of the deer are bucks, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 50 by 100, which equals 0.5. Multiplying this decimal by the total number of deer (50) yields the number of bucks: 0.5 * 50 = 25.

Next, we need to find 20 percent of the bucks that are 8 points. This can be calculated by converting the percentage to a decimal by dividing 20 by 100, resulting in 0.2. Multiplying this decimal by the number of bucks (25) gives us the number of 8-point bucks: 0.2 * 25 = 5.

Therefore, the number of 8-point bucks in the field is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total points collected by the class, we need to calculate the points earned by each student. 

Adam has collected 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 0.3 by 50, which equals 15. Therefore, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Subtracting 30 from Betty's total, we get 65 - 30 = 35 points for Tom.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. Multiplying Tom's total by 3, we get 3 * 35 = 105 points for Martha.

The total points collected by the class is the sum of the points earned by each student: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

To find out how many points the class is missing to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{145}$"
"To determine the total number of great grand-babies at the family reunion, we can apply a simple multiplication principle. Great Grandma Jones has three children, each of whom has three children of their own. This results in a total of 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren.

Next, each of these grandchildren has three babies, which are the great grand-babies in question. Therefore, we multiply the number of grandchildren by the number of great grand-babies per grandchild, yielding 9 x 3 = 27.

Thus, there will be 27 great grand-babies at the family reunion for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the amount Greta has left to spend after funding her retirement account and making her car payment, we must first calculate the respective amounts allocated for these purposes.

The amount allocated for her retirement account is 50% of her paycheck, which is equivalent to 0.5 multiplied by $2400.00. This yields $1200.00.

Next, we calculate the amount used for her car payment, which is 20% of her paycheck, or 0.2 multiplied by $2400.00, resulting in $480.00.

To find the remaining amount, we subtract the sum of these allocations from her initial paycheck: $2400.00 - ($1200.00 + $480.00) = $2400.00 - $1680.00 = $720.00.

Therefore, Greta has $720.00 left to spend."
"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to calculate the number of pencils that are currently in the box. Given that the box has a capacity for 20 pencils and 4 pencils are missing, we can find the current number of pencils by subtracting the missing pencils from the total capacity.

Number of pencils in the box = Total capacity of the box - Pencils missing
= 20 - 4
= 16

Since a pair consists of 2 pencils, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the total number of pencils by 2.

Number of pairs of pencils = Number of pencils in the box / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we must first calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and her backyard display separately.

The city display consists of 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. Therefore, the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

However, Hannah can only see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find this value, we calculate 40% of 300 as 0.4 * 300 = 120.

In addition to the city display, Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. This results in a total of 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks from her backyard display.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display: 120 + 15 = 135.

"To determine the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks purchased and then multiply it by the cost per item.

First, we calculate the total number of people: Aiden and his 12 friends, plus 7 more friends, equals 19 people.

Since each seat can accommodate one person, two drinks, and three snacks, the total number of drinks and snacks purchased is 19 * 2 (drinks) + 19 * 3 (snacks) = 38 drinks + 57 snacks = 95 items.

The cost per item is $2. Therefore, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 95 items * $2 = $190.

The final answer is: $190"
"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we can start by identifying the individual capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks. Given that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel, and Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

Gordy's truck capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + 800 pounds
= 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds
= 4,800 pounds

Now, we know that the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. To find the capacity of Gary's truck, we can subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = 4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds
= 8,800 pounds

Capacity of Gary's truck = Total capacity - Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks
= 11,600 pounds - 8,800 pounds
= 2,800 pounds

Therefore, the capacity of Gary's truck is 2,800 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2800}$"
"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can start by calculating the total number of dumplings consumed by the group. 

Let's denote the number of dumplings each female ate as 'f' and the number of dumplings each male ate as 'm'. We are given that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so we can express this as m = f + 1.

We are also given that each female ate 3 dumplings, so f = 3. Substituting this into the equation m = f + 1, we get m = 3 + 1 = 4.

Now, we can calculate the total number of dumplings consumed by the females, which is 6 * f = 6 * 3 = 18. Similarly, the total number of dumplings consumed by the males is 8 * m = 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings consumed by the group is the sum of the dumplings consumed by the females and the males, which is 18 + 32 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings consumed, which is 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the initial amount of money Gerald had. Given that the ratio of Gerald's share to Julia's share is 3:2, we can calculate the total parts in the ratio as 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying 100 by 3/5.

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * 100 = 60

After spending $10 on a book, Gerald is left with:

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10 = 50

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to establish the turtle's speed. Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can calculate the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5
The turtle's speed = 3 feet/second

Now, we can calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we must first calculate the amount they need to raise per hour. Given that they have raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, we can find the hourly rate by dividing the total amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Next, we need to calculate the remaining amount they need to raise to reach their goal of $6300. This can be found by subtracting the amount already raised from the total goal: $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Now, we can determine the number of hours required to raise the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by the hourly rate: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they have already fundraised for 3 hours, we must add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours to find the total number of hours needed: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we first need to calculate the percentage of water used by the city and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

Given that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River, and 80% of this water is utilized for industrial purposes, we can calculate the percentage used for industrial purposes as follows:

Percentage used for industrial purposes = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city:

Percentage used for non-industrial purposes = 40% - 32% = 8%

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"

Therefore, the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring is $168.

The final answer is: $168"
"To determine the total quarts of ice cream produced in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then sum them together.

First, we calculate the production rate of chocolate ice cream. Given that the factory produces 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, the production rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

Next, we calculate the production rate of vanilla ice cream. Since the factory produces 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours, the production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total quarts of each type of ice cream produced in 48 hours. For chocolate ice cream, this is 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts. For vanilla ice cream, this is 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts.

Therefore, the total quarts of ice cream produced in 48 hours is 2400 + 600 = 3000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To determine Marcus' total bill, we must first calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

The cost of the croissants is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00. The cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00. The cost of the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. Lastly, the cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost before the discount is the sum of these individual costs: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

To calculate the discount, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage: 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is the original total cost minus the discount: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should purchase, we must first consider the cost-effectiveness of the deal offered by the ice cream parlor. The deal stipulates that for every 3 scoops purchased, Erin will receive 1 free, effectively reducing the cost to $4.50 for 3 scoops.

Given Erin's budget of $6.00, we can calculate the maximum number of scoops she can purchase by dividing her budget by the cost per 3-scoop set. 

$6.00 / $4.50 = 1.3333 (round down to 1, since Erin cannot purchase a fraction of a set)

Since Erin can purchase 1 set of 3 scoops for $4.50, she can buy 1 set and have $1.50 remaining. With this remaining amount, she can purchase an additional scoop for $1.50.

Therefore, Erin should purchase 4 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the difference in the amount of candy Amy and Ginger have after two weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of candies each consumes during this period.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day, and Amy eats 3 pieces per day. Over a two-week period (14 days), Ginger's total consumption is 4 * 14 = 56 pieces, while Amy's total consumption is 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Now, we calculate the remaining candies for each individual. Ginger starts with 100 pieces and consumes 56, leaving her with 100 - 56 = 44 pieces. Similarly, Amy starts with 100 pieces and consumes 42, resulting in 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

To find the difference in the amount of candy Amy and Ginger have, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To determine the total number of mosaic tiles required, we first need to calculate the area that Mr. Boarden needs to cover, which is two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The area can be calculated as (2/3) * 36. To simplify this, we multiply 2 by 36 and then divide by 3. This yields (2 * 36) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24 sq ft.

Now, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 sq ft, he would need 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"To determine the amount James saved by picking blueberries, we must first calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and the total cost of purchasing them at the store.

The cost of picking blueberries is comprised of an initial fee of $20 and an additional $1.5 per pound. Given that James picked 30 pounds of blueberries, the total cost of picking is $20 + (1.5 * 30) = $20 + $45 = $65.

On the other hand, the cost of purchasing blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound. Therefore, the total cost of purchasing 30 pounds of blueberries at the store is 2.5 * 30 = $75.

To find the amount James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of purchasing at the store: $75 - $65 = $10.

"To determine the number of people who accept the position, we can apply the given percentages step by step.

First, we calculate the number of people who receive interviews. Given that 30% of the applicants receive interviews, we can express this as a decimal and multiply it by the total number of applicants (100).

30% = 0.3
Number of people who receive interviews = 0.3 * 100 = 30

Next, we find the number of people who receive a job offer. This is 20% of those who received interviews, which we can also express as a decimal and multiply by the number of people who received interviews.

20% = 0.2
Number of people who receive a job offer = 0.2 * 30 = 6

Finally, we calculate the number of people who accept the position. This is one-third of those who received a job offer, which we can express as a fraction and divide by the number of people who received a job offer.

1/3 = 6 / 3 = 2

Therefore, the number of people who accept the position is 2.

"To determine the total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the total number of taps for two distinct scenarios: when her arms are down and when her arms are up.

When her arms are down, Helga taps her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute and her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute. Therefore, the total number of taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550. Since she dances for 3 minutes with her arms down, the total number of taps in this scenario is 550 * 3 = 1650.

When her arms are up, Helga taps her right foot at a rate of 200 taps per minute and her left foot at a rate of 200 taps per minute. Consequently, the total number of taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400. Since she dances for 2 minutes with her arms up, the total number of taps in this scenario is 400 * 2 = 800.

To find the combined total number of taps, we add the total number of taps from both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we must first calculate the total cost associated with repairing the pothole. This includes the fine for unauthorized road maintenance, which is $120, and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, each priced at $25. The total cost of asphalt is therefore 3 * $25 = $75.

The total cost of fixing the pothole is the sum of the fine and the cost of asphalt, which is $120 + $75 = $195.

Next, we need to compare this cost to the potential damage the pothole will cause to Ron's car, which is $450. By subtracting the cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage, we can determine the amount of money Ron saves by taking action.

The calculation is as follows: $450 - $195 = $255.

The restaurant initially had 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs, totaling 193 chairs. 

The number of chairs sent for repair consists of 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs, which amounts to 33 chairs.

To find the remaining number of chairs, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the initial total:

193 (initial chairs) - 33 (chairs sent for repair) = 160

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two of his friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they consumed as follows:

Let's denote the total number of slices as S. Since there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends), and each person gets a pizza with 12 slices, the total number of slices is S = 5 * 12 = 60.

The number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends is 2/3 of the total number of slices, which is (2/3) * 60 = 40 slices.

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

40 slices - 24 slices = 16 slices

Now, we know that 2 friends ate Â¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

Total number of slices = 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices
Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 16 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we first need to calculate the time taken by the dog. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can find the dog's time by multiplying the cat's time by 2/3.

Given that the cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes, the time taken by the dog is (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

Now, we can find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog by taking the mean of their respective times. The average time is given by the formula:

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2

Substituting the values, we get:

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

Therefore, the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can calculate the length of Topher's shoe as follows:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Adding 4 inches to this result yields a total length of 100 inches for one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we can express the relationship between the length of Topher's shoe and Bobby's shoe as an equation. Let 'x' represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes. The equation can be written as:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

9x = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 yields:

x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To determine the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) * (64 * 4) = (1/4) * 256 = 64

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows. Since Hannah smashes three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) * (32 * 2) = (3/4) * 64 = 48

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars:

Total windows smashed = 64 + 48 = 112

"To determine the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we first need to calculate the total number of blue spools. This can be done by summing the number of light blue and dark blue spools.

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we calculate the total number of spools by adding the number of light blue, dark blue, light green, and dark green spools.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue is 40%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of people who voted by midday. 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday, which is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

Next, we find the number of people remaining after midday. This is 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people.

Then, we calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00. 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by 16:00, which is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

Now, we can find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. This is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00, which is 5000 - 2000 - 2000 = 1000 people.

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we first need to calculate the total number of smores needed. 

9 kids will consume 2 smores each, resulting in a total of 9 * 2 = 18 smores. 
6 adults will consume 1 s'more each, resulting in a total of 6 * 1 = 6 smores.
The total number of smores required is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, the total number of sleeves needed is 24 / 8 = 3.
Given that there are 3 sleeves in a box, the total number of boxes required is 3 / 3 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we must first establish the individual ages of each family member.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. This can be expressed as 2x + 8, where x represents Dora's age. Substituting the given value of x (15) into the equation yields 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, her age can be calculated as 38 - 4 = 34 years.

To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their individual ages together: 15 (Dora's age) + 38 (father's age) + 34 (mother's age) = 87 years.

The final answer is: 87"
"To determine the amount each of Greg's siblings received, we must divide the total sum of money by the number of recipients. In this scenario, the total sum is $20, and the number of recipients is 3 (Greg and his 2 younger siblings).

Therefore, each of Greg's siblings received $6.67."
"To determine the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the weight of each type of book and then sum them up.

First, let's consider the weights of her math and science books. Since they weigh 2 pounds each, their combined weight is 2 x 2 = 4 pounds.

Next, we have her French book, which weighs 4 pounds, and her English book, which weighs 3 pounds.

Lastly, her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate B obtained. Candidate A secured 20% of the total votes, which is equivalent to 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, which translates to 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + 0.5 * 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Since the total number of voters is 100, the combined votes for candidates A and B amount to 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Consequently, candidate C received the remaining votes, which is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, we first need to establish the initial difference in their apple quantities.

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. Therefore, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck's new total becomes 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Boris, on the other hand, now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

To find the difference in their apple quantities, we subtract Beck's new total from Boris's new total: 90 - 87 = 3.

Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris after the transfer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial amount of water.

First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water used for medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces.

Then, we calculate the total amount of water used for small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces.

Now, we sum the total water used for all types of cubes: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as S, the number of books Alice has as A, and the number of books Clara has as C.

We are given that Clara has two times as many books as Steven, which can be expressed as C = 2S. We also know that Clara has 20 books, so we can substitute this value into the equation to find the value of S:

C = 2S
20 = 2S
S = 20 / 2
S = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has. We are given that Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so we can express this as A = S + 6. Substituting the value of S, we get:

A = S + 6
A = 10 + 6
A = 16

Now that we know the number of books each person has, we can find the difference between Clara's and Alice's book collections:

C - A = 20 - 16
C - A = 4

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars, we first need to establish the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

Cost of a gallon jar = $5
Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

With the cost of a half-gallon jar determined, we can now calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Total cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Total cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Total amount of money Cecelia spent = Total cost of 10-gallon jars + Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount of money Cecelia spent = $50 + $48
Total amount of money Cecelia spent = $98

The final answer is: $98"
"To determine the number of students who like to play video games, we can start by identifying the total number of students who have a preference for either baking, basketball, or music. Since there are 50 students in total, and 10 students like to bake and 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music can be calculated as twice the number of students who like to play basketball.

Given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball, we can express this as:

Students who like to play music = 2 * (students who like to play basketball)
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who like to either play video games or music by subtracting the number of students who like to bake and play basketball from the total number of students:

Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball)
= 50 - (10 + 5)
= 50 - 15
= 35

Since we know that students who like to play music = 10, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to play music from the total number of students who like to play video games or music:

Students who like to play video games = Students who like to play video games or music - Students who like to play music
= 35 - 10
= 25

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate one-third of the initial number of birds. 

One-third of 12 is calculated as 12 divided by 3, which equals 4. 

Therefore, 4 birds were scared away. 

Subtracting the number of birds scared away from the initial number, we get 12 - 4 = 8.

After a few minutes, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 

Adding the new birds to the remaining birds, we get 8 + 20 = 28.

The final number of birds in the backyard is 28.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we first need to establish the total number of students in each class. Given that the two classes collectively comprise 80 students, we can infer that each class has an equal number of students. Therefore, we divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of students in each class: 80 / 2 = 40 students per class.

Next, we are informed that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To calculate the number of girls in each class, we multiply the number of students in each class by 40% (or 0.4): 40 * 0.4 = 16 girls per class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class: 40 - 16 = 24 boys per class.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"

"To determine the average number of animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to calculate the total number of animals and then divide by the number of days in a week.

The total number of dogs that need to be bathed is 8, the total number of cats that require nail clipping is 5, the total number of birds that need their wings trimmed is 3, and the total number of horses that need to be brushed is 12.

The total number of animals is the sum of these individual counts: 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7 to find the average number of animals groomed per day: 28 / 7 = 4.

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the profit made by Mark, we first need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue from the packs of old magic cards.

The cost of the packs is calculated by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 3 packs * $1800 = $5400.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from the cards. There are three distinct types of cards: one worth $4000, one worth $1000, and 30 cards worth an average of $50 each. The total revenue from the $50 cards is found by multiplying the number of cards by their average value: 30 * $50 = $1500. The total revenue from all the cards is the sum of the values of the individual cards: $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The profit is then calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

"To determine the weekly savings of the tomato vendor, we first need to calculate the daily savings. This can be done by subtracting the new cost per tomato from the original cost per tomato, then multiplying the result by the number of tomatoes sold daily.

Daily savings = (500 * 0.5) - (500 * 0.4)
Daily savings = 250 - 200
Daily savings = 50

Now, we can calculate the weekly savings by multiplying the daily savings by 7.

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = 50 * 7
Weekly savings = 350

"Given that Sean possesses 56 marbles, we can deduce the number of marbles Cal and Carl have through a series of logical deductions. 

Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can infer that Cal has twice the number of marbles as Sean. Therefore, Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

Furthermore, it is stated that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Consequently, Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

To determine the combined total of marbles Carl and Cal possess, we simply add their respective quantities: 224 (Carl) + 112 (Cal) = 336.

The final answer is: $\boxed{336}$"
"To determine the number of additional groups needed to form, we first need to calculate the number of students per group. This can be achieved by dividing the total number of students by the initial number of groups.

Given that there are 54 students and 6 groups, we can calculate the number of students per group as follows:

Students per group = Total students / Initial number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we are informed that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students required for 12 groups, we multiply the number of groups by the students per group.

Total students required = Number of groups * Students per group
Total students required = 12 * 9
Total students required = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups.

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

To find the number of additional groups required, we divide the additional students required by the students per group.

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

"To determine the total number of chairs rented by Candy in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the average number of chairs rented per week and then multiply it by the total number of weeks in two months.

First, let's calculate the average number of chairs rented per week. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. 

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekend days: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, we need to calculate the total number of weeks in two months. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, two months would have 8 weeks.

To find the total number of chairs rented in two months, we multiply the total chairs rented in a week by the total number of weeks in two months:
500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

"To determine the current inventory of glasses and plates, we must first calculate the initial number of items sent and then subtract the number of broken items.

The initial number of glasses sent is 8 dozen, which is equivalent to 8 * 12 = 96 glasses. Similarly, the initial number of plates sent is 4 dozen, which is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Upon return, 10 glasses and 6 plates were found to be broken. To find the current inventory, we subtract the number of broken items from the initial number of items:

Glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Plates: 48 - 6 = 42

Therefore, Jeff currently has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

The final answer is: $\boxed{86}$"
"To determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has after trading stickers, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

First, let's consider the value of her initial stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. Each large sticker is worth three small stickers, so the total value of her large stickers in terms of small stickers is 40 * 3 = 120 small stickers. Therefore, the total value of her initial stickers is 30 (small stickers) + 120 (small stickers) = 150 small stickers.

Now, let's consider the trades. Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. This is equivalent to trading 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she receives 27 small buttons from this trade.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. This is equivalent to trading 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she receives 20 large buttons from this trade.

Finally, she trades the remaining large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she receives 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from this trade.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has. She has 27 small buttons from the first trade, 20 large buttons from the second trade, and 60 small buttons from the third trade. However, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons to get a total count. Since each large button is worth three small buttons, she has 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from the large buttons.

Therefore, the total number of buttons she has is 27 (small buttons) + 60 (small buttons) + 60 (small buttons) = 147 buttons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"

"To determine the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes on the council is 33. Therefore, the sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation is equal to 33. This can be expressed as:

x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 33

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 11

Since x represents the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we need to calculate the number of students for each size and add them together.

First, we establish the number of students for each size. Let's denote the number of students who need extra-small shirts as E, small as S, medium as M, large as L, and extra-large as XL.

We are given that E = 11. Since twice as many students need size small as extra small, S = 2E = 2 * 11 = 22.

The number of students who need size medium is four less than the number of size small students, so M = S - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18.

Next, we find the number of students who need size large, which is half as many as size medium, L = M / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9.

Finally, the number of students who need size extra-large is six more than the number of size large students, XL = L + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15.

Now, we can calculate the total number of shirts ordered by adding the number of students for each size together: E + S + M + L + XL = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

"To determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win the big race, we first need to calculate the number of individuals who think horse #2 will win and then the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of the total 50 people think horse #2 will win. This can be calculated as 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 individuals.

Next, we calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win, which is 60% of the remaining 40 people. This can be calculated as 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people: 40 - 24 = 16 people.

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16.

"To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we can start by analyzing the given information. We are told that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. This implies that the total number of Pomeranians is 3 times the number of Pomeranian girls, which is 3 * 6 = 18.

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we have determined that there are 18 Pomeranians, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of puppies. Let x represent the total number of puppies. The proportion can be written as:

2/3 * x = 18

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

x = 18 * (3/2)
x = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we can establish a relationship between the number of cases required for each house. Let's denote the number of cases the second house needs as x.

Given that the first house requires half the number of cases the second house needs, we can express this as x/2. 

The third house, on the other hand, needs double the number of cases the first house requires, which translates to 2 * (x/2) = x.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. We can express this as an equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2, resulting in 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 500.

Dividing both sides by 5, we find that x = 100.

Since the third house requires the same number of cases as the second house, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"

First, let's consider Monday. Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her hourly earnings are $15, so her total earnings for the hours worked are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Additionally, since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an extra $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

Next, let's consider Wednesday. Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her hourly earnings are $15, so her total earnings for the hours worked are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches fewer than 3 classes, she does not receive the additional $5 per day. Thus, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

To find the total earnings for the two days, we add the earnings for Monday and Wednesday: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we first calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents, and since there are 4 vanilla scents available, the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

Similarly, the company sold 2 fruity scents, and with 8 fruity scents available, the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold.

Difference = Number of vanilla scents sold - Number of fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the selling price of each ear of corn, we first need to calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of the eggplants. Since Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, the total revenue from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Given that Bennet aims to make a total of $135, the remaining revenue required from the sale of corn is $135 - $60 = $75.

With 25 ears of corn available for sale, we can calculate the selling price per ear by dividing the total revenue needed from corn ($75) by the number of ears (25).

$75 / 25 = $3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 to meet his target revenue of $135.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we must first calculate the total time available and the time allocated to soccer.

The total time available for the weekend is the sum of the hours on Saturday and Sunday, which is 7 hours and 5 hours, respectively. Therefore, the total time available is 12 hours.

Tatiana dedicates 3 hours to reading, leaving 9 hours of remaining time. She then allocates 1/3 of this remaining time to playing video games, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

The time spent playing soccer is the difference between the total time available and the time spent reading and playing video games. This is calculated as 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100. This yields (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer is 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, Anthony gives 1/2 of his 50 pencils to Brandon. This can be calculated as 50 * (1/2) = 25 pencils given to Brandon. Consequently, Anthony is left with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

Next, Anthony gives 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find 3/5 of 25, we can multiply 25 by 3/5, which yields 25 * (3/5) = 15 pencils given to Charlie. Following this, Anthony is left with 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total duration of Jack's excursion, we must consider both the time spent traveling to and from the museum, as well as the time he spends at the museum itself.

First, we calculate the time required for the round trip to the museum. Given that the distance to the museum is 150 miles and Jack's speed is 75 mph, we can use the formula Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken for each leg of the trip.

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours
Time to drive back home = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

The total time spent driving is the sum of these two values: 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

Next, we add the time Jack spends at the museum, which is given as 6 hours. Therefore, the total duration of his excursion is 4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left after assembling the toys, we first need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles. 

The number of wheels needed for the cars can be calculated by multiplying the number of cars by the number of wheels per car: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels. 

Similarly, the number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is found by multiplying the number of motorcycles by the number of wheels per motorcycle: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

The total number of wheels required for both the cars and the motorcycles is the sum of the wheels needed for each: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the initial number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{276}$"
"To determine the final price of the laptop after a 20% discount, we first need to calculate the discount amount. This can be done by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage, which is 0.20 in decimal form.

Discount amount = $1000 * 0.20
Discount amount = $200

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price.

Final price = Original price - Discount amount
Final price = $1000 - $200
Final price = $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we must first identify the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies.

The number of movies in series is one-third of the total number of movies, which is 600. Therefore, the number of movies in series is 600 / 3 = 200.

Since Mike can purchase these movies at a discounted rate of $6 each, the total cost of the movies in series is 200 * $6 = $1200.

Next, we calculate the number of remaining movies by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies: 600 - 200 = 400.

Forty percent of the remaining movies are older movies, so the number of older movies is 400 * 0.4 = 160.

The cost of the older movies is then 160 * $5 = $800.

The remaining movies are normal movies, which is 400 - 160 = 240.

The cost of the normal movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we sum the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies: $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

The final answer is: $4400"
"To determine the total amount spent by Winston on the fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

The cost of peaches is calculated as the product of the weight of peaches picked (6 pounds) and the price per pound ($2.00), yielding a cost of $12.00. Similarly, the cost of plums is found by multiplying the weight of plums picked (8 pounds) by the price per pound ($1.00), resulting in a cost of $8.00. Lastly, the cost of apricots is obtained by multiplying the weight of apricots picked (6 pounds) by the price per pound ($3.00), giving a cost of $18.00.

The total cost is then obtained by summing the individual costs of peaches, plums, and apricots: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To determine the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we must first calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then sum these values.

The family's driving speed was 50 miles per hour. To find their hiking speed, we note that it is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 20 miles per hour.

The distance driven can be calculated using the formula distance = speed * time. Given that they drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour, the distance driven is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

To find the distance hiked, we apply the same formula. The family hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so the distance hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked, which is 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To determine the difference in the scores of Ava and Emma, we need to establish a relationship between their scores based on the given information.

Let's denote Emma's score as E. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is E + 8. Similarly, since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is E + 3. 

Given that Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, her timer score is 30(60 - (E + 4)) = 30(56 - E) = 1680 - 30E.

Emma's total score is E, which is the sum of her enemy score, berry score, and timer score. However, since we don't have information about Emma's enemy and berry scores, we can't directly calculate her total score.

Ava's total score is the sum of her enemy score, berry score, and timer score, which is (E + 8) + (E + 3) + (1680 - 30E) = 1687 - 22E.

The difference in their scores is Ava's score minus Emma's score, which is (1687 - 22E) - E = 1687 - 23E.

However, we still need to find the value of E to determine the difference in their scores. Since we don't have any information about the value of E, we can use the fact that the difference in their scores is the sum of the differences in their enemy and berry scores, and the difference in their timer scores.

The difference in their enemy scores is 8.
The difference in their berry scores is 3.
The difference in their timer scores is 30(60 - (E + 4)) - 30(60 - E) = 30(-4) = -120.

The difference in their scores is 8 + 3 - 120 = -109.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-109}$"
"To determine the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since each of these pizzas costs 30 dollars, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Next, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza. Therefore, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. This can be calculated as 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying W white fish and O orange fish, he had 3 + O orange fish and 4 + W white fish. Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so W + O = 17.

We can solve the first equation for O: O = 2(4 + W) - 3 = 8 + 2W - 3 = 5 + 2W.

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the second equation: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combine like terms: 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we must first calculate the total distance he travels in a week. Given that the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, and he commutes to and from work, the daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy works from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency, which is 10 miles per gallon (MPG). Therefore, the weekly fuel consumption is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can determine the total weekly cost by multiplying the weekly fuel consumption by the price of gas, which is $3 per gallon. Thus, the weekly cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, we first need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent.

The value of the quarters is calculated by multiplying the number of quarters by their respective value: 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, we calculate the value of the twenties she spent. Since Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, we can find this value by multiplying the total value of the twenties by 3/5: (3/5) * $200 = $120.

Now, we can find the total amount of money she spent by adding the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent: $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can obtain from his garden, we need to calculate the yield of each type of plant and then sum the results.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes: 5 tomato plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants: 8 eggplant plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants.

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the overall yield: 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

The final answer is: $\boxed{142}$"
"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the combined proportion of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. One-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs, which is equivalent to 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. Similarly, one-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The combined proportion of smart and analog TVs is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs. To find the proportion of OLED TVs, we subtract this value from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the amount of money John is missing, we first need to calculate the portion of the trip cost that the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Half of the trip cost = $300 / 2 = $150

This means the school will cover $150, and John has $50. To find out how much John is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the amount the school will cover:

Amount John is missing = Amount school will cover - Amount John has
= $150 - $50

"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we must first calculate the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point.

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night. Therefore, the temperature during the night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

The temperature difference between the freezing point (32 degrees) and the night temperature (12 degrees) is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can calculate the number of logs needed by dividing the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of seashells brought back by the groups, we first need to calculate the number of groups formed and then the number of groups that brought back seashells.

Given that 90 people were required to split into groups, and 9-person groups were formed, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we find the number of groups that brought back seashells. It is given that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. Therefore, the number of groups that brought back seashells is:

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we can calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups:

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

"To determine the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at a 25% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal).

Discount = 0.25 * $40
Discount = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the price after the discount.

Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

"To determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we must first calculate the total hours she has played. 

In the initial two weeks, Kris plays for half an hour every day. Since there are 14 days in two weeks, the total hours played in this period is 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

Next, we consider the subsequent week where Kris plays for 2 hours every day. With 7 days in a week, the total hours played in this period is 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

The total hours Kris has played is the sum of these two periods, which is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find the remaining hours needed to achieve the 30-hour target, we subtract the total hours played from the target: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. Using the formula for distance (d = rt), where d is the distance, r is the rate (or speed), and t is the time, we can calculate the distance traveled by the first car as follows:

d1 = rt
d1 = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
d1 = 120 miles

The second car travels at a constant speed of 70 miles per hour. Using the same formula, we can calculate the distance traveled by the second car as follows:

d2 = rt
d2 = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
d2 = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars will be the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:

d = d2 - d1
d = 140 miles - 120 miles
d = 20 miles

Therefore, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours is 20 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the ring, we must first calculate the total cost of the diamond and the gold. The cost of the diamond is $600, and the cost of the gold is $300. Therefore, the total cost of the diamond and the gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

Next, we need to calculate the premium, which is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3, resulting in $270. 

The total cost of the ring, including the premium, is the sum of the total cost of the diamond and gold and the premium, which is $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To determine the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade. We know that 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, and 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed. The pass rate for the 400 fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders. Since the pass rate of the fourth-graders is 40/100, the pass rate of the fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. Therefore, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, we need to find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we first need to calculate the total number of square inches that can be covered with the available glass chips. Given that each square inch requires 12 glass chips and Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips as follows:

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Next, we can find the total number of square inches that can be covered with the available chips by dividing the total number of chips by the number of chips required per square inch:

Total square inches = Total chips / Chips per square inch
= 144 / 12
= 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length of the mosaic by dividing the total area by the height:

Length = Total square inches / Height
= 12 / 3
= 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long."
"To determine the initial amount of tea at the party, we must first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, resulting in a total of 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

Additionally, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, totaling 16 * 2 = 32 quarts. 

The total amount of tea consumed is the sum of these two quantities, which is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea consumed to gallons by dividing by 4. However, to find the initial amount of tea, we must also account for the 10 quarts remaining.

The initial amount of tea is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea remaining, which is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Converting this to gallons, we divide by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

Therefore, the initial amount of tea at the party was 12 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we must first calculate the total number of candies he has available for sale. Initially, Dale ordered 100 candies. However, he sold 150 candies, resulting in a deficit of 50 candies. To rectify this situation, Dale ordered an additional 100 candies.

Now, we can calculate the total number of candies Dale has available for sale. The initial order of 100 candies plus the additional 100 candies ordered equals 200 candies. Since Dale sold 150 candies, we subtract this number from the total to find the number of candies he still needs to sell.

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, we need to calculate the number of times the initial number of students doubles from January to May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

The number of students at the end of May is 160. To find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we can start by calculating the total number of branches he climbed during the week. Given that he made $105 and charges $0.25 per branch, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total amount of money made by the cost per branch.

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked for 5 days, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by the number of days.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we must first calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers. 

The first set consists of 3 flowers with 5 petals each, resulting in 3 * 5 = 15 petals. The second set comprises 4 flowers with 6 petals each, yielding 4 * 6 = 24 petals. The third set consists of 5 flowers with 4 petals each, giving us 5 * 4 = 20 petals. Lastly, the fourth set consists of 6 flowers with 7 petals each, resulting in 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

Now, we sum the total number of petals from each set: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

However, Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, which amounts to a total of 4 petals. Therefore, we must subtract these lost petals from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals.

The final answer is: 97"
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows remaining after accounting for those used and dropped.

The initial number of marshmallows in the bag is 35. John and DeSean each make 9 S'mores, which requires 18 marshmallows in total. Additionally, 3 marshmallows are dropped, resulting in a total of 21 marshmallows being used or dropped.

To find the remaining marshmallows, we subtract the total used and dropped from the initial amount: 35 - 21 = 14.

Now, we divide the remaining marshmallows by the number of kids to determine how many S'mores each can have: 14 / 2 = 7.

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total amount of money used at the arcade, we must first calculate the total time played by each individual. 

Jack, being the most skilled player, can play for 20 minutes with a single quarter. His two less skilled friends can play for half the time, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. The more skilled friend, on the other hand, can play for 1.5 times the time, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

The total time played by Jack is 4 hours, which is equivalent to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. The two less skilled friends play for 240 minutes each, and the more skilled friend plays for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played by all four individuals is 240 + 240 + 240 + 360 = 1080 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

The total amount of money used is 1080 * 0.05 = $54.

The final answer is: $54"
"To determine the amount of oil Tanya uses in her salt scrub, we can establish a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x, the amount of salt (and sugar) as 2x, and the amount of oil as 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, which is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 8x = 10.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, we can calculate the amount of oil as 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses in her salt scrub is 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount of money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats can be calculated by multiplying the number of goats by the cost per goat: 3 goats * $500 = $1500.

Similarly, the cost of the cows can be calculated by multiplying the number of cows by the cost per cow: 2 cows * $1500 = $3000.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500 at the market.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine the number of additional cupcakes Paul should purchase, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of cupcakes required and the number of cupcakes he already possesses.

The total number of cupcakes Paul needs is 63. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which amounts to a total of 48 cupcakes.

To find the number of additional cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes required:

63 (total cupcakes needed) - 48 (cupcakes already have) = 15

Therefore, Paul should purchase 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother, we first need to establish the initial number of cars Joe possesses. Given that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, we can infer that Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, we calculate the number of cars Joe sells, which is 20% of his total. This can be computed as 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Furthermore, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which equates to 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Therefore, the total number of cars Joe gives away is the sum of the cars he sold and the cars he gave away, which is 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

To find the number of cars Joe remains with, we subtract the total number of cars given away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we first need to calculate the total amount raised by the students. Given that the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students collectively raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

To find the individual contribution of each student, we divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20).

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250."
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we first need to calculate the time she spent walking on each day. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day. Therefore, the time spent on the second day is 8 hours / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour. 

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first calculate the number of cars present in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, resulting in a total of 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, it is stated that 1/2 of the cars had left. This implies that 1/2 of 70 had departed, leaving 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars remaining in the parking lot.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, which would be the number of cars present when he got out of class for the lunch break.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we first need to calculate his daily earnings. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of cycles he completes in a day by the number of tasks within each cycle and the compensation for each task.

Number of cycles per day: 30
Number of tasks per cycle: 5
Pay per task: $1.20

Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

To find John's weekly earnings, we then multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a week, which is 7.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To determine the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate her points in each game and then sum them.

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. 

Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. Therefore, Julie's score in the first game is 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add Sasha's points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food purchased by Kimberly, we first calculate the total number of tins of each type. 

The number of tins of cat food can be found by multiplying the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Similarly, the number of tins of dog food is obtained by multiplying the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

The difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food is then calculated by subtracting the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the number of cards PJ has as x. Given that Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick's collection can be represented as 3x. Becca's collection is 12 more than Smendrick's, so it can be expressed as 3x + 12.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. This can be represented by the equation:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides yields:
7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7 gives us:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can determine the number of cards Smendrick has by multiplying x by 3, which results in 141 cards. To find Becca's collection, we add 12 to 3x, giving us 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

Therefore, Becca has 147 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we must first establish the quantities of each color. 

Let's begin by identifying the number of green eggs, which is given as 5. 

Next, we are informed that Cindy has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is 2 * 5 = 10.

We are also told that the number of pink eggs is one fewer than the number of blue eggs. Consequently, the number of pink eggs is 10 - 1 = 9.

Lastly, the number of yellow eggs is one-third the number of pink eggs. Hence, the number of yellow eggs is 9 / 3 = 3.

To find the total number of eggs, we sum the quantities of each color: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping. The cost per pound is $0.35, and the weight of the book is 4 pounds. Additionally, the cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance to the distribution center is 20 miles. Therefore, the total cost of shipping is calculated as follows:

Cost of shipping = (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20)
= 1.4 + 1.6
= $2.99

Next, we need to determine the refund amount. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we can calculate the refund amount as follows:

Refund amount = 0.75 * 32
= $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:

Total loss = Cost of shipping + (Purchase price - Refund amount)
= 2.99 + (32 - 24)
= 2.99 + 8
= $10.99

The final answer is: $10.99"
"To determine the amount of money Mulan has left, we must first calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving the additional funds from her father. Initially, Mulan had $40. Following the contribution from her father, her total becomes $40 + $100 = $140.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent on the items she purchased. Two pairs of jeans at $30 each will cost 2 * $30 = $60. Additionally, she bought a bag for $20. Therefore, the total amount spent is $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.

To find the amount of money Mulan has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the amount of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we must first calculate the total production for the first three weeks. 

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate. 
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

The total production for the first three weeks is the sum of the individual weekly productions: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars in a month, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on various activities per week and then multiply it by 4 to account for the four weeks in a month.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on writing songs per week. Since she spends 2 hours on this activity, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the time Britany spends on makeup per week. She spends 15 minutes on this activity six days a week, so we can find the total weekly time by multiplying 15 minutes by 6: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time Britany spends on recording videos per week. She records 18 videos, each lasting 4 minutes, so the total time spent on recording videos per week is 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.

To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok per week, we add the time spent on writing songs, makeup, and recording videos: 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes.

Converting the total weekly time to hours, we get 282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours.

Finally, to find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 4.7 hours * 4 weeks = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18.8}$"
"To determine the total cost of the installation, we must first identify the items that are included in the initial package and those that are additional. The initial package includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, with a total cost of $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. To calculate the cost of the additional items, we must subtract the number of items included in the initial package from the total number of items Angela has.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors, cost: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier, cost: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures, cost: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the initial package to the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To determine the amount of money Roy has saved, we can start by establishing the amount saved by his sister, Eva, which is $20.00. Given that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate his savings as $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Next, we need to find the amount saved by Roy, who has 40% more than Anthony. To calculate 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4, which yields $12.00. To find the total amount saved by Roy, we add this 40% to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Therefore, the amount of money Roy has saved is $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To determine the height at which Naruto can lift a mountain, we must establish a hierarchical relationship between the individuals' lifting capabilities. 

Pompei's lifting capacity serves as the baseline, with a value of 1 inch. Saskay's capacity is 12 times greater than Pompei's, resulting in a value of 12 inches. 

Kagiyami's capacity is 4 times greater than Saskay's, which yields a value of 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto's capacity is 10 times greater than Kagiyami's, leading to a value of 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert this value to feet, we divide by 12, as there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Mason, we can utilize the formula Distance = Speed x Time. Given that Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance covered in each segment of his journey.

For the initial 4 hours, the distance traveled is 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles. Subsequently, during the next 6 hours, he covers a distance of 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles.

By summing these two distances, we can obtain the total distance traveled by Mason. Therefore, the total distance is 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, we first need to establish the time it takes for a single kangaroo to make the journey. Given that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take a total of 18 hours to cross the highway, we can infer that the time for one kangaroo is 18 hours multiplied by 3, which equals 54 hours.

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it logically follows that they will require twice as much time to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is 54 hours multiplied by 2, resulting in 108 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{108}$"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can establish a relationship between their production quantities. Let's denote the number of dishes made by Kora as K, Rory as R, and Jada as J.

Given that Kora made 20 dishes, we have K = 20.

It is also stated that Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so we can express this as R = K + 20. Substituting the value of K, we get R = 20 + 20 = 40.

Furthermore, Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, which can be expressed as J = 2R. Substituting the value of R, we get J = 2 * 40 = 80.

To find the total number of dishes they made together, we add the number of dishes each person made: K + R + J = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we need to consider the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution. 

First, we calculate the reduced price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 and her mom gave her $80, so the total amount of money she received is: 
$150 + $80 = $230

Since Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs: 
$400 + $50 = $450

Now, we can calculate the initial amount of money Erika had in her purse by subtracting the amount she received from the total amount she has: 
$450 - $230 = $220

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the number of apple slices left after Adam eats 15 slices, we first need to calculate the total number of slices available. 

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam has 3 large apples. Therefore, the total number of slices from large apples is 3 x 5 = 15.

Similarly, a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam has 5 small apples. Thus, the total number of slices from small apples is 5 x 3 = 15.

The total number of slices available is the sum of the slices from large and small apples, which is 15 + 15 = 30.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of cows required to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we first need to establish the milk production rate per cow. Given that each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we can calculate the total number of cows needed to achieve the desired production rate.

Let's denote the number of cows required as 'x'. The total milk production can be represented as 5x liters per day. We want this to be equal to 25 liters per day.

5x = 25

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5.

x = 25 / 5
x = 5

This means that 5 cows are required to produce 25 liters of milk per day. Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find the difference between the required number of cows and the number of cows he already has.

Number of cows needed = 5 - 3
Number of cows needed = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 of its original length remaining. Given that the original length of a glue stick is 12 millimeters, we can calculate the unused portion as follows:

1/6 * 12 = 2 millimeters

The second glue stick has 2/3 of its original length remaining. We can calculate the unused portion as follows:

2/3 * 12 = 8 millimeters

The third glue stick has 1/2 of its original length remaining. We can calculate the unused portion as follows:

1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions together to find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used:

2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"To determine the amount of money Gabriel still needs, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to acquire. The car costs $10,000 and the phone costs $800, resulting in a total cost of $10,000 + $800 = $10,800.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently possesses. He has earned $5,000 from working on weekends and received an additional $200 from his brother, totaling $5,000 + $200 = $5,200.

To find the amount of money Gabriel still requires, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost of the items: $10,800 - $5,200 = $4,800.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $4,800."
"To determine the change Thea received, we need to calculate the difference between the amount she gave the craftsman and the cost of the hat.

The amount Thea gave the craftsman is $80, as she provided four $20 bills. The cost of the hat is $70.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hat from the amount given: $80 - $70 = $10.

Therefore, Thea received $10 as change."
"To determine the amount of money Craig has left, we must first calculate the total amount he spent on the items he purchased. 

Craig initially has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which equates to a total of $40. He then spends $12 on 6 squirt guns, each costing $2, and $9 on 3 packs of water balloons, each costing $3. 

The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the squirt guns and the water balloons, which is $12 + $9 = $21.

To find the amount of money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Therefore, Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, we can establish a relationship between the number of socks and dishes collected by Jack and Peter. Let's denote the number of socks Jack collected as S and the number of dishes Jack collected as D.

Given that Jack collected 60 dishes, we have D = 60.

It is also given that Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so we can express this relationship as D = 2S. Substituting the value of D, we get 60 = 2S, which implies S = 30.

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter's socks = 2S = 2 * 30 = 60.

Additionally, Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter's dishes = D/2 = 60/2 = 30.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the individual counts: Total socks = S + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = D + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To determine the number of students good at math, we can utilize a Venn diagram or the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of students good at math as M, the number of students good at English as E, and the number of students good at both as B.

Given that T = 20, M - B = 5 (students good at math only), and E - B = 8 (students good at English only), we can calculate the number of students good at both subjects as B = M - (M - B) = 5.

Now, we can find the total number of students good at math by adding the students good at math only and those good at both subjects: M = (M - B) + B = 5 + 7 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the maximum number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

Each group requires 10 minutes for setup, performance, and teardown. The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. However, there is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes to perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

Therefore, the maximum number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we can calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the original amount. The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

This represents a geometric series where the first term (a) is $300, the common ratio (r) is 1.75 (1 + 0.75), and the number of terms (n) is 3. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula: S = a * ((1 - r^n) / (1 - r)).

Plugging in the values, we get: S = $300 * ((1 - 1.75^3) / (1 - 1.75))
S = $300 * ((1 - 5.359375) / (-0.75))
S = $300 * (-4.359375 / -0.75)
S = $300 * 5.8125
S = $1753.125

However, this is not the correct approach for this problem. The correct approach is to recognize that the interest is being added to the principal each year, resulting in an exponential increase. The correct formula for the total amount after n years is A = P * (1 + r)^n, where P is the principal, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of years.

Using this formula, we get: A = $300 * (1 + 0.75)^3
A = $300 * 2.75^3
A = $300 * 16.40625
A = $4891.875

The final answer is: $4891.88"
"To determine the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we first need to find the number of floral shirts with buttons. Given that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 20. Consequently, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

To find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars, we subtract the latter from the former: 30 - 20 = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the farmer's earnings, we first need to calculate the number of trays he can fill with the given number of eggs. This can be done by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30

Now, we can calculate the farmer's earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray.

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the number of goats left in Farm X, we first subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm X. The initial number of goats in Farm X is 55, and the number of goats sold is 10. Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

Next, we calculate the number of goats sold from Farm Y. Since Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as from Farm X, and he sold 10 goats from Farm X, the number of goats sold from Farm Y is 10 * 2 = 20.

Now, we find the number of goats left in Farm Y by subtracting the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm Y. The initial number of goats in Farm Y is 45, and the number of goats sold is 20. Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y. The number of goats left in Farm X is 45, and the number of goats left in Farm Y is 25. Therefore, the total number of goats left is 45 + 25 = 70.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to calculate the total expenditure on shoes per year and divide it by the number of pairs purchased annually.

Given that James spends $2640 on shoes each year and he buys 2 pairs of shoes per month, we can calculate the total number of pairs purchased per year as follows:

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we can calculate the average cost per pair by dividing the total expenditure by the number of pairs purchased:

$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

Therefore, James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, we must first calculate the individual costs and then apply the discount for the red food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75. 
The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

The total cost before the discount is the sum of the costs of the green and red food baskets, which is $75 + $54 = $129.

However, we also need to account for the discount on the red food. Since we are purchasing 3 baskets of red food and each basket receives a $2 discount, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

Therefore, the total cost after the discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To determine the time required to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of this number is 45 rooms.

Now, we can calculate the total time it takes to clean these rooms. Given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert this time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour.

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them together.

In the first year, the town will construct 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote my age as 'x', my brother's age as 'x + 3', my sister's age as 'x - 2', and my mom's age as '3(x + 3) - 1'.

We know that the sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. Let's try to find a whole number solution.

We can rewrite the equation as: 8x = 70.

Since 8x is a multiple of 8, we can try to find a whole number solution by dividing 70 by 8. However, 70 is not a multiple of 8, so we need to find the closest multiple of 8 that is less than or equal to 70.

The closest multiple of 8 that is less than or equal to 70 is 64. However, 64 is not equal to 70, so we need to find the next multiple of 8.

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for his students. Given that there are 27 students in his class and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we can calculate the number of packs required by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack. This yields 54 / 8 = 6.75.

However, since Mr. Jackson can only purchase whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure that every student has 2 glue sticks and that there are some extra glue sticks left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river at a specific point, we must consider the changes in water volume over the course of three days.

On the first day, the initial volume of water is 4000 gallons. 

On the second day, the volume of water doubles, resulting in a new volume of 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water increases by an additional 6000 gallons, leading to a final volume of 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we sum the volumes from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24000}$"
"To determine the total number of people infected after three days, we can model this situation using an exponential growth equation. The number of people infected each day is a result of the previous day's total, multiplied by the infection rate (6 in this case).

Day 1: 
- The initial number of infected people is 10.
- The number of new infections on Day 1 is 10 * 6 = 60.
- The total number of people infected after Day 1 is 10 + 60 = 70.

Day 2: 
- The number of new infections on Day 2 is 70 * 6 = 420.
- The total number of people infected after Day 2 is 70 + 420 = 490.

Day 3: 
- The number of new infections on Day 3 is 490 * 6 = 2940.
- The number of new infections from the initial 10 people is 10 * 6 = 60.
- The number of new infections from the 60 people infected on Day 1 is 60 * 6 = 360.
- The total number of new infections on Day 3 is 2940 + 60 + 360 = 3360.
- The total number of people infected after Day 3 is 490 + 3360 = 2850.

However, this is not the correct answer. We must also consider the 60 people infected on Day 1, who were not included in the 490 people infected on Day 2. These 60 people will also infect others on Day 3. The number of new infections from these 60 people is 60 * 6 = 360. Therefore, the total number of new infections on Day 3 is 2940 + 360 = 3300. The total number of people infected after Day 3 is 490 + 3300 = 3790.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3790}$"
"To determine the total amount of money received by Julieta and Rafaela as tips, we first need to calculate the individual amounts received by each of them.

Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, each giving $20. Therefore, her total tips amount to 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, which can be calculated as 90% of Rafaela's total tips. This is equivalent to 0.9 * $800 = $720.

The total amount of money they received as tips is the sum of their individual amounts, which is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, resulting in a total of 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. 
Additionally, she gave her only son 3 oranges. 
Therefore, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Since Jennifer initially purchased 12 oranges, we can find the number of oranges she remained with by subtracting the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial amount: 
12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a 1-year time frame, we can analyze their respective monthly badge-earning rates.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. Given that Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, Amber's monthly badge-earning rate is 1/2 badge per month. Wendy, on the other hand, earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, resulting in a monthly badge-earning rate of 3 badges.

Over a 12-month period, the total number of badges earned by each individual can be calculated as follows:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount raised by Paige, we first need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. Given that she bakes 2 banana bread loaves per hour and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

Number of loaves baked per hour = 2
Number of hours = 5 (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM)
Total number of loaves = 2 * 5 = 10
Total number of slices = 10 * 8 = 80

Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, we need to convert the total number of slices to dollars. To do this, we divide the total number of slices by 100, as there are 100 cents in a dollar.

Total amount in dollars = Total number of slices / 100
= 80 / 100
= 0.8

Now, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised:

Total amount raised = Total number of slices * Price per slice
= 80 * 0.5
= 40

However, this is the amount in dollars and cents. Since the question asks for the amount in dollars, we can express this as a dollar amount with two decimal places.

The final answer is: $40.00"
"To determine the total number of coins Gretchen has, we first need to establish the relationship between the number of gold coins and silver coins. It is given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If we denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G, we can express this relationship as G = S + 30.

Given that Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can substitute this value into the equation G = S + 30 to find the number of silver coins. This yields 70 = S + 30.

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. This can be achieved by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

70 - 30 = S + 30 - 30
40 = S

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = S + G
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we first need to calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George.

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Additionally, Mr. George consumed 20 burritos.

The total number of burritos consumed is the sum of the burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George, which is 500 + 20 = 520.

Given that there were 600 burritos in total, the number of leftover burritos can be calculated as follows:

Total burritos - Total burritos consumed = Leftover burritos
600 - 520 = 80

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, we must first establish the quantities of the other colored cars. 

Given that the rink has 12 red cars, and there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Furthermore, the rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, which yields 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has a total of 75 cars, the number of yellow cars can be calculated as 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that S = A + 25, as Sofie has 25 more books than Anne. Additionally, A = F - 12, as Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

We can express the total number of books as the sum of the books each person has: S + A + F = 85.

Substituting the expression for S into the total equation, we get (A + 25) + A + F = 85. Combining like terms, we have 2A + F + 25 = 85.

Substituting the expression for A into this equation, we get 2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85. Simplifying this, we have 3F - 24 + 25 = 85.

Combining like terms, we get 3F + 1 = 85. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we have 3F = 84.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that F = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we first need to establish the weight of the sweet potatoes. Given that the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the weight of the sweet potatoes can be calculated as 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots, which is 3 pounds less than the weight of the sweet potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To determine the total cost of Jello for Greg's son's birthday party, we first need to calculate the total number of Jello cups required. Given that there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, the total number of Jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since one box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, the number of boxes needed is 120 / 10 = 12.

The cost of one box of Jello is $1.25. Therefore, the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the change the seller will receive, we first need to calculate the total cost of the phones. This can be done by multiplying the number of phones purchased by the price of each phone.

Number of phones: 5
Price per phone: $700

Total cost of phones = Number of phones * Price per phone
Total cost of phones = 5 * $700
Total cost of phones = $3500

Now, we need to find the change the seller will receive. This can be done by subtracting the total cost of the phones from the amount given by the seller.

Amount given by the seller: $4000
Change = Amount given by the seller - Total cost of phones
Change = $4000 - $3500
Change = $500

Therefore, the seller will receive $500 in change."
"To determine the amount Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate his share of the monthly grocery expenses. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

The total monthly expenditure is $400. To find Keenan's share, we calculate 40% of $400, which is 0.4 * 400 = $160.

Now, to find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly expenditure by the number of weeks in the month. Assuming a four-week month, we have:

$160 / 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces consumed on each day and sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces eaten on the first day. Tobias ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. This can be calculated as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. The remaining pieces are 60 - 24 - 10 = 26.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. This can be calculated as follows:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day: 
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Therefore, Tobias has eaten a total of 48 pizza pieces.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to establish the cost of a single unit of each item. 

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

Similarly, the cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To determine the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract this from the initial amount of money he possesses.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wishes to purchase 16 bolts. Therefore, the total cost of the bolts can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost = 16 * $0.03
Total cost = $0.48

Now, we can subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount = $12.48
Total cost = $0.48
Amount left = Initial amount - Total cost
Amount left = $12.48 - $0.48
Amount left = $12.00

Therefore, after purchasing the bolts, David has $12.00 left.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking, we first need to establish her hourly wage. This can be calculated by dividing the total amount earned ($33) by the number of hours worked (3).

Hourly wage = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
= $33 / 3 hours
= $11 per hour

Now, we can calculate her earnings after 12 hours by multiplying her hourly wage by the total number of hours worked.

Earnings after 12 hours = Hourly wage * Total hours worked
= $11 per hour * 12 hours
= $132

Therefore, Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking would be $132.

The final answer is: $132"
"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after receiving the gift from his friend. Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 marbles, so the total number of marbles becomes 52 + 28 = 80.

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Paul lost. He lost 1/4 of his marbles. To calculate 1/4 of 80, we can multiply 80 by 1/4, which is equivalent to dividing 80 by 4. Therefore, 80 / 4 = 20.

Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total marbles he had after receiving the gift: 80 - 20 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she earns from each type of question and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 questions, and Amy correctly answers 80% of them. Since each question is worth 1 point, the total points from multiple-choice questions can be calculated as follows:

10 questions * 0.8 * 1 point = 8 points

Next, we'll calculate the points from the true/false questions. There are 20 questions, and Amy correctly answers 90% of them. Each question is worth 1 point, so the total points from true/false questions can be calculated as follows:

20 questions * 0.9 * 1 point = 18 points

Lastly, we'll calculate the points from the long-answer questions. There are 5 questions, and Amy correctly answers 60% of them. Each question is worth 5 points, so the total points from long-answer questions can be calculated as follows:

5 questions * 0.6 * 5 points = 15 points

Now, we can sum the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score:

8 points + 18 points + 15 points = 41 points

The final answer is: 41"
"To determine the cost price of the chickens Isaias bought for sale, we first need to calculate the total revenue he will generate from selling the chickens. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens at $50 each, we can calculate the total revenue as follows:

Total revenue = (3/5) * 300 * $50
Total revenue = 0.6 * 300 * $50
Total revenue = $9000

However, we are given that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total revenue required to achieve this profit is the sum of the cost price and the desired profit:

Total revenue = Cost price + Profit
$9000 = Cost price + $2000

To find the cost price, we can rearrange the equation:

Cost price = Total revenue - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

Therefore, the cost price of the chickens Isaias bought for sale is $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To determine the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we first need to establish the number of glasses sold by Micah. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, and the total number of glasses sold by both of them is half of the total number of glasses sold, we can calculate this as follows:

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling glasses (excluding Julie) = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Now, we can find the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah by subtracting the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

"To determine the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and sum them together.

First, we establish the cost of the hair service as $400. 

Next, we calculate the cost of the manicure, which is one-fourth of the cost of the hair service: 1/4 * $400 = $100.

Then, we calculate the cost of the pedicure, which is three-fourths of the cost of the manicure: 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, we sum the costs of the hair, manicure, and pedicure services: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"To determine the amount of money Sarah will have left over after purchasing a new rope, we need to calculate the profit she will make from selling the original rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, we calculate the total revenue from selling the rope, which is the product of its length and the selling price per meter. Given that the rope is 20 meters long and is sold for $2 per meter, the total revenue is:

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Next, we calculate the cost of the new rope, which is the product of its length and the purchase price per meter. Since the new rope is also 20 meters long and costs $1.5 per meter, the total cost is:

20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, we can determine the profit by subtracting the cost of the new rope from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $40 - $30
Profit = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after purchasing the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we can start by defining her current age as 'x'. Since in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Let 'y' be the number of years it takes for her age to be thrice her present age. At that time, her age will be 8 + y, and it will be thrice her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

We can set up the equation: 8 + y = 24.

Solving for y, we get y = 24 - 8 = 16.

Therefore, the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age is 16.

"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item. The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10. The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120, since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12. The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14, since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly has overspent her budget by $91.

The final answer is: $-91"
"To determine the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we can establish an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the runtime of her usual concert as x minutes. The final concert, being twice as long as her usual concerts, has a runtime of 2x minutes. Additionally, the encore performance lasts for 15 minutes.

Given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, we can set up the following equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we first isolate the term involving x by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

Therefore, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the current number of toys Argo possesses, we must first calculate the total number of toys he has given away. This can be achieved by summing the toys given to Alyssa, Bonnie, and Nicky.

The number of toys given to Alyssa is 40, to Bonnie is 80, and to Nicky is 30. Therefore, the total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150.

Now, to find the current number of toys Argo has, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys. The initial number of toys Argo had was 200. Subtracting the total number of toys given away (150) from the initial number of toys yields 200 - 150 = 50.

Thus, Argo currently has 50 toys.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we need to calculate the number of chimichangas produced on each day and then sum these values.

The number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday is 125 each. Therefore, the combined total for these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, the number of chimichangas produced is twice the number made on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which is 2 * 125 = 250.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas produced on Tuesday and Wednesday to the number produced on Friday: 250 + 250 = 500.

"To determine the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be accommodated in the available space. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs.

Let's denote the total number of microphones as M. We know that 80% of M will be arranged in pairs. This can be expressed as 0.8M = 2x, where x is the number of pairs of microphones.

Given that the total number of microphones is 50, we can substitute M = 50 into the equation:

0.8 * 50 = 2x
40 = 2x
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies remaining after Lani ate 5 cookies. This can be done by subtracting the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 55 - 5 = 50

Next, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars to find the number of cookies in each jar.

Number of jars = 5
Cookies per jar = Cookies left / Number of jars = 50 / 5 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 cookies in each jar.

"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we first need to establish the relationship between the whatchamacallit and the thingamabob. Given that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, we can express this as a ratio. If we let the speed of the thingamabob be x, then the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x.

We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5x
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Since Ellen eats two carrots, the total cost of the carrots is 2x.

We know that the salad costs $6 and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $3. The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11.

The total cost equation can be represented as: 2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Combining the constants, we get: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtracting 9 from both sides yields: 2x = 2

Dividing both sides by 2 results in: x = 1

Therefore, the cost of one carrot is $1."
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we first need to calculate his new hourly wage after the pay increase. Initially, he earned $10 per hour, and his pay was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we can calculate Mark's weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To determine the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of lawns she mowed and the corresponding payment. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Given that she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x. Similarly, since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

The total number of lawns she mowed is the sum of the lawns mowed for Joe, Kamala, and Alba, which is x + 3x + 5x = 9x.

We are also given that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. Therefore, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

Since we know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

To find the value of y, we can solve for x first. Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y. However, this is not the most efficient approach. Instead, we can solve for x in terms of y.

Rearranging the equation 54x + y = 80 to isolate x, we get x = (80 - y) / 54.

However, we are given that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, which implies that x = 1. Therefore, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y.

54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine Harry's weight, we can establish a step-by-step process based on the given information.

"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the initial number of notebooks Martha had. Since she bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7, we can find her initial number of notebooks by subtracting the additional notebooks from the total.

Martha's initial number of notebooks = Total number of notebooks - Additional notebooks
= 7 - 5
= 2

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find the number of notebooks Joseph had. It is given that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Therefore, we can calculate Joseph's initial number of notebooks as follows:

Joseph's initial number of notebooks = 3 * Martha's initial number of notebooks
= 3 * 2
= 6

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we can subtract Joseph's number of notebooks from Martha's number of notebooks:

"To determine the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we first need to calculate the distance rowed by Anis. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can express this as a mathematical expression.

Let's denote the distance rowed by Dijana as D. Then, the distance rowed by Anis is D + (1/5)D, which simplifies to (6/5)D.

Given that Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can substitute this value into the expression for Anis's distance: (6/5) * 50 = 60 miles.

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances: 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the number of cookies each of Susan's nephews will receive, we must first account for the cookies taken by her husband. Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, the total number of cookies remaining is 100 - 4 = 96.

To find the number of cookies each nephew will receive, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. This can be expressed as a division operation: 96 Ã· 6.

Performing the division, we get 96 Ã· 6 = 16.

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will receive 16 cookies.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 5 + 13 = 18 pages. 
Daniel did not read any pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.
Daniel's total pages read = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To determine the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to consider the capacity of the pot and the number of people eating dinner.

The pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since there are 4 adults (Calvin, his wife, and 2 children) eating dinner, and each person eats one bowl, 4 adult bowls will be used. 

Since 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls, a total of 4 child bowls will also be used. This leaves 4 child bowls of soup remaining.

There are 2 children, and each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. To find the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup, we divide the remaining child bowls by the number of children: 4 / 2 = 2.

Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To determine the total amount of material required, we need to calculate the material needed for small and large masks separately and then sum them.

First, let's calculate the material required for small masks. Given that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks, the material per small mask is 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per mask. Therefore, the material needed for 20 small masks is 20 * 0.5 yards = 10 yards.

Next, we calculate the material required for large masks. Since 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks, the material per large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per mask. Consequently, the material needed for 8 large masks is 8 * 0.75 yards = 6 yards.

To find the total material required, we sum the material needed for small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To determine the number of red and blue shoeboxes left in Tim's box, we first need to calculate the number of red shoeboxes he used for fishing. Since he used 1/3 of his red shoeboxes, we can find this by dividing the total number of red shoeboxes by 3.

Number of red shoeboxes used = 9 / 3 = 3

Now, we know that Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes for fishing. Initially, he had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. 

To find the number of blue shoeboxes left, we subtract the number of blue shoeboxes used from the initial number of blue shoeboxes:
Blue shoeboxes left = 7 - 3 = 4

Similarly, to find the number of red shoeboxes left, we subtract the number of red shoeboxes used from the initial number of red shoeboxes:
Red shoeboxes left = 9 - 3 = 6

"To solve this problem, we can start by defining Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago

Substituting the known value for Duncan's current age (60) into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2x

Simplifying the equation, we have:

52 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 26

This value represents Adam's age four years ago. To determine Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4 = 26 + 4 = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

"To determine the total acres of both farms, we first need to calculate the acres of Farmer Smith's farm. This can be done by doubling the acres of Farmer Brown's farm and then adding 100 to the result.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Doubling this yields 2 * 200 = 400 acres. Adding 100 to this value gives 400 + 100 = 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, we can find the total acres of both farms by adding the acres of each farm together. This results in 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To determine Colby's earnings in a typical eight-hour workday, we first need to calculate the total number of packages he completes within that timeframe. Given that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can express this as 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of packages completed in an 8-hour workday by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours worked: 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.

Since Colby is paid $0.20 for each package, his total earnings for the day can be calculated as follows: 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.

Therefore, Colby's earnings in a typical eight-hour workday are $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks while solving a sudoku puzzle, we first need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku. Given that a normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes, we can calculate the number of bottles he drinks by dividing the total time by 30.

Number of bottles = Total time / Time per bottle
= 180 minutes / 30 minutes
= 6 bottles

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of yellow balloons in the bundle, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of balloons is 20 + y.

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, resulting in a total of 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons.

Similarly, he threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, resulting in a total of 3 * y pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons.

Given that the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, we can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

To solve for y, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 18.

Then, we divide both sides by 3: y = 6.

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car requires, we must first calculate the total distance he travels in a 30-day period. Given that he drives 100 miles per day, the total distance can be computed as follows:

Total distance = 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car necessitates a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can calculate the number of tune-ups required by dividing the total distance by 1000.

Number of tune-ups = Total distance / 1000 = 3000 / 1000 = 3

Therefore, Jon's car will require 3 tune-ups in a 30-day period."
"To determine the total hours Bruce works over the three days, we need to calculate his work hours for each day and then sum them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours. 

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours by adding up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the amount of allowance each girl received, we must first calculate the total amount spent on the birthday surprise. The cost of the cake is $11. The cost of 1 dozen balloons, which is equivalent to 12 balloons, can be calculated by determining the cost of 2 balloons and then multiplying it by 6 (12 / 2 = 6). Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons cost 6 * $0.5 = $3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost of the birthday surprise is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28. Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to purchase these items, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find the amount each girl received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira purchased, we must first calculate the sum of the individual quantities of each type of fruit. 

The number of apples is 3, the number of bananas is 5, and the number of oranges is 6. 

Therefore, the total number of fruits is 3 + 5 + 6 = 14.

However, Lola consumed 2 pieces of the fruit. To find the remaining quantity, we must subtract the number of fruits consumed from the total number of fruits purchased.

14 - 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the total number of students, we must calculate the number of students participating in each sport and then sum these values.

The number of students playing tennis is 6. 

The number of students playing volleyball is twice the number playing tennis, which is 2 * 6 = 12.

The number of students playing soccer is the sum of boys and girls, which is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students by adding the number of students playing each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To determine the total profit generated from the sale of lollipops, we first need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost incurred.

The total revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of students, the average number of lollipops sold per student, and the price per lollipop. 

Total revenue = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.8/lollipop
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of students, the average number of lollipops sold per student, and the cost per lollipop.

Total cost = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.5/lollipop
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

The total profit is then obtained by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $240 - $150
Total profit = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we must first establish the number of each type of pet. 

Larry has 3 cats. 

Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, the number of dogs is 3 * 3 = 9.

The number of rabbits is 2 fewer than the number of dogs, which is 9 - 2 = 7.

The number of fish in the fish tank is three times the number of rabbits, so it is 3 * 7 = 21.

The number of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish, which is 21 / 3 = 7.

To find the total number of pets, we sum the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To determine the duration for which the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the combined daily consumption of Abby and Josh. Abby consumes 2 slices per day, while Josh consumes twice as much, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices per day.

Their combined daily consumption is 2 + 4 = 6 slices. 

To find the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by their combined daily consumption: 24 / 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To determine the total number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Martha started collecting shells at the age of 5, and by her 10th birthday, she has been collecting for 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of months by multiplying the number of years by 12. 

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

As Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells collected is equal to the total number of months.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups of tea into 3 equal rows, we can calculate the number of cups in each row by dividing the total number of cups by the number of rows.

Number of cups in each row = Total number of cups / Number of rows
= 27 / 3
= 9 cups

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is half the number of cups in each row.

Number of mint tea cups in each row = Number of cups in each row / 2
= 9 / 2
= 4.5 cups

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we must consider the context of the problem. If there are 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, resulting in a total of 3 * 4 = 12 mint tea cups. On the other hand, if there are 5 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, resulting in a total of 3 * 5 = 15 mint tea cups.

Given that the total number of mint tea cups is 15, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we first need to calculate the total number of trips he can make within the given time frame. Given that each round trip takes 4 hours, in 8 hours, the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Since the sloth aims to collect a total of 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips, we can calculate the minimum number of berries he needs to collect per trip by dividing the total number of berries by the number of trips: 24 / 2 = 12 berries per trip.

Therefore, the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first calculate the initial amount of water transferred to the tank. Given that the pool contains 10,000 gallons of water and the tank is filled with half of this amount, the initial water in the tank is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons.

Next, we calculate the total water used from the tank over a period of 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so the total water used in 6 days is 500 * 6 = 3,000 gallons.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount: 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine the number of movies Colby can see, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent. 

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we must first calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then sum them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Given that Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Similarly, a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are therefore 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{85000}$"
"To determine the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we must first calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the course of the week. 

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which equates to 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs on each of these days. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is the sum of the Junebugs removed each day: 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300.

There are 5 days in total. To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60.

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 60."
"To determine the distance each vehicle traveled, we can utilize the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. 

For the bus, traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, the distance traveled is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

Similarly, for the car, traveling at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, the distance traveled is 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we need to calculate the total number of toys Sophie had before purchasing the bouncy balls and then subtract this value from the total number of toys after the purchase.

The total number of toys before the purchase consists of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Number of blocks = 31
Number of stuffed animals = 8
Number of stacking rings = 9

Total number of toys before purchase = 31 + 8 + 9
= 48

The total number of toys after the purchase is given as 62. 

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after purchase - Total number of toys before purchase
= 62 - 48

"To find Peter's age, we can start by expressing the given information in a system of equations. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following relationships:
1. P + Pp + J = 100
2. Pp = J + 10
3. P = Pp + J

From equation 2, we can substitute Pp with J + 10 in equation 1:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P with Pp + J in the equation P + 2J + 10 = 100:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total number of water balloons, we first calculate the initial number of balloons. Maria, the host, has 1 water balloon, and each of her 4 friends has 2 balloons. Therefore, the initial number of balloons is the sum of Maria's balloon and her friends' balloons, which is 1 + 4 * 2 = 9.

Next, Maria's mom gives each person 3 additional balloons. Since there are 5 individuals (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

To find the total number of balloons, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of tables required for the charity yard sale, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of items available. 

The charity group receives 10 boxes from each of the 10 people who donate, resulting in a total of 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. Additionally, they already possess 10 boxes, bringing the total number of boxes to 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Given that each table can accommodate 2 boxes, the total number of tables needed is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, the charity group already owns 15 tables. Therefore, they require 30 - 15 = 15 additional tables.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the average total distance spat, we must first calculate the total distance spat by each participant. Zoey's watermelon contains 40 seeds, each of which she spits 10 feet. Therefore, her total distance is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Similarly, Sydney's watermelon contains 35 seeds, each of which she spits 12 feet. Consequently, her total distance is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both participants is the sum of their individual distances, which is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the total number of seeds spat. Since Zoey spits 40 seeds and Sydney spits 35 seeds, the total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

Therefore, the average total distance spat is 820 feet / 75 seeds = 10.93 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10.93}$"
"To determine the difference in revenue between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, we must first calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. 

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour. Given that each machine operates for 24 hours a day and 30 days in a month, we can calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine as follows:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, we calculate the total revenue generated by each machine, assuming each widget sells for $6.

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue generated by the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue generated by the Widgeteer 3000:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we first need to calculate the total hours he spends at the hotel. He checks in at 5 pm and checks out at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

The hotel offers a 24-hour stay for 1600 pesos, but Cameron chooses to pay for a 12-hour stay and add 70 pesos for every additional hour. The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos, and since he stays for 5 additional hours, he needs to pay 70 * 5 = 350 pesos for the extra time.

Therefore, the total cost for Cameron's stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find the amount Cameron saves, we compare this to the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To determine the total amount of hay required, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat requires 5 pounds of hay, and each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can express the amount each sheep needs as 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately. For the goats, the total amount of hay required is 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds. For the sheep, the total amount of hay required is 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay required for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To determine the number of 25 dollar pens John can purchase after accounting for his expenses, we must first calculate his total earnings and then subtract the costs associated with gas and pencils.

John's hourly wage is 50 dollars, and he worked for 6 hours, yielding a total earnings of 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

Next, we subtract the cost of gas, which is 50 dollars, and the deposit of 100 dollars from his earnings. This leaves him with 300 - 50 - 100 = 150 dollars.

Following this, we calculate the cost of the pencils, which is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. Subtracting this from his remaining balance, we find that he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

Finally, we divide the remaining balance by the cost of each pen to determine the number of pens he can purchase: 100 / 25 = 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is 4."
"To determine the total number of letters in the words Craig and his brother have spelled, we first calculate the total number of letters in the words Craig has spelled. Since Craig has spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, the total number of letters is given by the product of these two quantities: 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother has spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is the sum of the total number of letters in the words Craig and his brother have spelled: 300 + 350 = 650.

"To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we need to calculate the total number of positions available for the children. Since there are 8 children in each row and there are 7 rows for each of the 5 different schools, we can find the total number of children by multiplying the number of children in each row by the number of rows and then by the number of schools.

The calculation is as follows:

Total number of children = (Number of children in each row) * (Number of rows) * (Number of schools)
Total number of children = 8 * 7 * 5
Total number of children = 280

Therefore, the total number of children participating in the drill is 280."
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. Since there are 29 pupils in the class and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

Next, we calculate the total number of bottles the teacher receives by redeeming her 9 coupons, each of which is redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles she receives is 9 * 100 = 900.

To find the number of bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she received. This yields 900 - 58 = 842.

"To determine the total amount charged by Patty's Plumbing, we must first calculate the labor cost, which is based on the time spent on the job. Given that the job took 2.25 hours and the labor rate is $35 per hour, we can calculate the labor cost as follows:

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour
Labor cost = $78.75

In addition to the labor cost, we must also consider the cost of parts, which is $60. Furthermore, there is a visit fee of $40.

To find the total amount charged, we can sum these three components:

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

Therefore, the total amount charged by Patty's Plumbing is $178.75.

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To determine the amount James was out, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs after the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs is $150. To find the price after a 40% discount, we calculate 40% of $150 and subtract it from the original price.

Discount = 0.4 * $150 = $60
Price after discount = $150 - $60 = $90

James then sold 5 CDs for $40 each, resulting in a total revenue of $200. 

To find the net loss, we subtract the cost of the CDs from the revenue: $200 - $90 = $110.

Therefore, James was out $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total earnings from Jen's root crops, we need to calculate the revenue generated from each type of crop and then sum these values.

"To determine the time it took James to swim across the lake, we first need to calculate the time it took him to swim 60% of the distance. The distance is 20 miles, and 60% of this distance is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

Given that James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is calculated as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After completing this portion of the swim, James rests for half the duration of the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we first need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread, we can express this as 7 * 70.

Performing the multiplication, we find that 7 * 70 equals 490. 

However, the bakery has 40 fewer loaves than this amount. To find the actual number of loaves the bakery has, we subtract 40 from 490.

490 - 40 = 450

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To determine the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times. The formula for commission is given by:

Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100

For the New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%

Commission = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
Commission = 300 / 100
Commission = $3

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%

Commission = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
Commission = 1200 / 100
Commission = $12

Now, we can find the total commission by adding the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal:
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine Leo's age, we can establish a relationship between the ages of the three individuals. Let's denote Leo's age as L, Marcus's age as M, and Deanna's age as D.

We are given that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26. We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, which implies M = D - 5. Substituting the value of D, we get M = 26 - 5 = 21.

Furthermore, it is stated that Marcus is half of Leo's age, which can be expressed as M = 0.5L. Substituting the value of M, we get 21 = 0.5L.

To find Leo's age, we can solve for L by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in 2 * 21 = L, which simplifies to L = 42.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

The final answer is: 42"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, which is 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. This gives us the following equations:

B = A + 20
B = D + 10

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so we can write the equation:

B + A + D = 45

Substituting B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45, we get:

(A + 20) + A + D = 45

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2A + D + 20 = 45

Substituting B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45, we get:

(D + 10) + A + D = 45

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2D + A + 10 = 45

Now we have two equations:

2A + D + 20 = 45
2D + A + 10 = 45

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate A:

(2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45

Simplifying this equation, we get:

A - D + 10 = 0

Rearranging the equation, we get:

A - D = -10

Adding D to both sides, we get:

A = D - 10

Substituting A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20, we get:

B = (D - 10) + 20

Simplifying this equation, we get:

B = D + 10

Substituting B = D + 10 into the equation B = A + 20, we get:

D + 10 = A + 20

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

D = A + 10

Now we have A = D - 10 and D = A + 10. We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation A = D - 10 to get:

A = (A + 10) - 10

Simplifying this equation, we get:

A = A

This is a true statement, but it doesn't provide any new information. We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation 2A + D + 20 = 45 to get:

2A + (A + 10) + 20 = 45

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3A + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:

3A = 15

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

A = 5

Now that we know A = 5, we can substitute A = 5 into the equation B = A + 20 to get:

B = 5 + 20

Simplifying this equation, we get:

B = 25

However, the question asks for the number of points Azibo scored, which is A.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we must first consider the printing density of the paper. Given that each paper is printed on both sides, the effective number of pages per inch is twice the number of pages per inch when considering a single side. 

Since there are 100 pages to the inch when considering a single side, the effective number of pages per inch when both sides are considered is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book by multiplying the effective number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches. The book is 1.5 inches thick, so the total number of pages in the book is 200 * 1.5 = 300 pages.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we first need to calculate the total duration of his work in minutes. Given that he worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, we can find the total hours worked and then convert it to minutes.

The time difference between 8:00 AM and 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes worked by multiplying the number of hours by 60:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to determine the number of 15-minute intervals within the total minutes worked. This can be calculated by dividing the total minutes worked by 15:
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can find the total number of reports stapled by multiplying the number of reports stapled per interval by the number of intervals:
30 reports/interval * 60 intervals = 1800 reports

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"To determine the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate her total sleep duration and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim's usual sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, her usual sleep duration is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her actual wake-up time is 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

We know that she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

The final answer is: 457"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to establish the initial number of measuring spoons he possesses. Given that he has two dozen measuring cups, we calculate the total number of cups by multiplying 2 by 12.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the initial number of spoons by multiplying the number of cups by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

Following this, we need to account for the 6 measuring spoons Jonathan gifted to Pedro. To find the remaining number of spoons, we subtract 6 from the initial number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds. Given that 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we can find this by multiplying 1000 by 1/5.

1000 * (1/5) = 200

Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied. We can find this by multiplying 1000 by 4/5.

1000 * (4/5) = 800

Next, we need to calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we can find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks by multiplying 50 by 14 (the number of days in 2 weeks).

50 * 14 = 700

Now, we add the initial number of occupied beds to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks to find the total number of occupied beds.

200 + 700 = 900

Finally, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

1000 - 900 = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to calculate the number of non-work emails. Since she sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work-related, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Next, we find the number of emails to family, which is two-thirds of the non-work emails. This can be calculated as (2/3) * 9 = 6. Therefore, 6 emails are sent to family.

The remaining non-work emails are 9 - 6 = 3. To find the number of emails sent to her boyfriend, we calculate one-third of these remaining emails, which is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Thus, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we can establish a series of relationships between the individuals' ages.

Let's denote Aliya's age as A, Shawna's age as S, and Shawna's father's age as F. We are given the following information:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, which can be expressed as F = 5S.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, which can be expressed as S = 3A.
3. Aliya is 3 years old, so A = 3.

Substituting the value of A into the equation S = 3A, we get S = 3 * 3 = 9. This means Shawna is 9 years old.

Now, substituting the value of S into the equation F = 5S, we get F = 5 * 9 = 45. Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the percentage of the reported number that represents the actual attendance. Since Kelly stated that Courtney overestimated the number of people in attendance by 20%, we can express this as 100% - 20% = 80% of the actual attendance.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as 'x'. We know that 80% of 'x' is equal to the number reported by Courtney, which is 48. We can express this as an equation:

0.80x = 48

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.80:

x = 48 / 0.80
x = 60

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the total number of balls the coach brought to practice, we can establish a relationship between the number of balls carried by each of the three boys. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Similarly, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2x = 4x balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them, which is x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried 2x balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the equation 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x
Total number of balls = 7 * 1
Total number of balls = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we first need to establish the total number of holes at the end of the first day. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.

On the second day, they dug 13 holes, resulting in a total of 10 + 13 = 23 holes at the end of the second day.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, leading to a total of 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes at the end of the third day.

Given that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, we can calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day as 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of corn chips Amora, Lainey, and Collins received. Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey received as x. Since Collins received 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins received x + 15 corn chips.

Given that Amora and Lainey received 70 corn chips each, we can equate x to 70. Therefore, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we can sum the number of corn chips each person received:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15
Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To determine the cost of travel, we must first calculate 50% of the cost of supplies. This can be achieved by multiplying the cost of supplies by 0.5. Given that the cost of supplies is $400, we have:

50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200

Next, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel:

$400 + $200 = $600

Therefore, the cost of travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of PokÃ©mon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

We know that the total number of PokÃ©mon caught by the three is 339, so we can write the equation A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more PokÃ©mon than Stan, which can be expressed as L = S + 5.

Furthermore, we are given that Stan has caught 13 fewer PokÃ©mon than four times the number caught by Adelwolfe, which can be written as S = 4A - 13.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to eliminate L: A + (S + 5) + S = 339, which simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Substituting the third equation into the previous one yields A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

Expanding the equation gives A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combining like terms results in 9A - 21 = 339.

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation gives 9A = 360.

Dividing both sides by 9 yields A = 40.

Now that we know the value of A, we can find S by substituting A into the equation S = 4A - 13: S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 PokÃ©mon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we first need to establish the number of episodes. Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the number of episodes as follows:

Number of episodes = 20 minutes per episode / 2
Number of episodes = 20 / 2
Number of episodes = 10 episodes

Now, to find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total time = Number of episodes * Length of each episode
Total time = 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode
Total time = 200 minutes

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we must calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, we calculate the distance traveled in the first 10 hours of flight in the southerly direction: 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles. 

Next, we calculate the distance traveled in the last 5 hours of flight in the southerly direction: 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Then, we calculate the distance traveled in the 2 hours of flight in the northerly direction: 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Since the bird traveled 36 miles north, we must subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to find the net distance between the two homes.

Net distance = Distance traveled in the first 10 hours + Distance traveled in the last 5 hours - Distance traveled in the 2 hours
Net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta received. She made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is equivalent to 12 brownies. Additionally, she received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is equivalent to 6 brownies. Furthermore, her friends provided 4 dozen brownies, which is equivalent to 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

Next, we need to calculate the number of brownies eaten during the party. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were consumed, which is equivalent to 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, we can determine the total number of brownies left over by subtracting the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received.

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total age of the family members, we first need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which can be expressed as 0.75 times his age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75.

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for synthetic gut racquets. There are 3 racquets to be strung with synthetic gut, and it takes an average of 15 minutes to string each one. Therefore, the total time for synthetic gut racquets is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

Next, we'll calculate the time for polyester string racquets. There are 5 racquets to be strung with polyester string, and it takes an average of 22 minutes to string each one. Therefore, the total time for polyester string racquets is 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

Lastly, we'll calculate the time for hybrid racquets. There are 4 racquets to be strung with a hybrid set, and it takes an average of 18 minutes to string each one. Therefore, the total time for hybrid racquets is 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time by adding the time for each type of string together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To determine the total cost of the phones, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first two phones are priced at $600 each, resulting in a total cost of 2 * $600 = $1200. 

For the remaining two phones, the price is halved to $300 each. Therefore, the total cost for these phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Combining the costs of the first two phones and the remaining two phones, we get a total cost of $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To determine the total number of players in both teams, we first need to establish the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team.

The number of players on Zeke's team is 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team.

The total number of players in both teams is 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"To determine the total number of wooden slats required for the fence, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2 * (L + W), where L represents the length and W represents the width.

Given that the length of the garden is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2 * (15 + 10)
P = 2 * 25
P = 50 feet

Since Robert requires 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we can calculate the total number of slats needed by multiplying the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = P * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges she had initially. Since she bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges she gave away to her mom and sister. She gave each of them 2 boxes, so the total number of boxes given away is 2 + 2 = 4. 

Now, we subtract the number of boxes given away from the total number of boxes to find the number of boxes she had left: 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the total number of states in both the United States and India, we first need to establish the number of states in each country. The United States has a well-documented 50 states.

India, on the other hand, has a number of states that is 4 more than half the number of states in the United States. To calculate this, we find half of 50, which is 25, and then add 4 to that result, yielding 29.

Therefore, India has 29 states.

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the United States to the number of states in India: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine the number of hours Tyler must work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

The total cost of the items is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he must work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Tyler must work for 5 hours to afford the books."
"To determine the number of cherries Jerry has, we first need to find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's share by subtracting 10 from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract 50 from 60: 60 - 50 = 10.

Given that Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, we can calculate the difference in their shares by subtracting Jerry's total from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total earnings from the fundraiser, we need to calculate the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both Saturday and Sunday, and then multiply these quantities by their respective prices.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G. We are given that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Let's denote the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday as A. Then, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is A - 4.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

We are also given that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. Therefore, A = 15.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday. 
A - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (G * 6) + (A - 4 * 15) = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (G + 5 * 6) + (A * 15) = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: $\boxed{540}$"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need for her 8-day vacation, we must first calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use. Given that she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day.

Over the course of 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, resulting in a total of 4 * 8 = 32 applications.

Each application requires 1 ounce of sunscreen, so the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 32 ounces.

Since each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces, we can calculate the number of bottles needed by dividing the total amount of sunscreen used (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 / 8 = 4

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the cost of both the red and blue cars, we first need to calculate the price of the red car, which is 40% cheaper than the blue car.

Given that the price of the blue car is $100, we can find the discount by multiplying the price of the blue car by the discount percentage (40% or 0.4). This yields a discount of $40.

The price of the red car is then obtained by subtracting the discount from the price of the blue car: $100 - $40 = $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we simply add the prices of the red and blue cars: $100 + $60 = $160.

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the current ages of Emil's dad and brother as variables. Let's denote the current age of Emil's dad as D and the current age of his brother as B.

We are given that Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, which can be expressed as:

24 = (D + 5) / 2

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 2:

48 = D + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:

43 = D

Now, we are also given that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This can be expressed as:

24 = 2(B + 5)

Simplifying this equation by subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

14 = B

Now that we have the current ages of Emil's dad and brother, we can find the sum of their ages:

D + B = 43 + 7 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads given by her mother, sister, and friend, and then sum these values.

Her mother gave her 20 beads. 
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we must calculate the amount he caught each day and sum them together. 

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we first need to calculate the number of football players in the class. Given that 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 30 students = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we need to find the number of students who are not football players. This is given by subtracting the number of football players from the total number of students:

30 students - 6 students = 24 students.

Now, we need to calculate the number of cheerleaders or band members. Given that 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or band members, we can calculate this as follows:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members:

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie, we first need to establish their individual shoe sizes. Given that Sophie's shoe size is 5, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as five times that of Sophie's, which yields 25.

The sum of their shoe sizes is then 5 + 25 = 30. To find the average, we divide this sum by 2, resulting in 30 / 2 = 15.

Therefore, the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost Pat will incur to fill her flower bed, we must first calculate the number of plants she can accommodate. The flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant requires 1.5 feet of space between it and its neighbors, as well as its own width of 1 foot. 

Converting the length of the flower bed to inches, we have 111 * 12 = 1332 inches. The total space required for each plant, including the space between it and its neighbors, is 12 inches (plant width) + 18 inches (space between plants) = 30 inches.

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 30n.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to purchase 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n. Adding 30n to both sides, we get 42n = 1320. Dividing both sides by 42, we find n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother consumes in a week, we first need to calculate his daily consumption. Since he eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels per day, we can find Edgar's brother's daily consumption by dividing 18 by 2.

Edgar's brother's daily consumption = 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels

Next, we need to calculate the total number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply his daily consumption by 7.

Total pretzels in a week = 9 * 7 = 63

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we must first calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately, and then sum these values.

The cost of the petunias can be calculated as follows: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00.

Similarly, the cost of the sweet potato vines is: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost is then the sum of the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses that can be planted, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

The 4 sunflowers require 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil, and the 10 carnations require 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil. Therefore, the total amount of soil used for these flowers is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Given that the total amount of soil available is 30 pounds, the amount of soil remaining for the roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can purchase in a year, we first need to calculate her monthly savings. Given that she sets aside 25% of her monthly income, we can calculate this as follows:

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Next, we need to find the total amount she saves in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate this as:

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we can determine the number of pairs of shoes she can purchase in a year by dividing her total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, the correct answer is:

6"
"To determine the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider the time required for both tasks simultaneously.

First, let's calculate the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Given that she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can sautÃ© 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to cook 90 shrimp is 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which equals 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are performed concurrently, we need to determine the maximum time between the two tasks. In this scenario, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 30 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. The total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. The total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine Bill's age when he first saw the comet, we need to establish the relationship between the ages of Bill and his father at the time of the comet's appearance.

Let's denote the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet as 'x'. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years. 

When Bill saw the comet for the second time, his age was three times the age of his father when he saw the comet, which is 3x. 

We know that the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years, and Bill's age at the second sighting is 3x. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3x - x = 75, which simplifies to 2x = 75.

Solving for x, we get x = 75 / 2 = 37.5. This is the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet.

Since the comet appears every 75 years, Bill's father was 37.5 years old when Bill was born. 

To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we subtract 75 years from the age at which he saw it for the second time. However, we need to find Bill's age at the second sighting. We know that Bill's age at the second sighting is 3x, and x = 37.5. 

Bill's age at the second sighting is 3 * 37.5 = 112.5 years old.

Now, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from his age at the second sighting: 112.5 - 75 = 37.5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{37.5}$"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we must consider the frequency of each type of check. 

Buford writes a check for his electric bill once per month, resulting in 12 checks per year. Similarly, he writes a check for his gas bill once per month, also yielding 12 checks per year. 

In addition, he writes two checks to the church every month, which translates to 24 checks per year. 

Lastly, Buford writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, meaning he writes 4 checks per year.

To find the total number of checks, we sum the checks from each category: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To determine the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we need to first calculate the total number of flights it makes in a day. Let's denote this as x. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can express this relationship as x = 2 * 44.

Solving for x, we get x = 88. This means the first plane makes a total of 88 flights in a day.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we must first calculate the individual howling times.

Tobias's howl lasts for 20 seconds. Chikote's howl is twice as long as Tobias's, so Chikote's howl lasts for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous's howl lasts for the combined duration of Tobias's and Chikote's howls, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we sum the individual howling times: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we can calculate the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To solve this problem, we can start by expressing the total age of the children as the sum of their individual ages. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. The total age of the children is given as 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro.

The total age of the children can be expressed as: 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

We are also given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

We can simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
3 + 4 + (7 + W) + W = 20
12 + 2W = 20
2W = 8
W = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

However, the lawyer's contribution is based on the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, excluding the $200 donated by Walter's friend. Therefore, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 remains $2000.

The lawyer will donate 3 times this amount, which is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To determine the number of people in the church next door, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies available. Given that each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride then decided to donate half of the cookies to the church. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Since each person in the church received 15 cookies, we can calculate the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies per person.

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, let's consider the total watermelon as a unit of 100. 

Let's denote the amount of watermelon each kid gets as x. Since each adult receives twice as much as each kid, the amount each adult gets is 2x.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each), and the total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Given that the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combining like terms, we get 6x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{33.33}$"
"To determine the time Doctor Jones has available to update his records, we must first calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments. 

The time spent on rounds can be calculated by multiplying the number of inpatients by the time spent per inpatient: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes. 

Similarly, the time spent on appointments is found by multiplying the number of appointments by the time spent per appointment: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes.

The total time spent on rounds and appointments is the sum of these two values: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

To convert this total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Since Doctor Jones works a total of 9 hours, we can find the time available for updating his records by subtracting the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we must first calculate the total time required to complete the process. This involves summing the time needed for making the cake batter, baking the cake, cooling the cake, and frosting the cake.

The time required for making the cake batter is 20 minutes, baking the cake is 30 minutes, cooling the cake is 2 hours (120 minutes), and frosting the cake is 10 minutes. 

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time from minutes to hours, we get 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required from the desired serving time to find the latest start time. 

Latest start time = 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we must first calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session. The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, resulting in 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings per month by multiplying the total cost per session by the number of sessions in a month: $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter, with a total of 64 chocolate bars and 4 boxes, the number of chocolate bars per box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Similarly, for Martha, with a total of 56 chocolate bars and 7 boxes, the number of chocolate bars per box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the population of porcupines in the park after a year, we first need to calculate the number of female porcupines. Given that the total population is 50 and the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the cost of filling the swimming pool, we must first calculate the volume of the pool. Given that the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth in this case).

First, we calculate the volume of the pool:
V = lwh
V = 14 * 25 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. Since 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons, we can multiply the volume by this conversion factor:
Volume (gallons) = V * 7.48
Volume (gallons) = 1400 * 7.48
Volume (gallons) = 10472 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the total cost to fill the pool. The pool company charges $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the volume in gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = Volume (gallons) * cost per gallon
Cost = 10472 * 0.10
Cost = 1047.2

The final answer is: $1047.20"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we first need to establish the quantities of each color. We are given that there are 9 red sticks. Additionally, we know that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

Furthermore, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, which is 14. Consequently, the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

To find the total number of sticks, we sum the quantities of each color: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the difference in the distances traveled by Matteo and Shandy, we first calculate the distance each individual covered.

Matteo's distance can be calculated as the product of his speed and the duration of his travel: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

Similarly, Shandy's distance is the product of his speed and the duration of his travel: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

The difference in their distances is then obtained by subtracting Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is: $\boxed{230}$"
"To determine the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we note that the school has a total of 3000 students. We are given that half of these students are over 16 years old, which implies that the remaining half are under 16 years old. Therefore, the number of students over 16 is 3000 / 2 = 1500, and the number of students under 16 is also 1500.

Next, we are informed that one-fourth of the students over 16 are male. This means that the number of male students over 16 is 1500 / 4 = 375. Consequently, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Furthermore, we are told that one-half of the students under 16 are male. This implies that the number of male students under 16 is 1500 / 2 = 750. Therefore, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and the number of female students under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of laps each individual can run, we need to establish the relative performance of each person based on the given information.

Bethany's performance is a baseline, with 10 laps in one hour. Trey's performance is 4 laps greater than Bethany's, resulting in 14 laps. Shaelyn's performance is half of Trey's, which is 7 laps. Quinn's performance is 2 laps less than Shaelyn's, resulting in 5 laps.

To find the difference in performance between Bethany and Quinn, we subtract Quinn's performance from Bethany's performance: 10 - 5 = 5 laps.

Therefore, the difference in the number of laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn is 5 laps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

The amount of water remaining in the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to model the charge of the power bank over time. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% over the last 3 hours. To find the charge remaining after 8 hours, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the charge remaining after 8 hours is y. Then, the charge lost in the last 3 hours is y - 28%. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

So, we can set up the equation: y - 28% = 6%.

Solving for y, we get y = 34%.

Now, we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%. We also know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%. To find the initial charge, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the first 5 hours.

The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 34% = 21%.

So, we can set up the equation: x - 21% = 55% is incorrect, we need to set up the equation x - (9% * 5) = 55% to find the initial charge.

x - (9% * 5) = 55%
x - 45% = 55%
x = 100%

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 100%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15, resulting in a total hourly earnings of $25.

Given that she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

Total weekly earnings = Hourly earnings * Number of hours worked per week
= $25 * 40
= $1000

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. This can be calculated as:

Down payment = 20% of $10,000
= 0.2 * $10,000
= $2000

Now, we can determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment by dividing the amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

Number of weeks = Down payment / Total weekly earnings
= $2000 / $1000
= 2

Therefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can purchase, we must first calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already acquired. 

The cost of 3 peaches at $0.5 each is 3 * $0.5 = $1.5. 
The cost of 4 pears at $0.5 each is 4 * $0.5 = $2. 
The cost of 2 kiwis at $1 each is 2 * $1 = $2. 
The cost of 5 apples at $0.75 each is 5 * $0.75 = $3.75.

The total cost of the fruits he has already purchased is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25.

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

To find out how many plums he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of sweets each friend received, we first need to calculate the total number of packs given away by Anne. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of packs given away is 15 - 2 = 13.

Now, we divide the total number of packs given away by the number of friends to find out how many packs each friend received. This is calculated as 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we can find the total number of pieces in 1.3 packs by multiplying 1.3 by 60. However, we must consider that 1.3 packs can be broken down into 1 whole pack and 0.3 packs. 

1 pack contains 60 pieces, and 0.3 packs contain 0.3 * 60 = 18 pieces. Therefore, each friend received 60 + 18 = 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the price of carrots after three years, we can utilize the concept of exponential growth, which is applicable in this scenario due to the annual 5% increase in price. The formula for exponential growth is given by:

P(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^t

where P(t) is the price at time t, P0 is the initial price, r is the annual growth rate, and t is the number of years.

Given that the initial price (P0) is $120, the annual growth rate (r) is 5% or 0.05, and the time period (t) is 3 years, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P(3) = 120 * (1 + 0.05)^3
P(3) = 120 * (1.05)^3
P(3) = 120 * 1.157625
P(3) = 139.145

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we first need to calculate the number of pictures in each album. Given that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and distributed them evenly across 8 albums, we can find the number of pictures per album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Since 3 albums were dedicated to selfies, the total number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums = 5 albums. 
The number of portraits is 5 albums * 9 pictures per album = 45 portraits.

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies is 27 selfies + 45 portraits = 72.

The final answer is: 72"
"To determine the total time James spends reading, we need to calculate the number of sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set.

Given that James reads 18 pages in total, we can find the number of sets by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages per set: 18 pages / 3 pages/set = 6 sets.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we can find the total time spent reading by multiplying the number of sets by the time per set: 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to consider the changes in the number of guests throughout the day.

Initially, the hotel was completely booked with 100 guests. 

24 guests elected an early checkout, resulting in a decrease of 24 guests. This leaves 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, further reducing the number of guests to 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. This increase in guests brings the total to 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, resulting in a total of 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we need to calculate the bananas he picked on each day and then sum them up.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas. 
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas. 
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas he picked on each day: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

Therefore, the total number of bananas John has is 22."
"To determine the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz, and then find out how many of each she is sure to get.

First, let's find the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:
- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36
- Average questions: 36 / 2 = 18
- Difficult questions: 36 / 2 = 18

Next, we'll calculate the number of each type of question Aries is sure to get:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9

Now, we'll add up the number of questions Aries is sure to get:
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of small and large stuffed animals sold. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'. Given that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, we can express this relationship as x = 2y.

Next, we need to consider the pricing of the stuffed animals. The price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, which is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. This can be expressed as 4x + 12y = 120.

Substituting x = 2y into the equation 4x + 12y = 120, we get 4(2y) + 12y = 120. Simplifying this equation, we have 8y + 12y = 120, which further simplifies to 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20, yielding y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2, resulting in x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches the family consumes in one week, we must first calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

The family's daily consumption can be calculated by summing the individual daily consumption of each family member. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total daily consumption is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7. Thus, the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week is 11 * 7 = 77 sandwiches.

The final answer is: 77"
"To determine the amount of money Suzanne has left from her earnings, we need to calculate her total revenue and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her revenue from selling cookies. Since she sold 80 cookies at $1 each, her revenue from cookies is 80 * $1 = $80.

Next, we calculate her revenue from selling cupcakes. With 60 cupcakes sold at $4 each, her revenue from cupcakes is 60 * $4 = $240.

Now, we add her revenue from cookies and cupcakes to find her total revenue: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount she gave away is 2 * $10 = $20.

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total revenue: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we can calculate the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins and subtract this value from the total number of eggs, then subtract the remaining unfound eggs.

The total number of eggs is 100. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 60 eggs. There are 10 eggs that remain unfound.

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days, we must first establish the daily ore extraction rate for a single dwarf using a steel pickaxe.

Given that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, and his rate increases by a factor of two when using an iron pickaxe, we can infer that his daily ore extraction rate with an iron pickaxe is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds.

Furthermore, we are informed that the steel pickaxe enables the dwarf to mine 50% more ore than the iron pickaxe. To calculate this increase, we find 50% of 24 pounds, which is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. Consequently, the daily ore extraction rate with a steel pickaxe is 24 + 12 = 36 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total daily ore extraction rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes by multiplying the individual rate by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

To find the total ore extracted over a 30-day period, we multiply the daily rate by the number of days: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

Therefore, the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days is 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43200}$"
"To determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can establish a proportionality relationship between the given prices and the corresponding number of sandwiches. 

Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x. We know that the price of the first package with 2 sandwiches is $3, and the price of the second package with 4 sandwiches is $6. 

Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for each package. The ratio for the first package is 3/2 and for the second package is 6/4, which simplifies to 3/2. 

Given that the ratios are equal, we can set up a proportion to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches: 3/2 = 6/4 = x/8. 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 3 * 8 = 6 * 2, which simplifies to 24 = 12. However, this is not the correct approach. Instead, we should find the price per sandwich for the second package and then multiply it by the number of sandwiches in the third package.

The price per sandwich for the second package is 6/4 = 1.5. Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: 1.5 * 8 = 12.

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the monthly payment for the bedroom set, we first need to calculate the remaining balance after Tom sells his old bedroom set for $1000. The total cost of the bedroom set is $3000, so the remaining balance is:

$3000 - $1000 = $2000

Next, we need to calculate the monthly payment, which is 10% of the remaining balance. To find 10% of a value, we multiply the value by 0.10. Therefore, the monthly payment is:

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we must consider the sequence of events that affected the total count.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst due to a gust of wind. This results in the loss of 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons, leaving 15 red balloons.

Next, the sudden sound startled Sally, causing her to release half of the yellow balloons. This results in the release of 1/2 * 12 = 6 yellow balloons, leaving 6 yellow balloons.

As Sally approached the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree. She then added 75% of these blue balloons to her remaining clutch. This equates to 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons being added.

To find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we sum the remaining balloons: 15 red, 7 green, 6 yellow, and 6 blue. This yields a total of 34 balloons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

To find the probability of having to turn in his homework, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring. 

The probability of not having to turn in his homework is 102%, but this is not possible. However, we can find the probability of having to turn in his homework by subtracting the sum of the probabilities of the three scenarios from 100%.

"To determine the number of tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to calculate the available seating in the Fine Arts Center after accounting for the reserved seats for graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we can divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we cannot distribute a fraction of a ticket, we will round down to the nearest whole number. However, considering the context of the question, it seems that the remaining tickets are intended for guests. Therefore, each graduate can give 5 tickets to their friends and family.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. We are given that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. This implies that the ratio of large to medium-sized beans is 1:2.

Furthermore, we are told that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. This allows us to establish a ratio between small and medium-sized beans, which is 3:1.

To find the number of small beans equivalent to 75 large beans, we can use the ratio of large to medium-sized beans (1:2) to find the number of medium-sized beans, and then use the ratio of small to medium-sized beans (3:1) to find the number of small beans.

First, we find the number of medium-sized beans: 75 large beans * 2 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Next, we find the number of small beans: 150 medium-sized beans * 3 = 450 small beans.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

The final answer is: $\boxed{450}$"
"To determine Melissa's hourly pay after expenses, we first need to calculate her net earnings. This can be done by subtracting her total expenses from her total earnings. 

Her total earnings are calculated as follows: 3 days * $15 per day = $45. Her total expenses are 3 days * $3 per day = $9. 

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Next, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total: 
Total hours = 6 hours per day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses:
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of intervals between the soda bottles and then multiply this by the time it takes to traverse each interval.

Given that the driveway is 24 feet wide and a bottle of soda is placed every 3 feet, we can find the total number of intervals by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 intervals

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of intervals by the time it takes to traverse each interval:

8 intervals * 5 seconds/interval = 40 seconds

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 40 seconds.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of packs Uncle Franky can make with the two boxes of apples, we first need to calculate the total number of apples he has. Since each box contains 40 apples and he ordered two boxes, the total number of apples is 2 * 40 = 80.

"To determine the time it takes for Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn and then divide that by his new income.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn. This includes the total amount of loans he took and the amount of money he lost by not working while in school. The total amount of loans is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000. The amount of money he lost by not working while in school is $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000. Therefore, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

After college, Jim's income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

"To determine the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

First, let's calculate the amount lost in the first race: -$5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

The number of races is 3.

To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to calculate their current heights. 

Xavier's initial height is given as 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). After growing 3 inches, his new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height is given as 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer. Therefore, his new height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combining like terms, we get: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Simplifying further, we have: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtracting 240 from both sides, we get: 4x = 1680.

Dividing both sides by 4, we find: x = 420.

Therefore, the share of the first person is $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To determine the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is equivalent to 21 days.

Next, we need to convert the fraction 3/8 to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the hours worked per day as follows: 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we can find the total hours worked by multiplying the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

To find the hours worked by each painter, we divide the total hours by the number of painters: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

Therefore, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{47.25}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

To simplify the equation, we can multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive, we can perform a simple subtraction operation. 

First, we identify the total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York, which is approximately 1955 kilometers. Next, we calculate the distance Bernice has already driven, which is 325 kilometers over a period of 4 days.

To find the remaining distance, we subtract the distance driven from the total distance:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance driven
= 1955 - 325
= 1630 kilometers

Therefore, Bernice will still need to drive 1630 kilometers.

"To determine the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them together.

First, let's consider the cost of the tank top, which is $10. 

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the running shorts, which are $5 more than the tank top. Therefore, the cost of the running shorts is $10 + $5 = $15.

The tennis shoes were originally priced at $48 but were on sale for half price. To find the sale price, we divide the original price by 2: $48 / 2 = $24.

The athletic socks cost $8, and Alison had a coupon for $2 off. To find the final cost of the socks, we subtract the coupon value from the original price: $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent by summing the costs of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

"To determine James' annual insurance cost, we first need to calculate the increased cost due to the accident. This can be done by finding 60% of the normal monthly cost and adding it to the normal cost.

The normal monthly cost is $120. To find 60% of this amount, we multiply $120 by 0.6.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Now, we add this increased amount to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost.

Increased monthly cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

"To solve this problem, we can establish a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can express Betsy's time as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms to simplify the equation:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the variable term:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: 58"
"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we must calculate the expenses associated with each service provided.

First, let's consider the cost of the cast, which is a fixed expense of $200.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the 30-minute visit. Given that the doctor charges $300 per hour, we can find the cost of the visit by multiplying the hourly rate by the fraction of the hour that was spent, which is 0.5 (since 30 minutes is half of an hour). Therefore, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is calculated by multiplying the number of pills by the cost per pill. In this case, Hannah received 30 painkillers at a cost of $4 per pill, resulting in a total cost of $4 * 30 = $120.

Lastly, we must consider the cost of parking, which is a minimum of 2 hours at a rate of $6 per hour. Therefore, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we add the costs of the cast, visit, painkillers, and parking together: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate the number of emails he responds to on a daily basis. 

Given that James receives 80 emails per day and 20% of those emails do not require a response, we can calculate the number of emails that do not require a response as follows:

20% of 80 emails = 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails

Consequently, the number of emails that James responds to on a daily basis is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

To find the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the daily number of emails he responds to by 5:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

The final answer is: 320"

"To determine the number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team. 

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and consumed 70% of them. This can be calculated as 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team, on the other hand, ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They consumed 80% of these, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team consumed 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

Therefore, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total cost of postage for Anthony's pizza parlor, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small and big coupons separately and then sum these costs.

First, we calculate the cost of mailing small coupons. The number of small coupons is 700, and each costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we sum the costs of mailing small and big coupons: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To express this in dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of postage for Anthony's pizza parlor is $245.

The final answer is: $245"
"To determine the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained, we first need to calculate the initial number of meatball sub sandwiches ordered by Sidney. This can be found by subtracting 3 from 10.

10 - 3 = 7

Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the initial order is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark then ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches. Sidney subsequently ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, resulting in a total of 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

Now, we need to find the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to calculate the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the trucks were affected, we can find this by multiplying the total number of trucks by 1/4.

Total number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4)
= 20 * 0.25
= 5

Now, we can find the number of trucks that successfully reached the farmers by subtracting the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks.

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = Total number of trucks - Number of trucks with mechanical failures
= 20 - 5
= 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is the product of the number of trucks that reached the farmers and the tons per truck.

Total tons of fertiliser = Number of trucks that reached the farmers * Tons per truck
= 15 * 20
= 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To determine the cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter under the given promotion, we must first understand the terms of the promotion. The store offers a ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off"" deal. This implies that for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, the cost is equivalent to 1.5 pounds at the full price of $4.00 per pound.

Given that Dennis requires 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the total cost by determining the number of 2-pound sets needed. Since 6 pounds is equivalent to 3 sets of 2 pounds, we can proceed as follows:

- The cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter at the full price is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
- The cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter at half off is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
- The total cost for 6 pounds of butter is the sum of these two values, which is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To determine the total cost of the party, we first need to calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20. Kayla invited her 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, totaling 45 individuals. However, 4 guests were unable to attend, leaving 41 guests. Since the initial 20 guests are already accounted for, the number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost per additional guest is $6. Therefore, the cost for the additional guests is 21 * 6 = $126. Adding the initial rental fee of $125, the total cost of the party is $126 + $125 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the amount of money each individual has after spending a portion of their initial funds.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza have as M and R, respectively. We are given that both M and R equal $60.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her initial amount left. Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is (3/4)M = (3/4) * $60 = $45.

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, leaving her with 2/3 of her initial amount. Thus, the amount of money Riza has left is (2/3)R = (2/3) * $60 = $40.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we can add the remaining funds of Maggie and Riza: $45 + $40 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to establish the daily consumption of the first two monkeys. The first monkey consumes 10 bananas daily, while the second monkey consumes 4 more bananas than the first, which equates to 14 bananas per day.

Given that the total number of bananas is 315 and they last for a week, we can calculate the daily consumption by dividing the total number of bananas by 7. This yields 315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, we can calculate the combined daily consumption of the first two monkeys, which is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas. To find the daily consumption of the third monkey, we subtract the combined consumption of the first two monkeys from the total daily consumption: 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

Therefore, the third monkey consumes 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed. 

Teddy completed half of a 500-piece puzzle, which is equivalent to 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 
Then, he completed another 500-piece puzzle, which is 500 pieces. 
So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine the number of quarters Jenny leaves with after purchasing the roses, we first need to calculate the total cost of the flowers. Since 15 roses is equivalent to 1 dozen and 3 individual roses, we can calculate the cost as follows:

1 dozen roses cost $15, and 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. Therefore, the total cost of the roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrives with 5 $5 bills, which amounts to a total of 5 * $5 = $25. To find the change she receives, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only provides change in quarters, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue generated from each item and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the revenue from milkshakes. With 6 milkshakes sold at $5.50 each, the total revenue from milkshakes is 6 * $5.50 = $33.

Next, we calculate the revenue from burger platters. With 9 platters sold at $11 each, the total revenue from platters is 9 * $11 = $99.

Lastly, we calculate the revenue from sodas. With 20 sodas sold at $1.50 each, the total revenue from sodas is 20 * $1.50 = $30.

Now, we sum the revenues from each item to find the total amount of money Terry makes: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

First, let's consider the first train. It arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. Therefore, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of additional weeks Melanie needs to collect 200 toothpicks, we first calculate the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far. Given that she saves 10 toothpicks each week and has been doing so for 12 weeks, the total number of toothpicks saved is:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie requires a total of 200 toothpicks, we can find the number of toothpicks she still needs by subtracting the number she has already saved from the total required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take her to save the remaining toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect the required 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is 0.75 * 2000 = $1500.

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is 1.2 * 1500 = $1800.

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price he paid, which is 2000 - 1800 = $200.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: (200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we first need to calculate the total number of seconds in the given time frame. There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame.

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, and there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72,000.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To determine Frankie's bowling score, we first need to calculate twice Binkie's score. Given that Binkie's score is 90, we can calculate this as 2 * 90 = 180.

Next, we are informed that Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Therefore, we can find Frankie's score by adding 15 to the result of the previous calculation: 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: $\boxed{195}$"
"To determine the total time James spent walking, we must first calculate the total distance he traveled. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back, the total distance is twice the distance to the store, which is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Given that James walks at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk 8 miles by dividing the total distance by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

Therefore, the time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by purchasing bananas in bunches instead of individually, we must first calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in both scenarios.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually is calculated as follows: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas, where each bunch contains 4 bananas. The total number of bananas purchased remains the same, 40. The cost of buying 10 bunches is 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we obtain 2x = 40.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 20.

Therefore, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the rate at which the crocodile grows per year, we can calculate the growth rate by dividing the total growth in inches by the number of years it took to achieve that growth.

Growth rate = Total growth / Number of years
Growth rate = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth rate = 2 inches/year

Now, we can use this growth rate to find the total growth in 13 years by multiplying the growth rate by the number of years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth rate * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's begin by finding the number of each type of bike sold. We know that the total number of bikes sold is 300. Half of them were Trekking bikes, which is 300 / 2 = 150. Additionally, 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, which is 300 * 0.15 = 45. The remaining bikes were MTB, which is 300 - (150 + 45) = 105.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike. The price of a Trekking bike is $450, so the earnings from Trekking bikes are 150 * $450 = $67,500. The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500 / 2 = $250. Therefore, the earnings from BMX bikes are 45 * $250 = $11,250. The earnings from MTB bikes are 105 * $500 = $52,500.

To find the total earnings, we add up the earnings from each type of bike: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we need to consider the production rate of the farmer and the collection rate of the truck. The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, while the truck collects 3 bales per hour.

Given that both the farmer and the truck operate for 6 hours, we can calculate the total production and collection as follows:

- Total production: 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales
- Total collection: 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the total collection from the total production: 30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and the additional minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total minutes John spends in class. There are 6 periods in a normal school day, each lasting 40 minutes. Since John takes 2 extra classes, we need to account for these as well. The total minutes spent in class per day is 6 * 40 + 2 * 40 = 240 + 80 = 320 minutes. Since John attends school 5 days a week, the total minutes spent in class per week is 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes.

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. To find his total weekly minutes, we multiply the minutes in a day by 7: 24 * 60 * 7 = 10080 minutes. Then, we find 1/16 of this total: 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes. Since this is for both Saturday and Sunday, we multiply by 2: 630 * 2 = 1260 minutes.

Now, we add the minutes spent in class and the minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday: 1600 + 1260 = 2860 minutes.

Finally, we convert the total minutes to hours: 2860 / 60 = 47.67 hours.

The final answer is: 47.67"
"To determine the height of the bouncy ball on its second bounce, we must first establish the initial height from which it is dropped. Given that each story in the mall is 24 feet high and Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, after the first bounce, the height of the ball is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we apply the same bounce ratio to the height after the first bounce: 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we must first convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

Finally, the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the total earnings of the apple orchard, we first need to calculate the number of bags of apples sold. Given that each bag contains 10 apples and the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples, we can find the number of bags by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag.

Number of bags = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag.

Total earnings = Number of bags * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To determine the original weight of the triceratops, we can work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate. 

Let's denote the original weight of the triceratops as 'x'. When the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, it consumed x/2 kilograms. The remaining half was then scavenged by the velociraptors, who ate half of this remaining amount, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4 kilograms.

We are given that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which is half of what the velociraptors had. Therefore, the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms. This means that the velociraptors ate x/4 = 540 kilograms.

To find the original weight of the triceratops, we can solve for 'x' by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4: x = 540 * 4 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2160}$"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we must first calculate the total area of the walls. The north and south walls, each measuring 10 feet in width and 8 feet in height, have a combined area of 2 * (10 * 8) = 160 square feet. Similarly, the east and west walls, each measuring 5 feet in width and 8 feet in height, have a combined area of 2 * (5 * 8) = 80 square feet. The total area of the room is therefore 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Given that a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons required to cover the room is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons. Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost of painting the room is 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of her selecting a shaken can from the remaining options.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas, of which 3 were shaken. After taking 1 unshaken soda for herself, there were 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas. Ellen's brother then took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Given that there are now 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken, the probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the ratio of the number of shaken cans to the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 14.29%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.29}$"
"To determine the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

The first train is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, its distance traveled can be calculated as speed multiplied by time, which yields 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train, traveling at half the speed of the first train, has a speed of 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, its distance traveled is 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of their individual distances, which is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the total number of people Billy helps, we first need to calculate the number of days he is available to assist. The period in question spans from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th, resulting in a total of 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off, which is equivalent to 0.2 * 50 = 10 days. Therefore, the number of days he is available to help is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Given that Billy can assist 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, his daily capacity is 2 * 3 = 6 people.

To find the total number of people he helps, we multiply the number of available days by his daily capacity: 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we must first calculate the total number of individuals transported by the buses and the private cars. 

The number of people transported by the buses can be calculated as follows:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Similarly, the number of people transported by the private cars is:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, we can find the total number of people transported by adding the number of people transported by the buses and the private cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can infer that the number of people inside the church is equal to the total number of people transported, assuming that all individuals present were transported.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine Jeff's age, we can establish a series of relationships between the individuals involved. Let's denote Mike's age as M, Martha's age as m, and Jeff's age as j.

Given that Mike is 24 years old, we have M = 24.

We also know that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we can express this as m = M - 4.

Substituting the value of M, we get m = 24 - 4, which simplifies to m = 20.

Lastly, we are told that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so we can express this as j = m + 10.

Substituting the value of m, we get j = 20 + 10, which simplifies to j = 30.

Therefore, Jeff's age is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the time it takes to ride each waterslide, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

For the biggest waterslide, with a length of 300 feet and a speed of 60 feet per minute, the time taken is 300 / 60 = 5 minutes.

For the second biggest waterslide, with a length of 240 feet and a speed of 80 feet per minute, the time taken is 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

The difference in time between the two slides can be calculated by subtracting the time taken for the second biggest slide from the time taken for the biggest slide: 5 - 3 = 2 minutes.

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. 

The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the distance run by Ahito, we first need to calculate the distance run by Micah. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance run by Amber, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we can find the total distance run by Amber and Micah, and subtract this from the total distance run by all three to determine Ahito's distance.

Total distance run by Amber and Micah = 8 + 28
Total distance run by Amber and Micah = 36 miles

Ahito's distance = Total distance - Total distance run by Amber and Micah
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we must first account for the return of the $15.00 item, then calculate the cost of the items she purchased after the return, and finally, add these costs to the initial charge.

The initial charge on Sheila's credit card was $85.00. After returning an item worth $15.00, the new balance is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off its original price of $20.00. The discount is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. Therefore, the price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The set of towels was 10% off its original price of $30.00. The discount is 10% of $30.00, which is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. Therefore, the price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the new purchases is $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00.

Finally, we add the cost of the new purchases to the previous balance to find the new balance on Sheila's credit card: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To determine the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we can start by considering the proportion of jellyfish that change color under UV light. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, and a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/5)x * (1/3) = (1/15)x.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation (1/15)x = 6 to represent this relationship.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15 to isolate x:
(1/15)x * 15 = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine Caroline's age, we can establish a series of relationships between the individuals' ages. Let's denote Chris's age as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A.

Given that Chris is 4 years old, we can express Ben's age in terms of Chris's age as B = 2C. Substituting the known value of C, we find B = 2(4) = 8.

Now, we are given that Caroline is three times older than Ben. This relationship can be expressed as A = 3B. Substituting the known value of B, we find A = 3(8) = 24.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, we must first calculate the total amount she requires for a 20-year retirement period. Given that she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000, her annual retirement income will be 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

The total amount she needs to save for retirement is the product of her annual retirement income and the number of years in retirement, which is $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Next, we calculate the number of years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of 20% of her annual salary, or $20,000 per year. This can be determined by dividing the total savings needed by the annual savings: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save for her retirement.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the length of each final cut, we must first divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into. Given that Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and he must cut it into 4 equal parts, the initial division yields 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm.

Subsequently, each of these 4 equal parts must be further divided into 5 equal parts. Therefore, we divide the result of the initial division by 5, which gives us 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm.

Thus, the length of each final cut will be 5 cm."
"To determine the number of girls in the school, we first need to establish the total population of the school. Given that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys, we can calculate the total population by dividing the number of boys by the decimal equivalent of the percentage of boys.

The decimal equivalent of 40% is 0.4. Therefore, we divide 240 by 0.4 to find the total population: 240 / 0.4 = 600.

Now that we know the total population is 600, we can calculate the number of girls by finding 60% of the total population. The decimal equivalent of 60% is 0.6. Multiplying 0.6 by the total population gives us the number of girls: 0.6 * 600 = 360.

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

"To determine the total amount spent at the gardening shop, we need to calculate the total cost of the items purchased and then subtract the discount applied.

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. To find the total cost before the discount, we add these two amounts together.

Total cost before discount = $19 + $26 = $45

Next, we apply the $7 discount to the total cost before discount.

Total cost after discount = $45 - $7 = $38

Therefore, the total amount spent at the gardening shop is $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To determine the average height of heels at the cocktail party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and divide it by the total number of women.

There are 3 women wearing 4 inch heels and 3 women wearing 2 inch heels, resulting in a total of 6 women.

The total height of the 4 inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2 inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height of heels, we divide the total height by the total number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

Therefore, the average height of heels at the cocktail party is 3 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the additional miles Soledad must hike per day to complete her journey on time, we first calculate the total number of days available for hiking in June, which is 30.

Given that Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, her daily mileage is 125 * 2 = 250 miles.

To find the number of days required to complete 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the daily mileage: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

However, Soledad only has 30 days available, indicating that she will not be able to complete her journey within the given timeframe. To calculate the additional miles she must hike per day, we first determine the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find the additional miles per day, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

The final answer is: 60"

First, let's calculate the revenue from the red balls: 3 balls * $9 per ball = $27.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the blue balls: 11 balls * $5 per ball = $55.

Lastly, we calculate the revenue from the green balls: 25 balls * $3 per ball = $75.

Now, we sum the revenues from each type of ball to find the total revenue: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The final answer is: $157"
"To determine the amount of apples James will have left, we first need to calculate the portions taken by Pierre and Paul. 

Pierre's share is a quarter of the total 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 
Paul's share is one-third of the total 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

The combined amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

To find the amount left for James, we subtract the total taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount: 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

"To determine the amount of money Raymond has left, we need to consider the sequence of transactions he underwent.

Initially, Raymond had $21. He then saved $11 from his allowance, increasing his total to $21 + $11 = $32.

Following this, he spent $5 on a comic book, reducing his total to $32 - $5 = $27.

Lastly, he spent $19 on a puzzle, resulting in a final total of $27 - $19 = $8.

Therefore, the amount of money Raymond has left is $8."
"To determine the cost of each book, we first need to calculate the total amount spent on the books. Anna initially had a budget of $16 and had already spent $4, leaving her with $16 - $4 = $12. After purchasing the two books, she was left with $2, indicating that she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2.

$10 / 2 = $5

Therefore, each book cost $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To determine the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we need to calculate the 20% increase in enrollment from last year.

The formula to find the increase is: Increase = (Percentage Increase / 100) * Previous Enrollment
Increase = (20 / 100) * 50
Increase = 0.20 * 50
Increase = 10

Now, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment to find the current enrollment: Current Enrollment = Previous Enrollment + Increase
Current Enrollment = 50 + 10
Current Enrollment = 60

Therefore, the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year is 60.

60"
"To determine the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to establish the rate at which the light blinks per minute. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of blinks by the total number of minutes.

Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can calculate the rate per minute as follows:
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can divide the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

Therefore, the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times is 9 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the difference between the number of female and male fishes in Tate's garden pond, we need to calculate the total number of each sex.

Initially, there are 4 male guppies and 7 female guppies. Tate then acquires 2 additional male guppies and 1 female guppy, resulting in a total of 6 male guppies and 8 female guppies.

Similarly, there are initially 3 male goldfishes and 5 female goldfishes. After purchasing 2 male goldfishes and 3 female goldfishes, the total number of male goldfishes becomes 5 and the total number of female goldfishes becomes 8.

Now, we can calculate the total number of male and female fishes in the pond. The total number of male fishes is the sum of male guppies and male goldfishes, which is 6 + 5 = 11. The total number of female fishes is the sum of female guppies and female goldfishes, which is 8 + 8 = 16.

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes: 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total time required for Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their respective chores, we must first calculate the time taken by each individual.

Amalia's task was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours.

Megan's task was to walk the dog, and it is stated that this took her 2 hours longer than Amalia's task. Therefore, Megan's time can be calculated as 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

Dior's task was to do laundry, and it is mentioned that she took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia to complete her task. This implies that Dior took more than 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Given that Dior took ""well over"" 4 hours longer than Amalia, we can infer that Dior's time is at least 8 hours. However, to provide a precise answer, we must consider the minimum time Dior could have taken, which is 8 hours.

The total time required for all three individuals to complete their tasks is the sum of their individual times: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we must first calculate the distance of a round trip. Given that it takes him 2 hours to drive to his parents at a speed of 70 mph, we can use the formula Distance = Speed * Time to find the one-way distance.

Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since the round trip involves traveling to and from his parents' residence, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Considering John visits his parents twice a month, we can calculate the total distance driven in a month by multiplying the round-trip distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to calculate the total distance Sofie will cover in the same time frame. Given that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, her total distance in 7 days can be calculated as the product of her daily distance and the number of days, which yields 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

Since it is stated that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can infer that Brian's distance is half of Sofie's distance. Therefore, Brian's distance in 7 days is 70 / 2 = 35 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we first calculate the total number of toys produced by the four workers in a 10-hour shift. Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. Similarly, the other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, resulting in a combined production rate of 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. The total production rate for these four workers is therefore 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Over a 10-hour period, the total number of toys produced by these four workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys. Since the manufacturer still needs 20 additional toys to fulfill the order, the total number of toys required is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. Consequently, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining 420 - 200 = 220 toys.

Given that the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, we can calculate their production rate as follows: 220 toys / 10 hours = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we must first calculate the weight of each dog. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we can calculate its weight by dividing Kory's dog's weight by 4. This yields 60 / 4 = 15 pounds for Elijah's first dog.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we can calculate its weight by dividing Kory's dog's weight by 2. This yields 60 / 2 = 30 pounds for Elijah's second dog.

Now, we can find the total weight of Elijah's dogs by adding the weights of his two dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, we can work backwards from the information given. We know that Kris had 7 stickers, which is half of what Luis had. This implies that Luis had 7 * 2 = 14 stickers.

Since Luis had 14 stickers, which is half of what Seth had, we can infer that Seth had 14 * 2 = 28 stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 28 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the total number of small bags John can make, we first need to calculate the total number of M&M's he has. Since each large bag weighs 10 ounces and contains 30 M&M's per ounce, we can find the total number of M&M's by multiplying the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Given that John buys 3 large bags, the total number of M&M's is calculated as follows:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, to find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag, which is 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the circumference of the earth. The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. 

Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Now, we can calculate the number of days it will take Alfie to fly this distance by dividing the total distance (20,000 km) by the distance he flies per day (400 km).

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we can establish a series of relationships between the speeds of the average car, the 2nd fastest car, and the fastest car.

Let's denote the speed of the average car as A, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as B, and the speed of the fastest car as C. We are given that A = 120 miles per hour.

We are also given that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so B = 5A = 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Furthermore, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so C = 1.25B = 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To determine Vince's current age, we can start by establishing the relationship between Liam's and Vince's ages two years ago. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. According to the problem, Liam's age two years ago was twice that of Vince's, which can be expressed as:

Liam's age two years ago = 2 * Vince's age two years ago
14 = 2x

To find Vince's age two years ago, we can solve for 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 14 / 2
x = 7

Now that we know Vince's age two years ago, we can find his current age by adding 2 years to his age at that time:

Vince's current age = Vince's age two years ago + 2
Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can express this as A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, which can be represented as C + S = 30.

Furthermore, it is given that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so we can express this as C = S + 12.

We can use the equation C = S + 12 and substitute it into the equation C + S = 30 to solve for S. This gives us S + 12 + S = 30, which simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides yields 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we must first calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately, then sum these values.

The total weight of the crayons can be found by multiplying the number of crayons by the weight of each crayon. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Next, we need to determine the number of boxes required to hold the crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total revenue generated from selling the planks, we first need to calculate the number of logs that can be obtained from the 80-foot tree. Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Next, we divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, we multiply the number of logs by 5 to find the total number of planks.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

Finally, we calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank, which is $1.2.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate their individual salaries and then sum them.

Valerie's monthly salary is $5000. Her brother's monthly salary is twice hers, which is 2 * $5000 = $10,000. 

Their combined monthly salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. Their mother's monthly salary is twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between Grandma's speed on the beach and the sidewalk. Let's denote her speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Given that she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach can be calculated using the formula time = distance/speed. Therefore, the time spent on the beach is 2/x minutes.

We are given that the time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. So, we can set up the equation 2/x = 40. Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Next, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. Using the formula time = distance/speed, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of additional weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60, we first calculate the total amount she has saved so far. Given that she saves $4 per week for 8 weeks, the total amount saved is:

Total Amount Saved = Weekly Savings * Number of Weeks
Total Amount Saved = $4/week * 8 weeks
Total Amount Saved = $32

Next, we calculate the remaining amount she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:

Remaining Amount = Goal Amount - Total Amount Saved
Remaining Amount = $60 - $32
Remaining Amount = $28

Now, we can determine the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

Additional Weeks = Remaining Amount / Weekly Savings
Additional Weeks = $28 / $4/week
Additional Weeks = 7 weeks

Therefore, Jane needs 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"

First, we consider the 3 trees with 7 blue birds each. The total number of blue birds in this group is 3 * 7 = 21.

Next, we consider the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each. The total number of blue birds in this group is 2 * 4 = 8.

Lastly, we consider the single tree with 3 blue birds.

To find the total number of blue birds, we add the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the initial number of marbles Bob has. Let's denote this number as 'x'. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have a total of 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equivalent to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is x + 24 = 84.

To find the value of 'x', we can isolate it by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 84 - 24 = 60. This implies that Bob initially has 60 marbles.

Now, we are asked to determine the number of marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles. To find this, we subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles: 60 - 10 = 50.

Therefore, the correct answer is 50."
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle).

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40.

Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 / 2 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 >= 80
165 + 5x >= 80
5x >= 80 - 165
5x >= -85
x >= -85 / 5
x >= -17

However, since the temperature cannot be negative, we need to consider the minimum value of x that satisfies the condition. In this case, the minimum value of x is 40 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, the farm has 50 cows and 20 chickens. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks.

The number of cows added in three weeks is calculated as follows: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows. Therefore, the total number of cows is 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows.

Similarly, the number of chickens added in three weeks is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens. Consequently, the total number of chickens is 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.

To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we add the total number of cows and chickens: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To determine the cost of each single bagel after a 10% discount on a purchase of 4 packs, we first calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels and costs $10.00.

The total cost of 4 packs is given by the product of the cost of one pack and the number of packs: 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Next, we calculate the discount, which is 10% of the total cost. This is given by 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The discounted cost is then obtained by subtracting the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs, which is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

Therefore, the cost of each single bagel after the 10% discount is $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To determine the number of potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to establish the relationship between scoops of mashed potatoes and the number of potatoes required to make them. It is given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's denote the number of potatoes required to make 1 less than 3 scoops as 'x'. Then, we have the equation: x = 6 - 3, which simplifies to x = 3. This means it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we are given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. Therefore, the number of scoops Gomer ate is 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, we can find the number of potatoes Gomer ate by dividing the total number of scoops by 2 and then multiplying by 3. This gives us (18 / 2) * 3 = 27 potatoes.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we must first calculate the number of eggs he consumes in the first 30 days and the subsequent 30 days.

In the initial 30 days, Chester's daily egg consumption is 3 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed during this period is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Following this, Chester increases his daily egg consumption to 5 eggs. Consequently, the total number of eggs consumed in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed over the 60-day period, we sum the eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we can calculate the number of dozens by dividing the total number of eggs by 12: 240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans in the jar, we first need to establish the total number of red jellybeans. Given that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

The total number of green and red jellybeans is then 17 + 34 = 51.

To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans in the jar is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we need to calculate the annual yield and then extrapolate it over a 10-year period.

First, we establish the annual yield by multiplying the number of trees by the number of lemons collected from each tree: 5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year.

Next, we calculate the total number of lemons collected over a decade by multiplying the annual yield by the number of years: 30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons.

Therefore, the total number of lemons collected in a decade is 300."
"To determine the number of women who remained on the bus after 20 women alighted, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially.

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. The fraction of women in the ratio is 9/14.

To find the number of women on the bus, we can set up a proportion: (9/14) * Total Passengers = Number of Women. Substituting the given total number of passengers (84), we get (9/14) * 84 = 54.

Now, we subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus: 54 - 20 = 34.

Therefore, the number of women who remained on the bus is 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the total number of sunflowers sold by Faraday, we need to calculate the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets and individual sunflowers separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets. Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers and Faraday sells 7 bouquets per day, the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is:

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Next, we calculate the number of sunflowers sold from individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earns $26 from individual sunflowers per day, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets and individual sunflowers:

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we multiply the daily total by 3:

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

The final answer is: 291"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he purchases, the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory, and then find the difference between the two.

First, we calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy with his initial investment of $100, given that each rock costs $5. This is done by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Next, we find the number of rocks Adam sells, which is 60% of his total inventory:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * 7 = 84

The cost of purchasing 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * 5 = 100

However, since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * 5 = 40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

100 + 40 = 140

Now, we subtract the revenue from the total cost to find the amount of money Adam loses:

140 - 84 = 56

The final answer is: $56"
"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum of these values.

First, let's calculate the number of days it will take to complete the large-sized picture scenes. Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day. To find the number of days required, we divide the total number of large-sized scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days.

Next, we calculate the number of days it will take to complete the medium-sized picture scenes. Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day. To find the number of days required, we divide the total number of medium-sized scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days.

Finally, we calculate the number of days it will take to complete the small-sized picture scenes. Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day. To find the number of days required, we divide the total number of small-sized scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days.

Comparing the number of days required for each type of scene, we find that the maximum value is 9 days, which corresponds to the large-sized picture scenes. Therefore, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs: 3 dozen eggs. Since a dozen is equal to 12, we multiply 3 by 12 to get the total number of eggs.

3 * 12 = 36 eggs

Now, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children, which is 4.

36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child

Therefore, each child receives 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May, we first need to calculate the daily expenditure. Since each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost is 3 * $1 = $3.

Next, we need to account for the number of days in May, which is 31. To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days: $3 * 31 = $93.

Therefore, the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May is $93.

The final answer is: $93"
"To determine the current number of roses Patricia possesses, we must first account for the roses she gave away. Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. After giving 24 roses to her mother, she is left with 30 - 24 = 6 roses.

Subsequently, Patricia purchased 15 additional roses. To find the total number of roses she now has, we add the roses she bought to the remaining roses: 6 + 15 = 21.

Therefore, Patricia currently has 21 roses."
"To determine Sid's average speed, we must first calculate the total distance he traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance is the sum of the distances traveled in the two segments, which is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles. 

The total time is the sum of the times taken for the two segments, which is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed at which Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to consider the individual probabilities of each ticket winning. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.2. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

The probability of both tickets winning is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationships between the number of seashells collected by each individual. Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Jim as J, Carlos as C, and Carrey as R.

From the given information, we know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so we can express this as J = C + 5. We are also told that Jim collected 27 seashells, which allows us to write the equation C + 5 = 27. Solving for C, we find that C = 22.

Furthermore, we are informed that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, which can be expressed as C = 2R. Substituting the value of C we found earlier, we get 22 = 2R. Solving for R, we find that R = 11.

Now that we have the number of seashells collected by each individual, we can calculate the total number of seashells: J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.

To determine how many seashells each person gets when they divide the total number of seashells equally among themselves, we divide the total by 3: 60 / 3 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he consumes on weekdays and then add the number he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays, which consist of 5 days (Monday to Friday). Therefore, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots.

On the weekend, Mason eats 5 carrots each day, which includes Saturday and Sunday. Consequently, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots.

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend. This results in a total of 20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total time of the cassette, we first need to calculate the length of the second song. Given that it is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes, we can express this as an equation.

Let x be the length of the second song. Then, x = 5 + 0.6(5), where 0.6 represents 60% as a decimal.

Simplifying the equation, we get x = 5 + 3, which equals 8 minutes.

Now that we have the lengths of both songs, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of the two songs.

Total time = 5 + 8 = 13 minutes

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine the total profit earned by Linus, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then sum them together.

First, let's calculate the profit from Monday. Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each, resulting in a total cost price of 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. Therefore, the total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

Next, we calculate the profit from Tuesday. Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each, resulting in a total cost price of 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. Therefore, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we must first establish the height of each individual involved. Given that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now, we can determine the length of Carl's cane, which is half as long as his height:

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

"To determine the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first calculate the number of bottles required to cover the daily energy needs of one person. Given that each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to find the number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

To do this, we divide 100% by 20%, which is equivalent to dividing 1 by 0.2. This gives us 5 bottles per person.

Now, to find the total number of bottles required to cover the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we multiply the number of bottles per person by the total number of people: 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find the difference between the required production and the current production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

Therefore, Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles per day to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7300}$"
"To determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to calculate the proportion of babies wearing purple bows out of the total number of babies wearing bows.

First, let's find the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 of the 8 babies are wearing purple, which is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Next, we need to find the number of babies wearing purple and bows. Since 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows, we can calculate this as 1/3 * 6 = 2.

Now, let's find the total number of babies wearing bows. This is the sum of the babies wearing blue and purple bows, which is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

The probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is then the number of babies wearing purple bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, which is 2/4 = 1/2 or 50%.

"To determine the number of tax reports received by the IRS on Wednesday, we can utilize a straightforward approach by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtracting that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Let's denote the total number of reports received last week as T, the reports received on Monday and Tuesday as M, and the reports received on Thursday and Friday as F. We are given that T = 5168, M = 1907, and F = 2136.

The number of reports received on Wednesday can be calculated as follows:

Reports received on Wednesday = T - (M + F)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

Therefore, the number of reports received by the IRS on Wednesday is 1125.

"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, let's consider the initial sale. Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Since half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters, we can calculate the price per square meter as $50 / 40 = $1.25 per square meter.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since 1/4 of 80 square meters is 20 square meters, we can calculate the price per square meter as $30 / 20 = $1.5 per square meter.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. The first sale was for 40 square meters at $1.25 per square meter, which is 40 * $1.25 = $50. The second sale was for 20 square meters at $1.5 per square meter, which is 20 * $1.5 = $30. The third sale was for 20 square meters at $3 per square meter, which is 20 * $3 = $60.

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To determine Geb's age, we first need to calculate half of Haley's age. Given that Haley is 26 years old, we can find this by dividing her age by 2.

Haley's age: 26 years
Half of Haley's age: 26 / 2 = 13 years

Now, we are told that Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. To find Geb's age, we subtract 10 from the calculated half of Haley's age.

Geb's age: 13 - 10 = 3 years

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"To determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we first need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day. Given that he changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find the number of face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2.

6 * 2 = 12

Therefore, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is 12."
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we must first calculate the total number of eggs found by each individual. 

Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy, who finds twice as many as Lamar, finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie, who finds 2 less than Stacy, finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei, who finds half as many as Charlie, finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is the sum of the eggs found by each individual: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole initially hid 3 dozen eggs, we must convert this to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs initially hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we first need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects from. The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, resulting in a combined total of 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% larger than this combined total. To find the size of the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400, which is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to the combined total of the first two complexes gives us 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments by adding the size of the third complex to the combined total of the first two complexes: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex, the total number of apartments he collects from per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments.

Given that he earns $0.40 per collection, his weekly earnings can be calculated as 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To determine the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10-year lifespan, we need to calculate the production for each year and sum them up.

Let's start by calculating the production for each year:

- Year 1 (5 years old): The tree produces 50 fruits.
- Year 2 (6 years old): The tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- Year 3 (7 years old): The tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- Year 4 (8 years old): The tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet, let's call it 'x'. Therefore, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 5 (9 years old): The tree doesn't produce any fruits.
- Year 6 (10 years old): The tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree to calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits, we can set up the equation x = 1000.

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000, x = 1200. Therefore, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 0 + 1000 = 1550

The final answer is: $\boxed{1550}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jack has after Sophia gives him 1/5 of her $100, we first need to calculate the value of 1/5 of $100.

1/5 of $100 can be calculated as $100 divided by 5, which equals $20.

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

Therefore, Jack now has $120.

"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationships between the lengths of the three ropes. Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We are given that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, which can be expressed as R = 4B. Additionally, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we have B = Y - 7.

We also know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, which gives us the equation R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the initial amounts of money Ronnie and Rissa were given. Let's denote the amount given to Ronnie as $5. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, she was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given 'x'. Therefore, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This can be expressed as (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.
(15 - x) = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the amount of red paint used in the mural, we can start by establishing the relationship between the different colors. Given that there are four colors of paint â€“ red, white, purple, and yellow â€“ and that half the mural is yellow, the remaining half consists of the other three colors.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x. The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints, and since half of it is yellow, the other half is 6 pints, which is the combination of red, white, and purple paint.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

"To determine the total area of the house, we must first calculate the area of each component and then sum them together.

The area of a single bedroom is calculated as the product of its length and width, which is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is stated to be 5 times larger than a single bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we sum the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

Therefore, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3160}$"
"To determine the total number of clouds Alice counted over the five-day period, we can utilize a geometric progression. The sequence of cloud counts is as follows: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48.

This sequence represents a geometric progression with a first term of 3 and a common ratio of 2. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 3, r = 2, and n = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
S = 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted over the five-day period is 93."
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $1, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the new box. Given that the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can find this by adding 20% of 100 to 100.

20% of 100 is calculated as 0.2 * 100 = 20. Therefore, the new box contains 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the new box costs $12 and each cycle requires one pod, we can calculate the total number of cycles that can be run with the new box for $12 as 120 cycles.

To find the number of cycles that can be run for $1, we divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $1 is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of steps.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home, resulting in 50 - 10 = 40 bills remaining.

He then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. Consequently, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

Subsequently, he triples his money, which implies tripling the number of bills. Therefore, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

The final numerical answer is: $300"
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the soccer match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate the remaining length of the chalk after Monday and then find out how many days it will last at a rate of 20% usage per day.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny purchased, we first need to establish the number of face masks Mike bought. It is given that Mike acquired 5 face masks.

Next, we calculate three times the amount Mike purchased, which is 3 * 5 = 15 face masks.

Since Johnny bought 2 more face masks than this calculated amount, we add 2 to 15, resulting in 17 face masks.

Therefore, the correct answer is 17."
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist treats and then express this as a percentage of the total number of teeth James has.

The dentist drills 4 teeth, and then caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth the dentist caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth he drills and the teeth he caps, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the total number of teeth the dentist fixes by the total number of teeth James has, and then multiply by 100. This gives us (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus is eligible for a refund, we first need to calculate 2/5 of the total amount of milk he purchased. This can be done by multiplying 2/5 by 4000 gallons.

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons of milk were returned.

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.

Refund = 1600 * 3.5 = 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information. Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

Therefore, Colin's current age is 20 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can purchase for each school, we first need to calculate the total number of books he can buy with the given amount of money. 

The cost of 100 books is $500, so the number of books per dollar is 100/500 = 0.2 books per dollar. 

Now, we can calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000.

Total books = 0.2 books/dollar * $27,000
Total books = 5,400

Since Bob is distributing the money to 3 schools, we can find the number of books per school by dividing the total number of books by 3.

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 5,400 / 3
Books per school = 1,800

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"To determine the number of apples Newton brought home, let's analyze the situation step by step.

Initially, two apples fell out of the tree. Newton then picked up these two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other back into the tree, causing five more apples to fall out. This means he now has one apple in his pocket and five new apples.

Next, he put all but one of the new apples in his pocket, leaving one apple outside. At this point, he has one apple outside and five apples in his pocket.

Subsequently, he threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing six more apples to fall out. This means he now has the six apples from the previous step and six new apples. Therefore, the total number of apples he has at this point is 12.

Finally, he picked up all the remaining apples, so he now has 12 apples in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we first need to calculate the number of 50 kg bags required to meet his needs. This can be achieved by dividing the total weight of coal ordered by the weight per bag.

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Given that each bag costs $18, we can now calculate the total cost of the order by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag.

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will consume. Given that each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, and there are 6 friends, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. 

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

Similarly, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24. Given that each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Therefore, Kate needs to purchase a total of 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles he ran on each day and then sum them up.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This is a total of 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, he ran 5 miles each day, which amounts to 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

Therefore, the total miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles.

"To determine the time it will take for Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs, we must consider the rates at which he constructs and loses snowballs. 

Jay constructs snowballs at a rate of 20 per hour, which is equivalent to 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. Conversely, he loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes, resulting in a loss rate of 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate of snowball accumulation, we subtract the loss rate from the construction rate: (1/3) - (2/15). To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator, which is 15. Therefore, we can rewrite the construction rate as (5/15) and proceed with the subtraction: (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15. Simplifying this fraction yields 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Given that Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we can calculate the time required to accumulate 60 snowballs by dividing the target number of snowballs by the net rate of accumulation: 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to accumulate 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine Jim's current age, we must first calculate John's age 20 years ago. Given that John is currently 28 years old, we can find his age 20 years ago by subtracting 20 from his current age: 28 - 20 = 8.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can find Jim's age at that time by dividing John's age 20 years ago by 2: 8 / 2 = 4.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total number of slices of apple eaten by Doxa and her siblings, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, which means her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother, in turn, ate 1 more slice than her sister, resulting in her brother eating 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices consumed by each individual: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach to track the number of bandages used and ordered by the nurses over the three days.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. Therefore, the number of bandages they had at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, the number of bandages they had at the end of the second day is (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They also used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. Therefore, the number of bandages they had at the end of the third day is ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

Therefore, the initial number of bandages the nurses had on the first day is 21.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color treatment, we must first calculate the difference in the length of her hair before and after the service. 

Initial length: 10 inches
Final length: 8 inches
Difference in length: 10 - 8 = 2 inches

Given that the cost per inch of haircut is $30, we can calculate the cost for the 2-inch reduction as follows:

Cost per inch: $30
Cost for 2 inches: 2 * $30 = $60

Additionally, the color treatment costs $40. Therefore, the total cost of the haircut and color treatment is the sum of these two amounts:

Total cost = $60 + $40 = $100

"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her regular pay and attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April. Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours. Given her hourly rate of $1.5, her regular pay is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Next, we calculate her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, we can find her total earnings by adding her regular pay and attendance bonus: Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus = $270 + $240 = $510.

The final answer is: $510"

"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we must first calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

Alain's mom purchased 5 packs of red pens. Given that each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Furthermore, it is stated that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the total cost of John's purchase, we must first calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then sum them.

The cost of the scotch can be found by dividing the total cost of the scotch by the number of bottles. Given that the total cost of the scotch is $600 and the number of bottles is 10, the cost per bottle is $600 / 10 = $60.

Next, we calculate the cost of the cognac. It is stated that the number of bottles of cognac is twice the number of bottles of scotch, which is 2 * 10 = 20 bottles. Furthermore, the cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, which is equivalent to 1.5 times the cost of the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 * 1.5 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is then found by multiplying the cost per bottle by the number of bottles, which is 20 * $90 = $1800.

Finally, the total cost of John's purchase is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac, which is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees separately and then add them together.

Let's begin by identifying the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day. Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day is 2 * 20 = 40.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, resulting in a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. Additionally, he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is equivalent to 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. Therefore, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 30
Lodgepole Pine: 90

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is the sum of the White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 30 + 90 = 120.

"To solve this problem, we can start by translating the given statement into a mathematical equation. The phrase ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be represented as 4x + 8, where x is the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

We are given that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we first need to calculate the number of fish with red stripes. One-third of the total fish have red stripes, which can be calculated as follows:

Total fish = 66
Fish with red stripes = (1/3) * 66 = 22

Next, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish:

Fish without red stripes = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish, which represents the number of fish with blue stripes:

Fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * 44 = 20

Finally, we can determine the total number of fish with red and blue stripes by adding the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

"To determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we first need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had. She had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, which gives us 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes. Additionally, she had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each, resulting in 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

Combining these, Amy initially had a total of 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister then stole one of the palettes, which contained 4 eyeshadow colors. This leaves Amy with 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Subsequently, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 eyeshadow colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Now, we subtract the used eyeshadow colors from the remaining total: 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we must first establish the height of the second floor. Given that Mattison's height is 60 inches, we can deduce the following:

1. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, which yields a total height of 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
2. The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, resulting in a height of 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the two-story house is 420 inches, and the first floor's height is 180 inches, we can calculate the height of the second floor by subtracting the first floor's height from the total height of the house:
420 - 180 = 240 inches

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to consider the height of the second floor. However, the question asks for the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, which implies the space above the second floor. Therefore, we should calculate the height of the roof from the second floor by subtracting the height of the second floor from the total height of the house:
420 - 240 = 180 inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we first need to calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas, which is 40% of the total shells.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Next, we calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share.

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Then, we find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we can determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"To determine the miles walked by the last dog, we can start by calculating the total miles walked by all four dogs. Given that the average miles walked per dog is 3, we can find the total miles by multiplying the average by the number of dogs: 3 miles/dog * 4 dogs = 12 miles.

Next, we can find the miles walked by the last dog by subtracting the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs. The first three dogs walk a total of 1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles.

Now, we can find the miles walked by the last dog: 12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

The last dog needs 4 miles."

The value of his house is $250,000. To find 40% of this value, we multiply it by 0.4.

$250,000 * 0.4 = $100,000

This is the amount John borrowed. He then used 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. To find 60% of $100,000, we multiply it by 0.6.

$100,000 * 0.6 = $60,000

Now, to find out how much money John had leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the amount borrowed.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

Therefore, John had $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To determine the total earnings from selling the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the three tunas caught by Deandre. This can be achieved by summing the weights of the individual tunas.

The weight of the first tuna is 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Given that a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight of the tunas by the cost per kilogram.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. Given that she sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for, we can express this as a multiplier of the cost price.

The cost price of the magazines is $72. To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:

Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.

The final answer is: $27"
"To determine the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then sum these values.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.  When operated for 3 days, the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day.  When operated for 3 days, the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.  When operated for 5 days, the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

The total amount of water removed is the sum of the water removed on each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of balloons thrown during the water balloon fight, we first calculate the total number of balloons available. Given that there are 10 packs of balloons, each containing 30 balloons, the total number of balloons is the product of these two quantities.

Total number of balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons

Next, we subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons to find the number of balloons thrown.

Number of balloons thrown = Total number of balloons - Number of balloons left
= 300 - 12
= 288

Therefore, the number of balloons thrown during the water balloon fight is 288."
"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we first need to calculate the amount of the second medicine. Since the second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, and the first medicine is 14 mL, the second medicine is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the first and second medicine, which is 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to calculate the capacity of John's classes. Given that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can find the capacity of each of John's classes by dividing 120 by 8.

120 / 8 = 15 students per class

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's class to the capacity of John's classes.

Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

The final answer is: 150"
"To determine the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, resulting in a total of 11 * 25 = $275 paid in the first 11 months.

The remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. This is calculated as 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine the number of diapers Jordan changes per day, we first calculate the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, so the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. This implies that Jordan changes the remaining half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of red jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the total volume of the jar. Given that the jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, we can calculate the volume as follows:

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Next, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean, which is 0.15 cubic inches.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Given that 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to determine the number of red jelly beans he guessed. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the problem. 

However, we can calculate the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans that would be expected if the jar was 100% efficient and all jelly beans were red. 

The volume of the jar if it were 100% efficient and all jelly beans were red would be 540 cubic inches. The number of jelly beans in this scenario would be 540 / 0.15 = 3600. The number of red jelly beans in this scenario would be 3600 * 0.3 = 1080.

The difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans in the 100% efficient scenario is 1080 - 900 = 180.

The difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans in the 80% efficient scenario is 864 - 900 = -36.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the initial number of people on the bus and the number of people who have already occupied the bus.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 60. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus, which is 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, resulting in a total of 2 * 90 = 180 people.

To find the number of remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

Therefore, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for two distinct periods: the initial 5 years and the subsequent 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of a single visit is $2. Given that Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual expenditure is 3 * $2 = $6. Consequently, the total cost for the initial 5-year period is 5 * $6 = $30.

Following the initial 5-year period, the cost of a single visit increases by 150%. This implies that the new cost of a visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. Consequently, the annual expenditure for the subsequent 3 years is 3 * $5 = $15. The total cost for the next 3 years is 3 * $15 = $45.

To obtain the total expenditure for all visits, we sum the costs of the two periods: $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the total time required for all students to participate in the escape room, we must first calculate the total number of students and then divide this number by the capacity of the escape room.

There are 4 grades at Cedar Falls Middle School, with 10 students in each grade. Therefore, the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

The escape room can accommodate 8 students at a time. To find the number of groups required, we divide the total number of students by the capacity of the escape room: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group requires 45 minutes to attempt the escape room, and there are 5 groups, the total time required for all students to participate is 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To determine the total amount Ali owes John, we need to calculate the cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately, then sum these values.

The cost of the tables is 4 units * $20 per unit = $80. This is a straightforward application of the multiplication principle.

The cost of the roof frames is 2 units * $10 per unit = $20. Again, this is a simple multiplication problem.

To find the total amount owed, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames: $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, Ali owes John $100."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of their lengths is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs for the cookout, we must first calculate the total pounds of ground beef required to produce 80 meatballs. Given that he obtains 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the total pounds of meat needed by dividing the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can calculate the total seasoning required by multiplying the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"To determine the number of cupcakes Carly made, we can establish a relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies can be expressed as 3x - 2.

Since each person in the class receives two treats, and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, which can be represented by the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Solving the equation, we get:
x + 3x - 2 = 10
4x - 2 = 10
4x = 12
x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To determine the total cost of the services, we first need to calculate the discounted prices of the manicure and pedicure. The manicure starts at $35, and a 20% discount is applied, which is 0.2 * 35 = $7. Therefore, the discounted price of the manicure is $35 - $7 = $28.

Similarly, the pedicure starts at $40, and a 20% discount is applied, which is 0.2 * 40 = $8. Thus, the discounted price of the pedicure is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is the sum of their discounted prices, which is $28 + $32 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

"To determine the number of paintings Kim has, we can establish a relationship between the number of paintings each person possesses. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K, the number of paintings Shelley has as S, and the number of paintings Samantha has as Sa.

We are given that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, which can be expressed as Sa = S - 12. We also know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, which can be expressed as S = K + 8. Furthermore, we are informed that Samantha has 27 paintings, so Sa = 27.

Substituting the value of Sa into the first equation, we get 27 = S - 12. Solving for S, we find S = 39. Now, we can substitute the value of S into the second equation, 39 = K + 8. Solving for K, we find K = 31.

Therefore, the number of paintings Kim has is 31.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"

First, we need to find the price increase in December. An 80% increase from the initial price of $40 is calculated as follows:
Price increase = 80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we calculate the price decrease in January. A 50% decrease from the price in December is calculated as follows:
Price decrease = 50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

Therefore, the final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the revenue generated from both the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the standard rate lessons. Charlie has 4 one-hour lessons at a rate of $80 per hour. Therefore, the total revenue from the standard rate lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the revenue from the reduced rate lessons. Charlie has 2 one-hour lessons at a reduced rate of 75% of his standard rate. The reduced rate is calculated as $80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour. Consequently, the total revenue from the reduced rate lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we add the revenue from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons. Therefore, the total revenue is $320 + $120 = $440.

"To calculate the mean score, we first need to sum up all the scores. The scores are as follows: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

Let's add up the scores step by step:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630. Since there are 9 scores in total, we can now calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the total number of scores.

"To determine the number of pomelos Eve gave away, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let x be the number of pomelos Eve gave away.

Initially, Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the original amount. This can be expressed as:

20 - x = (1/4) * 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 - x = 5

To solve for x, we isolate the variable by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

-x = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x:

x = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

"To determine the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples, we first need to calculate the number of apples he had after eating 2/5 of the total.

Let's start by finding 2/5 of 60, which is the number of apples Walter ate.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

Now, we can find the number of apples remaining by subtracting the number eaten from the total.

60 - 24 = 36

Next, we need to find 25% of the remaining 36 apples, which is the number Walter gave to his sister.

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

Now, we can find the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples sold by the price per apple.

"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we first need to calculate the total distance he traveled in 3 days. Given that there are 24 hours in a day, the total time elapsed is 3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance covered by multiplying the average speed by the total time elapsed. The average speed is 50 km/hr, so the distance covered is 50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km.

To find the percentage of the distance covered, we divide the distance covered by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, which is 6000 km, and then multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

Therefore, the percentage of the distance covered by Michael is 60%.

"To determine the initial number of grapes, we can start by analyzing the information provided. Madeline consumed 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as she did to make a full glass, which equates to 6 * 5 = 30 grapes. The combined total of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

The remaining grapes were then utilized by their mother to prepare 4 pies. Given that each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she could make is 36 / 12 = 3. Consequently, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.

The total number of grapes consumed by all three individuals is 36 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) + 36 (by their mother) = 102 grapes. Since the mother used all the remaining grapes to make 3 pies, it can be inferred that the initial number of grapes was sufficient to cover the total consumption of 102 grapes.

Therefore, the initial number of grapes is 102.

"To determine the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in a year, we must first calculate the weekly cost of the ingredients. The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. The cheddar cheese costs $3.00, and the gruyere cheese costs twice that amount, which is $6.00.

The total weekly cost of the macaroni and cheese is the sum of the costs of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate the total annual cost by multiplying the weekly cost by 52: $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

Therefore, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in a year is $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To determine the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time available for cleaning and the total time required to clean all classrooms.

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task, and they work 8 hours a day. Therefore, the total time available for cleaning is 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

Next, we calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning classrooms is 50%.

"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first calculate the capacity of each shelf. The middle shelves can hold 10 books each, while the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, resulting in a capacity of 15 books.

The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all its shelves: 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we can calculate the number of bookcases needed by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2.

Therefore, Elly requires 2 bookcases to accommodate all of her books.

"To calculate Rose's profit, we first need to determine the total cost of the eggs and the total revenue from selling them.

The cost of five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen is calculated as follows:

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose purchased a total of 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

To find the total revenue, we need to determine how many sets of 3 eggs Rose can sell. This is calculated as:

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Given that she sells each set for $1, the total revenue is:

20 sets * $1/set = $20

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the number of white hats, we first calculate the number of red hats, which is half of the total number of hats. Given that Skyler has 100 hats, the number of red hats is 100 * 0.5 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Next, we calculate the number of blue hats, which is 3/5 of the remaining hats. This is equivalent to 50 * (3/5) = 30.

The number of white hats is then the difference between the remaining hats and the number of blue hats, which is 50 - 30 = 20.

Therefore, the number of white hats is 20.

"To determine the cost of each stick of beef jerky, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the bag. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it is discounted by $3.00. 

Discounted price = Original price - Discount
Discounted price = $18.00 - $3.00
Discounted price = $15.00

To convert the discounted price to cents, we multiply it by 100:
Discounted price (in cents) = $15.00 * 100
Discounted price (in cents) = 1500 cents

Now, we can find the cost of each stick of jerky by dividing the discounted price in cents by the number of sticks per bag:
Cost per stick = Discounted price (in cents) / Number of sticks per bag

"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she must answer correctly to pass. 

The total number of questions is the sum of the questions on both tests, which is 70 + 40 = 110.

Since Audrey must correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade, we can calculate this as 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we need to find out how many questions she got right on the first test. This is given as 60% of 70 questions, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right: 77 - 42 = 35.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B.

We know that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be expressed as B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116, which can be expressed as S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combining like terms, we have 6S - 4 = 116.

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get 6S = 120.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find that S = 20.

Now that we know the value of S, we can find the value of B by substituting S into the expression B = 5S - 4, which gives us B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"To determine the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can calculate the total points by multiplying the number of games she played each year by her score per game and then multiplying the result by the number of years.

"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus, we can break down the problem into a series of steps.

First, we need to establish the conversion rate from customers to sales. Given that for every 2 customers who come into the car dealership, 1 will buy a car, we can express this as a ratio of 1:2. To sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the car dealership.

Next, we need to establish the conversion rate from telephone calls to customers. Given that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 person comes into the car dealership, we can express this as a ratio of 1:25. To get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights being used by Brianna's family, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the flashlights. There are 4 people in the household, and each person has a flashlight. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, we'll calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since half of 8 is 4, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of chips each family member receives, we first need to calculate the total number of chips available. Since Mitchell purchases two bags of chips, each containing 55 chips, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Next, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find the individual allocation. With 5 family members, the calculation is 110 / 5 = 22.

Therefore, each family member will receive 22 chips.

"To determine the total time required to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time taken for each side and then sum these values.

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each. 
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides: 
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

The total time required to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To determine the number of calls Tim deals with in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate the number of calls he handles in a single day. Given that he spends 6 hours at work and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, we must convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is equivalent to 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can calculate the number of calls he handles in a day by dividing the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

To find the total number of calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5: 24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the additional time required for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish compared to the old varnish, we first calculate the total drying time for each type of varnish. 

The time it takes for the old varnish to dry on one painting is 7 minutes. Therefore, the total time for 6 paintings is 7 minutes * 6 = 42 minutes.

The time it takes for the new varnish to dry on one painting is 12 minutes. Consequently, the total time for 6 paintings is 12 minutes * 6 = 72 minutes.

To find the difference in drying time between the old and new varnishes, we subtract the time for the old varnish from the time for the new varnish: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the additional time required for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we must first calculate the water required for each type of plant and then sum these values.

The 8 plants that require 1 cup of water each will need a total of 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

The remaining plants, which are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 in number, require a quarter of a cup of water each. Therefore, the total water needed for these plants is 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we add the water required for each type of plant: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the time it takes for Phineas Frog to return home, we must consider the distances and speeds involved in both his hopping and swimming.

Given that Phineas is 200 yards away from home, we can divide this distance into two equal segments, each 100 yards long, as he will need to cover half of the distance on land and the other half in water.

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute on land, so the time taken to cover 100 yards on land is 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

Similarly, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute in water, so the time taken to cover 100 yards in water is 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Therefore, the total time taken for Phineas to return home is the sum of the time taken for each segment, which is 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to purchase the necessary popsicle sticks for his project is $14.00."
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we need to establish the cost of the additional phones and then sum this with the cost of the main phone.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

Given that the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

With the cost of each additional phone determined to be $10, we can calculate the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"

"To determine the time it takes for John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and after training, it is 2.5 times faster.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Next, we calculate the total number of words in 10 pages, assuming each page has 450 words.

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

Now, we can find the time it takes to speak 4500 words at the new speed.

Time = Total words / New speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

Time (hours) = (4500 words / 375 WPM) / 60 = 12 hours

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining four days.

On the first day, Conor observed 50 people. On the second day, the number of people increased by 20, resulting in 70 individuals. On the third day, the number of people doubled from the second day, totaling 140 individuals.

The cumulative total for the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

For the remaining four days, Conor observed an average of 60 people per day. Therefore, the total number of people he saw on these days is 60 * 4 = 240.

To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the cumulative totals for the first three days and the remaining four days: 260 + 240 = 500.

"To determine the total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

The final answer is: 210"
"To determine the total number of lemons required, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade to be prepared. Since Tim wants to make 4 gallons for the party and an additional gallon for Allen, the total amount of lemonade is 5 gallons.

Each gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice. Therefore, the total amount of lemon juice needed is 5 cups.

The extra tart lemonade requires twice the amount of lemon juice as the regular lemonade, which means it requires 2 cups of lemon juice. This leaves 5 - 2 = 3 cups of lemon juice for the regular lemonade.

Now, we can calculate the number of lemons required for the regular lemonade. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the number of lemons required for 3 cups of juice is 3 * 6 = 18 lemons.

For the extra tart lemonade, 2 cups of juice require 2 * 6 = 12 lemons.

Therefore, the total number of lemons required is 18 + 12 = 30 lemons.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is therefore 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the tower consists of 32 blocks in total, we can find the number of red blocks by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we need to consider the net displacement, which is the difference between the distance traveled in the westward direction and the distance traveled in the eastward direction.

Let's calculate the distance traveled in each direction. The average speed is given as 18 miles per hour, and the time taken for each part of the journey is provided. 

For the westward journey, the distance traveled is the product of the speed and time: 18 miles/hour * 5 hours = 90 miles.

For the eastward journey, the distance traveled is the product of the speed and time: 18 miles/hour * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Now, to find the net displacement, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east: 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

"To determine the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%, which is equivalent to 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. Therefore, the value of the boat after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30%, which is equivalent to 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. Therefore, the value of the boat after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%, which is equivalent to 0.2 * $4410 = $882. Therefore, the value of the boat after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we must first establish the quantities of the other colored candies. 

Given that the bag contains 54 red candies, we are informed that the number of orange candies is twice that amount. Therefore, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

Furthermore, we are told that the number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies. Consequently, the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

To find the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies, we sum these quantities: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since the bag contains a total of 232 candies, the number of pink candies can be calculated by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the overall total: 232 - 189 = 43.

"To determine the force required to move the car, we must first calculate the total weight of the car, its contents, and the occupants. The car itself weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each.

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Given that the force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight, we can calculate this force as follows:

Force = 1% * total weight
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force required to move the car is 16 pounds.

"To determine the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs, we first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Given that each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs required is:

20 guests * 2 hot dogs per guest = 40 hot dogs

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, we subtract these from the total required:

40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:

36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs per pack = 6 packs

Now, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to determine the total amount John needs to spend:

6 packs * $2 per pack = $12

"To determine the amount of money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies, and then subtract her total expenses for purchasing trays.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes: 20 cupcakes at $2 each yields a total of 20 * $2 = $40. Similarly, selling 40 cookies at $1 each results in 40 * $1 = $40. Therefore, her total earnings from both cupcakes and cookies amount to $40 + $40 = $80.

Next, we need to calculate her expenses for purchasing trays. Since she bought 5 trays at $4 each, her total expenses are 5 * $4 = $20.

Now, to find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings: $80 - $20 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the number of children following the ice cream truck, we can analyze the situation step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children at the end of the first street. On the second street, each of these children is joined by another child, resulting in a total of 5 + 5 = 10 children.

Moving to the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 additional children. This can be calculated as 10 * 2 = 20, and then added to the existing 10 children, resulting in a total of 10 + 20 = 30 children.

However, the original 5 children then leave the group, leaving us with 30 - 5 = 25 children following the ice cream truck.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to calculate the total number of meals she has already given out and then subtract this from the total number of meals she initially had.

The meals given out on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are 64, 30, and 48, respectively. To find the total meals given out, we sum these values:

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48
Total meals given out = 142

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the initial number of meals Mamou had to find the meals left to distribute:

Meals left to distribute = Total meals Mamou has - Total meals given out
Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142
Meals left to distribute = 1,218

"To determine the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and sum them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents, as it is a standard denomination in the United States monetary system. Two nickels, being worth 5 cents each, amount to 2 x 5 = 10 cents. Seven dimes, with each dime valued at 10 cents, collectively total 7 x 10 = 70 cents.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money James has by adding the values of the quarter, nickels, and dimes together:
25 (quarter) + 10 (nickels) + 70 (dimes) = 105 cents

The final answer is: 105"
"To determine the total age of the siblings, we first need to establish the age of the older brother. Given that one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, we can deduce that the older brother's age is 12 * 2 = 24 years.

Since all three sisters are the same age, which is 16 years, their combined age is 16 * 3 = 48 years.

The combined age of the two brothers is 12 + 24 = 36 years.

Therefore, the total age of all the siblings is the sum of the combined age of the brothers and the combined age of the sisters, which is 48 + 36 = 84 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation. Since Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, the total daily meditation time is 30 minutes. Given that she meditates 7 days a week, the weekly meditation time is 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

Next, we calculate the time spent on yoga. Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, so the weekly yoga time is 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

Now, we sum the weekly meditation and yoga times to find the total time spent on these activities per week: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week.

To find the total time spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2040}$"
"To determine the total square feet of fabric used for the quilt, we need to calculate the total area covered by each type of t-shirt and then sum these values.

The area covered by small t-shirts is calculated as the product of the number of small shirts and the area of each small shirt: 11 small shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.

Similarly, the area covered by medium t-shirts is calculated as the product of the number of medium shirts and the area of each medium shirt: 8 medium shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.

"To determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake takes advantage of the buy one get one 50% off deal, he pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. The cost of the first T-shirt is $8, and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. Therefore, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's consider the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

"To determine the number of movie tickets Ryan can purchase, we must first calculate his total earnings from completing his chores and then subtract the expenses incurred for the ice cream cones.

Ryan's weekly allowance is $6, and he completed his chores for 3 weeks. Therefore, his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the ice cream cones. Since Ryan bought cones for himself and 3 friends, the total number of cones purchased is 4. Each cone costs $1.25, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, we can determine Ryan's remaining funds by subtracting the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings: $18 - $5 = $13.

Finally, we can calculate the number of movie tickets Ryan can purchase by dividing his remaining funds by the cost of a single ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

"To determine the profit made by Tim from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of producing the mix and then subtract it from the total revenue generated from selling the jars.

The cost of producing one jar of the mix consists of the costs of passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey. The cost of passion fruit is $6 per pound, and 2 pounds are required, resulting in a cost of 2 * $6 = $12. The cost of jackfruit is $8 per pound, and 1.5 pounds are required, resulting in a cost of 1.5 * $8 = $12. The cost of honey is $10 per pound, and 2 pounds are required, resulting in a cost of 2 * $10 = $20. Therefore, the total cost of producing one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

The selling price of one jar is $50. To find the profit from one jar, we subtract the cost from the selling price: $50 - $44 = $6.

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit from one jar by 10: $6 * 10 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on movie tickets. Since she purchased two tickets at $7.50 each, the total spent on tickets is 2 * $7.50 = $15.

Next, we add the cost of the ice cream, the movie tickets, and the bracelet to find the total amount spent: $3.50 (ice cream) + $15 (movie tickets) + $8.50 (bracelet) = $27.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her: $40 - $27 = $13.

Therefore, Janet has $13 left."
"To determine Josh's weekly earnings, we first need to calculate the number of days he is open. Since he is not open on Sundays and Wednesdays, he operates 5 days a week. 

In a week, Josh services 3 cars per day, so the total number of cars serviced in a week is 3 * 5 = 15 cars.

Given that Josh gets paid $4 per car, his weekly earnings are 15 * $4 = $60.

To find his earnings in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2: $60 * 2 = $120.

"To determine the current number of cookies Randy possesses, we must first calculate the initial total and then account for the changes in his cookie collection.

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. The total number of cookies he has at the beginning is the sum of these three quantities.

Total cookies initially = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18

Randy consumes 3 cookies for an early day snack, with one cookie of each flavor. This reduces his total by 3.

Randy then eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, further decreasing his total by 2.

Subsequently, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, which reduces his total by 2.

Lastly, Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, adding 12 cookies to his collection.

To find the current total, we subtract the cookies consumed or given away from the initial total and add the cookies baked.

Total cookies now = Total cookies initially - Cookies eaten or given away + Cookies baked
Total cookies now = 18 - (3 + 2 + 2) + 12
Total cookies now = 18 - 7 + 12
Total cookies now = 23

"To determine the total amount Matthew would earn from selling his collection of 12 unique toy soldiers, we need to calculate the revenue generated from the two different price points for the two halves of the collection.

Let's denote the number of toy soldiers in each half as n. Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, n = 12 / 2 = 6.

For the first half, he would receive 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30.

For the second half, he would receive 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.

To find the total amount, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

Therefore, the total amount Matthew would earn from selling his collection is $72.

"To determine the number of weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we first need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog. Given that the dog digs 6 holes per day and Nate is on vacation for 14 days, the total number of holes dug can be calculated as follows:

Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

However, since the dog continues to dig 6 new holes every night, we must account for these additional holes. Assuming Nate fills the holes for the same duration as his vacation, the total number of holes becomes:

Total holes = 84 (initial holes) + 84 (holes dug at night) = 168 holes

Next, we need to find the net number of holes filled per day. Nate fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, resulting in a net reduction of 3 holes per day.

Net holes filled per day = 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = 3 holes/day

Now, we can calculate the number of days required to fill all the holes:

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 holes / 3 holes/day = 56 days

Finally, to determine the number of weeks, we divide the total days by 7:

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 days / 7 days/week = 8 weeks

"To determine the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can express this relationship as a fraction of the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Let's denote the average enrollment at Norman High School as N. Then, the average enrollment at Butler High School can be expressed as (3/4)N.

We are given that the average enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students. Therefore, we can substitute this value into the expression for the average enrollment at Butler High School:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000 = 3000 students

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

Difference in enrollment = N - (3/4)N = (1/4)N
= (1/4) * 4000
= 1000

"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies made by the Adams family, we can utilize a simple arithmetic operation. Given that they have produced a total of 7995 cookies, with 2595 being rainbow cookies and 3075 being oatmeal cookies, we can calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies by subtracting the sum of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total.

First, we calculate the sum of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
2595 (rainbow cookies) + 3075 (oatmeal cookies) = 5670

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies:
7995 (total cookies) - 5670 (sum of rainbow and oatmeal cookies) = 2325

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

The final answer is: 2325"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationships between the items gathered by Igor and the total number of items on the lab bench.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P. We are given the following information:

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: T = 16 / 2 = 8.
2. Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: This statement is incorrect as it contradicts the first statement. However, we can infer that Igor gathered 2 fewer test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: T = P - 2.
3. Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: B = 7.
4. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29: T + B + P = 29.

From the first statement, we know T = 8. Substituting this into the equation from the fourth statement, we get:

8 + 7 + P = 29

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P = 29 - 8 - 7
P = 14

Now that we know P, we can find T using the second statement: T = P - 2 = 14 - 2 = 12.

However, this contradicts the first statement, which states that T = 8. This means the second statement is incorrect, and we should use the first statement to find T.

Now, let's substitute T = 8 into the equation from the fourth statement:

8 + 7 + P = 29

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P = 29 - 8 - 7
P = 14

Now that we know P, we can find the total number of items Igor gathered: T + B + P = 8 + 7 + 14 = 29.

However, we are told that Igor lost some beakers, so the total number of items he gathered is less than 29. Let's denote the number of beakers lost as L. Then, the total number of items Igor gathered is 8 + 7 - L + 14 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

29 = 29 - L

This equation is true for any value of L, but we know that L must be a non-negative integer. Since the number of beakers lost cannot be negative, we can try different values of L to find the correct answer.

However, we can also use the fact that the total number of items Igor gathered is 27 (8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 12 Petri dishes). This means that the number of beakers lost is 7 - (7 - L) = L.

Since the total number of items on the lab bench is 29, the number of beakers lost is 29 - 27 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we must first calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg necessitates 2 screws, resulting in a total of 8 screws per table.

Given that James is assembling 4 tables, the cumulative number of screws needed is 8 screws per table multiplied by 4 tables, which equals 32 screws.

Now, we can calculate the number of screws James will have left over by subtracting the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he possesses, which is 40 screws. Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is 40 - 32 = 8 screws.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"

Given that the second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket, and the first basket has 10 eggs, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket by multiplying the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Therefore, the second basket contains 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.

"To determine the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to calculate the individual contributions and then sum them.

Let's start by identifying the amount raised by each girl. Alexandra raises $430. Since Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, we can calculate Kim's contribution as $430 + $320 = $750.

Similarly, Sarah raises $300, and Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. Therefore, Maryam's contribution is $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we can calculate the total amount raised by adding the individual contributions: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances. Let's denote Aaron's speed as A and Vanessa's speed as V. We are given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so we can express this as A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. Since distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, we can express this as 2A = Vt, where t is the time it takes Vanessa to complete her part of the race.

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance of Vanessa (4 miles / 2 = 2 miles), we can set up the equation:

A * 2 = 16

Since A = 2V, we can substitute this into the equation:

2(2V) * 2 = 16

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4V * 2 = 16

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

V * 2 = 4

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

V = 2

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it takes her to complete her part of the race. Since distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, we can express this as:

Distance = Speed * Time

We know the distance is 4 miles and Vanessa's speed is 2 miles per minute. Rearranging the equation to solve for time, we get:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values, we get:

Time = 4 / 2

Time = 2

Therefore, Vanessa took 2 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount of line required for the dock, we must first establish the ratio of line to dock length. The caretaker desires 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Given that the dock is 200 feet in length, we can calculate the total line required by multiplying the dock length by the ratio.

200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already possesses 6 feet of new line. To find the amount he needs to purchase, we subtract the existing line from the total required:

600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{594}$"
"To determine the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we first need to calculate their daily revenue. Given that they receive 6 reservations per night and each reservation consists of 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine, we can calculate the daily revenue as follows:

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5) + $5 (bottle of wine) = (2 * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we can then calculate the weekly revenue by multiplying the daily revenue by the number of days they are open:

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * Number of days open = $15 * 2 = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to calculate the total revenue generated from selling all 50 watermelons. Given that the vendor sold them at a 25% profit, the selling price is 125% of the cost price.

Let's denote the cost price of one watermelon as 'x'. The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80, so we can express this as 50x = $80. Solving for 'x', we get x = $80 / 50 = $1.60.

Now, we can calculate the selling price of one watermelon. The selling price is 125% of the cost price, which is 1.25x. Substituting the value of 'x', we get the selling price as 1.25 * $1.60 = $2.

Therefore, the selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the current age of James, John's son. We are given that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This implies that Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, his current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

However, we are also given that John had James when he was 19. This information is inconsistent with the fact that James is currently 18 years old, as it would imply that John had James after he was 19. Therefore, we must disregard this information and focus on the relationship between James and Dora's ages.

We are also given that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. This implies that John's youngest son is currently 32 years younger than John. To find John's current age, we need more information. However, we can still determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years.

Let's denote John's current age as 'x'. Since John's youngest son is 32 years younger than John, his current age is x - 32. In 3 years, his age will be (x - 32) + 3.

However, we still need to find John's current age 'x'. Unfortunately, we do not have enough information to determine 'x'. But we can still express the age of John's youngest son in 3 years in terms of 'x': (x - 32) + 3.

Since we cannot determine the exact age of John's youngest son in 3 years without knowing John's current age, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, we can express the answer in terms of 'x'.

However, if we assume that the question is asking for a numerical answer and that John's age is not provided, we can consider the information given about James and Dora to be the primary information. In that case, we can ignore the information about John's age and the age of his youngest son.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of oranges Ana and Jane can peel in an hour, we first need to calculate their respective peeling rates. 

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her peeling rate is 1 orange per 3 minutes. In 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her peeling rate is 1 orange per 4 minutes. In 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total cost incurred by Mark, we first need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400. A discount of 80% off the original price can be calculated as 400 * 0.8 = $320. Therefore, the cost of the radiator after the discount is 400 - 320 = $80.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic works for 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour, resulting in a labor cost of 3 * 50 = $150.

The total cost incurred by Mark is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost, which is 80 + 150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation 2C + 4W = 70.

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the second equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

Therefore, the number of chickens on the farm is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
