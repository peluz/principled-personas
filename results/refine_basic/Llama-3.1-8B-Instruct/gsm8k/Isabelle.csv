"Let's break down Janet's daily egg sales. She lays 16 eggs per day. For breakfast, she eats 3 eggs, and she bakes 4 eggs for her friends. 

To find out how many eggs she has left, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 

So, she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To make a robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber required. It takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since the amount of white fiber needed is half that of the blue fiber, we calculate it as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts needed:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down Josh's house-flipping project. He initially bought the house for $80,000 and then invested $50,000 in repairs. This repair work increased the house's value by 150%.

To find the new value of the house, we need to calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value. 

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

Now, we add this to the original value: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

The total cost of the house is the original price plus the repairs: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

The final answer is: $70,000"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with James' running routine. 

To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon.

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"I'd be happy to help Kylar figure out how much he needs to pay for the glasses. 

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8, which is 0.6 * $1.8 = $1.08. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time. 

Let's find the pattern: 
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $3.
- The third glass costs $3 * 0.6 = $1.8.
- The fourth glass costs $1.8 * 0.6 = $1.08.
- The fifth glass costs $1.08 * 0.6 = $0.648.
- The sixth glass costs $0.648 * 0.6 = $0.3888.
- The seventh glass costs $0.3888 * 0.6 = $0.23328.
- The eighth glass costs $0.23328 * 0.6 = $0.139968.
- The ninth glass costs $0.139968 * 0.6 = $0.0839856.
- The tenth glass costs $0.0839856 * 0.6 = $0.05039136.
- The eleventh glass costs $0.05039136 * 0.6 = $0.030234816.
- The twelfth glass costs $0.030234816 * 0.6 = $0.0181407896.
- The thirteenth glass costs $0.0181407896 * 0.6 = $0.01088447476.
- The fourteenth glass costs $0.01088447476 * 0.6 = $0.006530684856.
- The fifteenth glass costs $0.006530684856 * 0.6 = $0.0039184109136.
- The sixteenth glass costs $0.0039184109136 * 0.6 = $0.00236104615456.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.648 + $0.3888 + $0.23328 + $0.139968 + $0.0839856 + $0.05039136 + $0.030234816 + $0.0181407896 + $0.01088447476 + $0.006530684856 + $0.0039184109136 + $0.00236104615456 = $23.016

The total cost is $23.016."
"Let's break down the information given:

Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB. The time to download 120 GB is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. The time to install the updates is 20 minutes. So, the total time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down John's trip into segments to find the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's consider the return trip. John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so the distance traveled during this time is 0 miles. Then, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

After that, he drives for the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

The total distance traveled in the return trip is 15 + 160 = 175 miles.

Now, let's find the total distance John traveled in the 4 hours. We add the distance traveled in the first 3 hours to the distance traveled in the return trip:

Total distance traveled = 180 + 175
Total distance traveled = 355 miles

Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles."
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 * $10 = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month, so we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"Let's calculate the total cost of the pastries Toula bought from the bakery.

First, we need to find the cost of 3 dozen donuts. Since 1 dozen donuts cost $68, 3 dozen will be 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, we calculate the cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes. Since 1 dozen mini cupcakes cost $80, 2 dozen will be 2 * $80 = $160.

Lastly, we find the cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes. Since 1 dozen mini cheesecakes cost $55, 6 dozen will be 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the initial cost of the lemon tree is $90. Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, generating a revenue of $10.5 per year. However, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year, resulting in a net revenue of $7.5 per year.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to calculate the time it takes for the tree to pay for itself. We can do this by dividing the initial cost by the net revenue:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.5 (net revenue) = 12 years

However, this calculation tells us when the tree will pay for itself, not when it starts earning money. Since the tree will start generating revenue in the first year, we can conclude that it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we need to find out how many she started with.

Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with ""x"". 

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she had (2/3)x vacuum cleaners left.

2. Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

3. After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2/3)x - 2 is (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = (1/3)x - 1.

4. So, she had ((2/3)x - 2) - ((1/3)x - 1) vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, which simplifies to (1/3)x - 1.

5. We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (1/3)x - 1 = 5.

6. To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: (1/3)x = 6.

7. Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a dance class of 20 students. First, 20% of them enrolled in contemporary dance. To find out how many students that is, we multiply 20 by 0.2.

20 * 0.2 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students to find out how many are left.

20 - 4 = 16 students

Next, 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. To find out how many students that is, we multiply 16 by 0.25.

16 * 0.25 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many enrolled in hip-hop dance.

16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine which purchase plan will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each option.

For the jewelry, a 2.5% increase in value would be 0.025 * $5,000 = $125.

For the electronic gadgets, a 1.2% increase in value would be 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Given these calculations, the jewelry option would result in a higher profit of $125."
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

Let's break it down step by step. We have two trains that leave San Rafael at the same time and travel in the same direction for the first day, which is westward. They cover a distance of 80 miles each.

The next day, they change direction and travel northward, covering 150 miles each.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem helps us find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.

In this case, the two sides of the right-angled triangle are the distances covered by the train on the first and second days. 

So, the total distance covered by each train is the square root of (80^2 + 150^2).

Calculating this, we get: √(6400 + 22500) = √28900 = 170 miles.

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles."
"Let's break down Jill's annual salary. 

First, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching. She gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked to get the total hours worked per year: 35 * 50 = 1750. Then, we multiply the total hours worked per year by her hourly wage: 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Next, we calculate her earnings from coaching. She gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Again, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked to get the total hours worked per year: 15 * 50 = 750. Then, we multiply the total hours worked per year by her hourly wage: 750 * $30 = $22,500.

Now, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching to get her total annual salary: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks and multiply it by the number of eggs she eats per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Claire eats 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down Marissa's hike. She's already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and another 2 miles in 1 hour, so she's covered a total of 6 miles in 2 hours.

To find the total time she needs to complete the hike, we can divide the total distance by her desired average speed:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since she's already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 10 liters of orange drink that is two-thirds water. To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Next, we have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling. The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

However, we spill 1 liter of the orange drink. To find the remaining amount of water, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water. The remaining amount of water is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Since we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Samantha is 31 years old, and Raymond was born 6 years before her. This means Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

We also know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to find the difference between Raymond's current age and the age when he had a son.

The difference between Raymond's current age (25) and the age when he had a son (23) is 25 - 23 = 2 years.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"Let's break down the number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday.

First, we have 3 customers who buy 1 DVD each, so they buy a total of 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.

Next, we have 2 customers who buy 2 DVDs each, so they buy a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Since the last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, we don't need to consider them in our calculation.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how much shorter a candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns for 4 hours, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that cost $3 each, and 4 apples that cost $1.50 each. We need to find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, given that each box costs $8.50 and she paid a total of $50.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples. The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 = $15, and the cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 = $6. 

Now, let's add these costs together: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. This is the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

Next, we need to find the cost of the pizza boxes. Since Marie paid a total of $50, we can subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from this amount: $50 - $33 = $17.

Now that we know the total cost of the pizza boxes is $17, we can find the number of boxes by dividing this amount by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's calculate the total amount Mishka spent on the clothing items.

First, we need to find the cost of each item. One pair of shorts costs $16.50, so 3 pairs of shorts will be 3 x $16.50 = $49.50. 

Next, one pair of pants costs $22.50, so 3 pairs of pants will be 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.

Lastly, one pair of shoes costs $42, so 3 pairs of shoes will be 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide 60 by 15:
60 / 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

"I'm happy to help you with Gloria's shoe shopping dilemma. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Gloria has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much as the first pair.

Since the more expensive pair of heels costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, we can calculate its cost as 2 * 33 = $66.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the situation: the cost of the boots (B) is equal to the sum of the costs of the two pairs of heels minus 5. So, B = 33 + 66 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

So, the boots cost $94."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"Let's break down the guesses. The first person thinks there are 80 jelly beans in the jar. The second person thinks there are 20 more than half of the first one, which is 40 + 20 = 60. The third person thinks there are 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100.

To find the average, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of people. The total number of guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. There are 3 people.

The average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Hello there. To find out how many hours John spends taking care of his dogs in a week, we need to calculate the total time he spends on them each day and then multiply that by 7.

First, let's find the total time John spends on his dogs daily. He has 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.

Total time per day = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Total time per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Now, we need to multiply the total time per day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7
Total time per week = 35 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We can express the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins as G = S + 30.

Since the total number of coins is 110, we can write the equation S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the information given to us about the jewels.

We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. To find out how many jewels Aaron has, we need to calculate half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5 to that number. Half of 40 is 20, and 20 + 5 is 25. So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

Now, we're told that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total. 25 - 2 is 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down Mike's ping pong game. He played for 40 minutes, which is divided into two 20-minute segments. 

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 

Now, let's calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. He scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which equals 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in that time frame. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Now, we need to figure out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. To do this, we divide the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per set: 60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Since each set costs $5.00, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set to find the total amount spent: 15 sets * $5.00 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many Lego sets John has left.

To start, let's calculate how much money John made from selling his Lego sets. He sold 13 sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 * 15 = 195 dollars

Next, we need to find out how much money John spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

John also had $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he spent is:
195 - 5 = 190 dollars

Now, let's find out how many Lego sets John sold to get $35 (the amount he spent from his own money). 
35 / 15 = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 11 sets with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time.
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to determine her walking and running speeds. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Given that her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can calculate her walking speed as 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's consider the time she spends walking and running. We know she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time she spends walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours, and the time she spends running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we need to consider the increased distance she can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

The original distance Polly can throw the javelin is 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther than that.

Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"Let's solve the problem together. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon. She cut each pie into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces.

The final answer is: 26"
"Hello there. Let's get to the problem at hand. You want to know how many grams of chips you can still eat from a 300g bag. 

First, we need to figure out how many calories you can still consume. Your daily target is 2000 calories, and you've already had 1800. So, let's subtract those two numbers: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Now, we know each serving of chips has 250 calories. To find out how many servings you can still have, we'll divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we'll multiply the number of servings you can still have by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's calculate Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles.

First, we need to find out how much it costs Charlie to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost of the beeswax is $20.00.

Next, we need to find out how much Charlie earns from selling 20 candles. Each candle sells for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is $40.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"Let's break down Meredith's writing schedule for the three days. 

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we need to calculate 2/5 of 5, which is 2. Then, we add this to the original number of articles, which is 5. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles written in the three days: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by the time it takes to write one article: 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She then purchased a package of Post-it notes and used 220 of them at work. After that, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to determine the total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package. We can do this by adding the initial Post-it notes and the ones she purchased, then subtracting the ones she used.

Let's call the number of Post-it notes in the package 'x'. The total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package is 80 (initial) + x (package) - 220 (used) + 23 (remaining).

Since the total Post-it notes after purchasing the package is equal to the sum of the initial Post-it notes, the Post-it notes used, and the Post-it notes remaining, we can set up the equation:

x + 23 = 80 + 220 - 23

Simplifying the equation:
x + 23 = 277 - 23
x + 23 = 254
x = 254 - 23
x = 231

The final answer is: 231"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie: 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. We know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the red ties cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

To find the total cost of red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie: 10 * 60 = $600.

Finally, we add the cost of blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces of wire Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply 4 feet by 12 to get the total length in inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. There are 15 floors and 8 units per floor, so the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: 120 units * 1/4 = 30 units.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Lloyd makes from his egg farm per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week:
Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily production by 7:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens are produced per week:
1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"Let's break down Tom's journey. He travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is a 3-hour period. Since his ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, the distance covered during this time is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

Now, let's calculate the time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour. It's simply 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

For the return journey, the distance remains the same, 30 miles. However, his ship's speed is now 6 mph. To find the time taken for the return journey, we divide the distance by the speed: 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, the total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours (one way) + 5 hours (return journey) = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, and he removes 30 of them. To find the total weight of the comic books, we multiply the weight of one comic book by the number of comic books: 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can calculate the number of toys by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy. The remaining weight is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. So, we divide 7.5 by 0.5 to get the number of toys: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the revenue earned from repairing truck tires and car tires on Thursday. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire.

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Next, we need to calculate the revenue earned from repairing car tires on Friday. Since no truck tires were repaired, we only need to consider the car tires.

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480

Now, let's compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"Oh my goodness, I'm so excited to help with this problem. My mom just called and told me that our two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens. We already have 7 adorable kittens from the animal shelter that we adopted. 

Let's see, Patchy has had three times as many kittens as the ones we adopted, which is 3 * 7 = 21 kittens. And Trixie has had 12 kittens.

So, if we add up all the kittens, we have 7 (the ones we adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40 kittens.

"Let's break down the information given. We have a total of 25 oranges in the basket. Out of these, 1 is bad, and 20% are unripe. We also know that 2 are sour.

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges. 20% of 25 oranges is calculated as (20/100) * 25 = 5 oranges.

Now, we add the number of bad and unripe oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

Since we know that 2 oranges are sour, we can add these to the number of oranges that are not good to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 
6 (not good) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges are not good.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges are good.

"Let's break down Marcy's pension situation. She works for 30 years, but she only gets the full pension for the first 20 years. After that, she gets 5% of the value of the pension for the remaining 10 years.

The full pension for 20 years is 20 years * $50,000/year = $1,000,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension, which is 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000/year.

So, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000/year for the first 20 years and $50,000/year for the remaining 10 years. However, since the question asks for the annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the 10 years of 5% of the pension value. 

The annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000/year.

"Let's break down Jim's activities. He spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long, which is 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour. So, in one day, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent on TV and reading in one week is 3 hours * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 9 hours * 4 = 36 hours.

However, this is not the final answer. We need to consider that he spends 3 days a week doing this activity, but the question asks for the time spent in 4 weeks. So, we need to multiply the time spent in one week by 4/3 to account for the extra week: 9 hours * (4/3) = 12 hours.

"Let's calculate the total amount Artie will make from his flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. The prices for each type of flower are $2.74 per pot for marigolds, $1.87 per pot for petunias, and $2.12 per pot for begonias.

To make things easier, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar. Marigolds will be $3 per pot, petunias will be $2 per pot, and begonias will be $2 per pot.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Artie will make from each type of flower. He sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias.

Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the amounts together to find the total:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"I'm Isabelle, and I'd be happy to help you with your question about Luke's sandcastle.

To find the average square footage of a level, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level will have half the square footage of the top level, which is 16 / 2 = 8.
The third level will have half the square footage of the second level, which is 8 / 2 = 4.
The fourth level will have half the square footage of the third level, which is 4 / 2 = 2.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in that time.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, let's find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost per flower for each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the grooming is $100. To find 30% of this amount, we multiply it by 0.3.

30% of $100 = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the cost after the discount.

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

So, the cost of the grooming after the discount is $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. To find out how much water they got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters.

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Next, a boy got 6 liters of water. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy. 
Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

Now, let's subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water. 
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down Charlie's sticker situation step by step.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. Then, he bought 21 more from a store, bringing his total to 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

Next, he received 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

After that, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, which means he now has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times what Grace weighs and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. 

4 times what Grace weighs is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

To find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"Let's count the thorns on those lovely rose bushes. Dan has 3 rose bushes, and each one has 25 beautiful roses. Now, each of those roses has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75
Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's break down the problem. We know the football team played a total of 22 games. We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost. 

Let's denote the number of games they lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We can set up two equations based on this information: W = L + 8 and W + L = 22.

We can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7

Now that we know L, we can find W: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

So, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

He goes on 4 vacations per year, so the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"Let's break down the information given. The alarm rings three times a day, and each time it goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 10% increase for 5 years, and then calculate the salary for the next 3 years.

The initial salary is $600. An increase of 10% of $600 is $60. So, the salary after 5 years is $600 + ($60 * 5) = $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

The increase for the next year is 10% of $900, which is $90. So, the salary after 6 years is $900 + $90 = $990. 

For the next year, the increase is 10% of $990, which is $99. So, the salary after 7 years is $990 + $99 = $1089.

For the next year, the increase is 10% of $1089, which is $109.1. So, the salary after 8 years is $1089 + $109.1 = $1198.1.

For the next year, the increase is 10% of $1198.1, which is $119.81. So, the salary after 9 years is $1198.1 + $119.81 = $1317.91.

The final answer is: $1317.91"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we denote the number of copies Harald sold as H, then the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help Christina plan her birthday party. To determine how much she'll spend on gift bags, we need to figure out how many guests will actually attend. Since 1/4 of the guests won't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

16 (total guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

"Let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the dinosaur picnic. 

First, we need to find out how much the adults will eat. Since there are 20 adults and each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad, we multiply the number of adults by the amount each adult eats: 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much the children will eat. Since each child eats half as much as an adult, we multiply the number of children by half of the amount an adult eats: 5 * (10 / 2) = 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the amount eaten by adults and children to find the total amount of potato salad needed: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's break down the information given:

Cindy has 4 pets. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Now, we know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. To find the number of pets Jan has, we multiply the number of pets Marcia has by 3: 3 * 6 = 18.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. It's also mentioned that Lee runs two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles. 

To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time. So, Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, we're told that Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find the time it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles after his diet change, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time. 

10% of 40 is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds. 

Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 must be girls.

Total students = 200
Boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given: there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, and 5 of them took an exit. This means that 25 cars drove through the traffic jam. We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20. Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jerome had 4 friends visiting him, and we need to find the total number of doorbell rings.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we multiply 20 by 1/4, which is 5, and then add it to 20. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. We know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

"To find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to know the rate at which it covers the city and the total distance of the city.

The fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. We can use this information to find out how many 3-mile sections are in the city. The city is 42 miles across, so we can divide 42 by 3 to find the number of sections.

42 / 3 = 14

This means there are 14 sections of 3 miles each in the city. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we can multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 * 10 = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. To find the inner volume of the boxes, we need to calculate the volume of the inner space of each box and then multiply it by the number of boxes.

Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. To find the inner dimensions, we subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. 

The length of the box is 5 inches, so the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

The width of the box is 6 inches, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of the box is 4 inches, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"Let's break down Frankie's TV-watching schedule. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes. That's 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. We need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched. Let's call the number of episodes x. Since each episode is 0.5 hours, the total time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Wednesday is 0.5x.

On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours of 1-hour and 30-minute episodes. This is 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours for a 30-minute episode. 

On Friday, he watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes.

The total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. The time spent watching 30-minute episodes is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

"Let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice. 

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so the total number of roll-ups she ate is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of rowing in feet per second: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

Now, let's divide the total time by the rate to find the total distance rowed: 64 seconds / 1.25 feet/second = 51.2 feet.

Since we are only interested in sets of 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10: 51.2 feet / 10 = 5.12 sets.

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2: 5.12 sets * 2 liters/set = 10.24 liters.

3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sasha has leftover lumber that she bought at a certain price, and now she wants to sell it after the prices have gone up by 50%. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each, so the total cost of these boards is 10 * $10 = $100. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each, so the total cost of these boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. So, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each, and the new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards, so the total revenue from these boards is 10 * $15 = $150. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards, so the total revenue from these boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the fraction of the total mixture that is sugar. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.

The fraction of the total mixture that is sugar is 7/20. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we can multiply this fraction by the total amount of the mixture (120): (7/20) * 120 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the shoes for one child. Since each pair costs $60, the cost for one child is 2 pairs * $60 = $120.

Now, we multiply this by the number of children to get the total cost: $120 * 3 = $360.

The final answer is: $360"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there were initially 2 containers with 5 vehicles each at the port. This means the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles imported on the second day by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's salary. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago was 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Four years later, both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased by 40%. To find Adrien's new salary, we need to calculate 40% of his old salary and add it to his old salary. 40% of $40000 is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. So, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of her old salary. 40% of $28000 is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. So, Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

The final answer is: $95200"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first find out how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. So, he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets of paper a week.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, to find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4: 60 * 4 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's break down the problem. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

To find the total number of fruits Morisette brought, we add the number of apples and oranges: 5 + 8 = 13. To find the total number of fruits Kael brought, we add the number of apples and oranges: 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, let's add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought together: 13 + 14 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48

"Let's break down Rosie's running distance into two parts. First, she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find the distance she covers in this time, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find out how much time is left for her to run at 5 miles per hour. We subtract the time she already ran from the total time:

Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Next, we calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour:

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jennie is helping at her mom's office. She has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and a pile of letters already stamped. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we need to find out how many were in that pile when Jennie began.

Let's start by finding out how many letters Jennie stamped. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she must have stamped 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters.

Now, we know that after stamping 20 letters, the number of letters needing stamps is 60 - 20 = 40. However, we are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 20 letters Jennie stamped were added to the pile of already-stamped letters.

To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to subtract the number of letters she stamped from the current number of letters in the pile. So, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From point 2, we know that Julia had 'x' spoons initially. 
From point 3, we know that after using 3 spoons, Julia had 'x - 3' spoons left.
From point 4, we know that after her husband gave her 5 more spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. 

So, we can set up the equation: x - 3 + 5 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Lily made 50 friends. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, we can find the number of friends Amy made by adding 20 to Lily's total.

Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we add the number of friends each of them has: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Dillon will spend at the store.

First, we need to determine the cost of each item. We know that each pepper costs $15. 

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, we can calculate its price by multiplying the cost of a pepper by 3. So, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we know that an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon. Therefore, the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item. Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180. He buys 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers is 20 * $15 = $300. Finally, he buys 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges together: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the hospital's profit, we first need to determine the total time spent by doctors. Since each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, we multiply the number of patients by the average time per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Now, we convert the total minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Next, we calculate the total revenue for the hospital. We multiply the number of patients by the hourly rate charged to the patients and then convert the result to hours.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour = 2000 * $200/hour = $400000

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $400000 - $30000
Profit = $370000

The final answer is: $370000"
"Let's calculate the number of elves left after the chaos in the Santa village.

First, we need to find out how many elves quit after the kids' mishaps. A third of the 60 elves is 60 / 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit.

Now, we subtract the ones who quit from the total: 60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Then, 10 more elves quit after the kids kicked their shins. So, we subtract those 10 from the remaining elves: 40 - 10 = 30 elves are left.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June.

Expenditure in May is $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less, so the expenditure in June is $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, let's add the expenditures for the two months: $500 + $440 = $940.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, we can find the total number of tickets used by multiplying the total number of rides by the cost per ride: 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down Walt's walking miles. On Monday, he walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total. 

41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

"Hello there, I'm Isabelle. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many video games Bobby has.

To start, we need to know how many video games Brian has after losing 5. Brian initially had 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Now, let's find out how many video games Bobby has. Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply Brian's remaining video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times Brian's remaining video games is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

So, Bobby has 40 video games."

"Let's break down Rory's delivery order. She orders 2 subs for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each, and 2 cookies for $1.00 each. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee to the total cost of the items. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20:
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
- Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total cost with the delivery fee:
- Total cost with delivery fee and tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mark took a test with 75 questions and another test with 100 questions. He completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete it. Since he completes 5 questions per hour, he would have completed 8 * 5 = 40 questions in that time. However, he only completed 40 questions out of 75, so he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete it. At a rate of 5 questions per hour, he would have completed 6 * 5 = 30 questions in that time. However, he only completed 30 questions out of 100, so he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests: 35 + 70 = 105.

The final answer is: 105"

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars.

We know that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total.

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's break down the information given. We know there are 700 bees in total, and the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, while the number of baby bees is twice the number of queens.

Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We can express the relationship between the number of worker bees and baby bees as W = 2B. We can also express the relationship between the number of baby bees and queens as B = 2Q.

Since the total number of bees is 700, we can write the equation W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q into the equation, we get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Since B = 2Q, we have B = 2(100) = 200.

Since W = 2B, we have W = 2(200) = 400.

So, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

"Hello there. Let's break down John's shopping list to find the total cost. 

First, we have the food items: milk for 2 dollars and eggs for 3 dollars. The total cost of food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

Next, we have the non-food items: light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. The total cost of non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Since there's a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount. To do that, we multiply 10 dollars by 0.1, which equals 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much profit Kim will make each week.

Kim has a total of 8 clients, which includes 3 current clients and 5 potential clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths for cleaning.

To find the total number of bottles of bleach needed, we multiply the number of clients by the number of bottles each client requires: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles.

Similarly, to find the total number of packs of cloths needed, we multiply the number of clients by the number of packs each client requires: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of bleach and cloths. The cost of bleach per bottle is $2, so the total cost of bleach is 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32. The cost of cloths per pack is $5, so the total cost of cloths is 8 packs * $5/pack = $40.

The total expenses per week are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20.

"Hello there. Let's calculate how many pineapples John can harvest within a year.

First, we need to find out how many pineapples John has in total. Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare and John has 10 hectares, we multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of hectares:
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Now, we need to determine how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Debra's beehive problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 that many bees return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.

Now, let's consider the bees that have left the hive so far. We have the initial 30 bees that left, and 15 of them returned. That means 30 - 15 = 15 bees have not returned yet.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.

Now, let's consider the total number of bees that have left the hive so far. We have the initial 30 bees that left, and 60 more bees left in the last 6 hours. That makes a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees that have left the hive.

However, we know that 15 bees from the initial 30 had not returned yet. So, the number of bees that have not returned yet is 15 (from the initial 30) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 30 bees return.

Let's break it down step by step. The cost of admission to the museum is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket. 

The total cost of the tickets is the sum of the cost of the adult ticket and the child ticket. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up an equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has ""x"". Then, Charlie has 3x friends.

We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

Steve lives 3 miles away from the school and can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school and can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, Steve's distance is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet, and Tim's distance is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home. Time is equal to distance divided by speed.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 15840 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 36 minutes

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 36
Difference in time = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Shawnda is offering a bike inflation service, and she charges 25 cents per tire. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated. 5 people came by on bicycles, and each bicycle has 2 tires, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 bicycle tires. Then, 3 people came by on tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tricycle tires. Finally, 1 person came by on a unicycle, which has 1 tire.

Now, let's add up the total number of tires: 10 bicycle tires + 9 tricycle tires + 1 unicycle tire = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is 20 * 25 cents = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies inside. To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack.

Number of packs: 10
Cookies per pack: 6

Total number of cookies: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Now, we need to find the total cost of the cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie.

Total cost: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill.

Change = $10 - $6 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially. 
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 14 (by Dave) + 7 (by seagull) = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. 
   After the pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries were left. The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   We can simplify this to (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   We can solve for x by first adding 1 to both sides: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Then, multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18.
   Finally, add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"Let's calculate the total length of the baked goods Bill bakes every day. 

First, we need to find the total length of each type of baked good. Since each roll is 4 inches long, we multiply the number of rolls by the length of each roll: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.

Next, we calculate the total length of the croissants. Each croissant is 6 inches long, so we multiply the number of croissants by the length of each croissant: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

Now, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long. Then, we multiply the number of baguettes by the length of each baguette: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches.

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together: 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12: 3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape per month and then multiply it by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Blake and Kelly are running on a 100-yard football field. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means he covers a distance of 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Now, let's calculate Kelly's distance. She runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards, Blake is the winner. To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's calculate the total amount Raphael spent on school supplies.

First, we need to find the cost of the pens. Since he bought 4 pens at $1.5 each, the total cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks. Raphael bought 2 notebooks at $4 each, so the total cost of the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $8.

Finally, we need to add the cost of the bond paper, which is $20.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the tank had a depth of 17 feet on Monday. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Now, we need to find the depth of the water on Wednesday, which is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To do this, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"Hello there. I'm Isabelle. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of fish each of them caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you calculate the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

To start, let's break down the problem into manageable chunks. We'll calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20. 

After 2 months, the price will be:
Price = Initial price + (Initial price * Increase percentage)
= $20 + ($20 * 0.20)
= $20 + $4
= $24

After 4 months, the price will be:
Price = $24 + ($24 * 0.20)
= $24 + $4.80
= $28.80

We'll continue this process for the next 32 months, calculating the price every two months.

After 6 months, the price will be:
Price = $28.80 + ($28.80 * 0.20)
= $28.80 + $5.76
= $34.56

After 8 months, the price will be:
Price = $34.56 + ($34.56 * 0.20)
= $34.56 + $6.912
= $41.472

After 10 months, the price will be:
Price = $41.472 + ($41.472 * 0.20)
= $41.472 + $8.2944
= $49.7664

After 12 months, the price will be:
Price = $49.7664 + ($49.7664 * 0.20)
= $49.7664 + $9.95328
= $59.71968

After 14 months, the price will be:
Price = $59.71968 + ($59.71968 * 0.20)
= $59.71968 + $11.943736
= $71.663416

After 16 months, the price will be:
Price = $71.663416 + ($71.663416 * 0.20)
= $71.663416 + $14.3326832
= $85.9960992

After 18 months, the price will be:
Price = $85.9960992 + ($85.9960992 * 0.20)
= $85.9960992 + $17.19921984
= $103.19531904

After 20 months, the price will be:
Price = $103.19531904 + ($103.19531904 * 0.20)
= $103.19531904 + $20.639063608
= $123.834382648

After 22 months, the price will be:
Price = $123.834382648 + ($123.834382648 * 0.20)
= $123.834382648 + $24.7668765296
= $148.6012591776

After 24 months, the price will be:
Price = $148.6012591776 + ($148.6012591776 * 0.20)
= $148.6012591776 + $29.72025183552
= $178.32151101312

After 26 months, the price will be:
Price = $178.32151101312 + ($178.32151101312 * 0.20)
= $178.32151101312 + $35.664302202624
= $214.985813215744

After 28 months, the price will be:
Price = $214.985813215744 + ($214.985813215744 * 0.20)
= $214.985813215744 + $42.9971624431488
= $257.9829756588928

After 30 months, the price will be:
Price = $257.9829756588928 + ($257.9829756588928 * 0.20)
= $257.9829756588928 + $51.59659513177856
= $309.5795707906712

After 32 months, the price will be:
Price = $309.5795707906712 + ($309.5795707906712 * 0.20)
= $309.5795707906712 + $61.91581415813424
= $371.49538494880544

After 34 months, the price will be:
Price = $371.49538494880544 + ($371.49538494880544 * 0.20)
= $371.49538494880544 + $74.299076989761088
= $445.794461938566528

After 36 months, the price will be:
Price = $445.794461938566528 + ($445.794461938566528 * 0.20)
= $445.794461938566528 + $89.1588923877133056

"Hello there. Let's calculate the total worth of the toys in the room. We have 5 red cars, each costing $4, 3 action figures, each costing $5, and a doll that costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, let's find the cost of the doll. Since it costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of toy:
- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

To find the total worth of all the toys, we add the costs together: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"Let's break down the situation. If Jackie decides to do her taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, which means she'll lose $35 per hour in missed income. To find out how much she'll lose, we multiply the number of hours by her hourly rate:

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour
= $105

Now, let's consider the cost of hiring an accountant, which is $90. To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the income she'll lose to the cost of hiring the accountant. Since the income lost is greater than the cost of hiring the accountant, Jackie will actually be better off hiring the accountant.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:
Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we denote Brooke's current age as B, then Seth's current age is 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and 2B + 2. The sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write an equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"

To find the total miles walked from Monday to Friday, we multiply 20 miles by 5 days: 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

For the weekends, we multiply 10 miles by 2 days: 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Let's break down the time it takes Billy to peel and cut the potatoes. 

First, we need to find the time it takes to peel one potato, which is 1.5 minutes. To find the time it takes to cut one potato, we convert 5 seconds to minutes, which is 5/60 minutes.

Now, we multiply the time it takes to peel one potato by the total number of potatoes (60) to get the total time to peel all potatoes: 60 * 1.5 minutes = 90 minutes.

Next, we multiply the time it takes to cut one potato by the total number of potatoes: 60 * (5/60) minutes = 5 minutes.

Finally, we add the total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons.

First, we need to find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, the total revenue per gallon is:
20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

Since they made a profit of $25, their total revenue is the sum of the profit and the cost. Let's call the total cost 'x'. Then, the total revenue is:
Total revenue = Profit + Cost
Total revenue = $25 + x

Since they sell each gallon for $10, the number of gallons they sold is:
Total revenue = Number of gallons * $10/gallon
$25 + x = Number of gallons * $10/gallon

Now, let's solve for the number of gallons:
Number of gallons = ($25 + x) / $10

The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The cost of sugar per gallon is $2, so the cost of lemons per gallon is:
Cost of lemons per gallon = $5 - $2 = $3

The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:
Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 * (($25 + x) / $10)

Since we are given that the total profit is $25, we can set up the equation:
Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$10 * Number of gallons - ($3 * Number of gallons) - ($2 * Number of gallons) = $25
$10 * (($25 + x) / $10) - $5 * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25

Simplifying the equation:
(10 - 5) * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
5 * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
(25 + x) / 2 = $25
25 + x = $50
x = $25

Now that we have the total cost, we can find the cost of lemons:
Total cost = $25
Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
Total cost of lemons = $25

The final answer is: $25"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know there are a total of 240 participants in the race, out of which 80 are Japanese. To find the number of Chinese participants, we subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants.

Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we're told that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

"Let's break down Zaid's expenses step by step.

First, Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. To find this amount, we multiply his monthly salary by 1/4: 6000 * 1/4 = 600.

Next, he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. To find this amount, we multiply his monthly salary by 1/3: 6000 * 1/3 = 2000.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel: 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400.

Zaid then donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. To find this amount, we multiply the remaining amount by 1/2: 3400 * 1/2 = 1700.

After the donation, the remaining amount is: 3400 - 1700 = 1700.

Next, Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars. The total amount given to his family members is: 200 + 700 = 900.

Finally, let's calculate the amount Zaid has left: 1700 - 900 = 800.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can find Monic's number of crabs by subtracting 4 from Bo's total: 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Now, we know that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. To find Rani's total, we add 10 to Monic's total: 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for the first and second weeks together:
$50 + $80 = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the number of votes the winner got. The winner got 3/4 of the total votes, which is 3/4 * 80 = 60 votes.

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is 80 - 60 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations and 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write the equation 5x = 200. 

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40. 
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can write an equation to represent the situation two years ago:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * Jan's age two years ago + 5
Since Jan is 30, two years ago Jan was 28. 
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * 28 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19

Now, we know Mark's age two years ago was 19. To find Mark's current age, we add 2 to this:
Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:
Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down the information given. We have two teams competing in a 4 by 400 meter relay. The well-rounded team has four members, each running their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. The less well-rounded team's first runner runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the total time for the well-rounded team and the less well-rounded team. The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

Now, let's calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team. Their first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a six-sided die, which means there are 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The favorable outcomes for this are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 total outcomes, making the probability 3/6 or 1/2, which is equivalent to 50%.

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the die is rolled again, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Since these events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. 

50% - 25% = 25%

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Let's figure out how many apples Jenna and her mom picked. We know that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. Her mom picked 20 apples, so to find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to divide 20 by 2.

20 / 2 = 10

So, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Hello there. I'm Isabelle, and I'm happy to help you with your question. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store.

First, let's calculate the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters. Since there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Next, we know that the rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

Now, let's add the number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits. 50 + 20 = 70.

We are told that a total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. Since 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

The total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100. 
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $100 + $2 = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $102 + $2.04 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of buying and transporting the bags. The cost of buying each bag is $20, and the cost of transporting each bag is $2. So, the total cost for 'x' bags is $20x + $2x = $22x.

Next, we know that the trader made a profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each. This means the total revenue from selling the bags is the total cost plus the profit, which is $22x + $400.

Since the total revenue is also equal to the number of bags sold multiplied by the selling price, we can set up the equation:
$30x = $22x + $400

Now, let's solve for 'x'. Subtracting $22x from both sides of the equation gives us:
$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"Let's break down the costs of the outing. The three friends spent $20.25 on tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, which means they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the tickets, food, and rides: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is $34."
"Hello there. Let's calculate how many peaches John collects in 3 hours. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes he collects peaches. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so for 3 hours, he collects for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the number of peaches per minute by the total minutes: 
2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"Hello there. To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects they require per week. Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply this by the number of ducks in the flock.

Total pounds of insects per week = 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Now, to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day, we divide the total pounds of insects per week by 7 (the number of days in a week).

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 trees a year. He also chops down 2 trees a year. To find the net change in the number of trees, we need to subtract the trees he chops down from the trees he plants: 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. So, after 10 years, Tom has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

Now, we subtract the trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's break down the events step by step to find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help Violetta with her crayon purchase. 

To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color.

Total number of crayons she can buy = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons she can buy = 10

Now, to find out how much change she will get, we need to subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has.

Total cost of crayons = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 * $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. We can do this by multiplying the cost of a single pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"Hello there. Let's calculate how many pounds of carrots will not be used.

We have 200 pounds of carrots to be distributed to 40 restaurants. Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. 

To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed. 

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, let's subtract the total pounds distributed from the initial amount:

Initial amount = 200 pounds
Total pounds distributed = 80 pounds
Pounds not used = Initial amount - Total pounds distributed = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds

"Hello there, trainer! I'm Isabelle, the friendly assistant from the Pokémon Center. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Let's see... Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, so that's 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Now, let's calculate the number of cards she collected in the third month. She collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Since Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

The total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.

The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"Let's break down John's situation. He wins an award with a $5000 monetary reward and a 5% raise in salary. His current weekly salary is $2000, and he works every week of the year.

First, we need to calculate the 5% raise:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = 100
New salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John works 52 weeks a year, we'll multiply his new salary by the number of weeks:
Total amount made that year = New salary * Number of weeks
= 2100 * 52
= 109200

However, we also need to add the $5000 monetary reward to this total:
Total amount made that year = 109200 + 5000
= 114200

The total amount John made that year is $114200."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Josie has a 10-acre farm, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. To find the total tons of grapes produced per year, we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes per acre:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Now, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. To find the total number of barrels of wine produced per year, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels per ton:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Let's break down Carl's cheese usage for the week. He ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used a total of 7 * 2 = 14 slices for his sandwiches.

For breakfast, Carl had cheese and egg omelets for 3 days. He used one more slice of cheese per omelet than per sandwich, which means he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for the 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for his omelets.

In addition to his sandwiches and omelets, Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that used 8 slices of cheese.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. To find the total number of pens she had initially, we add these two numbers together: 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Next, we need to find out how many pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the number of blue and red pens she bought: 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Brinley's math problem. To find the score she needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Since Brinley needs a total score of 558 for the semester, we need to find the score she needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

"Let's break down Michael's bike riding into two periods. In the first period, he rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks, covering a distance of 25 kilometers each time. 

To find the total distance covered in this period, we multiply the number of kilometers per ride by the number of rides per week and then by the number of weeks: 25 kilometers * 5 rides/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

In the second period, Michael reduced his rides to 2 times a week but increased the distance to 60 kilometers each time. He rode like this for 3 weeks. To find the total distance covered in this period, we multiply the new number of kilometers per ride by the new number of rides per week and then by the number of weeks: 60 kilometers * 2 rides/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, let's add the total kilometers for both periods to find the overall distance covered: 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Joe's bag of Halloween candy contains 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and it's mentioned that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of a candied apple by dividing the weight of a chocolate bar by 2. So, the weight of a candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

Now, we can find the total weight of the chocolate bars by multiplying the number of chocolate bars by their individual weight: 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Next, we find the total weight of the candied apples by multiplying the number of candied apples by their individual weight: 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"Let's break down Sara's situation. She wants to buy a jacket that costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes that cost $20 each. The total cost of the items she wants to buy is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

To find out how much more money she needs to earn, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost of the items: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's solve the problem. We know that Jerry has a certain number of red chickens and white chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, we need to find out how many red chickens he has.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We can set up an equation based on the total number of eggs collected:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Day 1: 100 customers
- Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total by Day 3: 500 customers

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

"Let's dive into the problem. We have two pools, both leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool four minutes ago is 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at the same rate, the total amount of water leaked from both pools in four minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, let's consider the current situation. The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 gallons (since 4 gallons leaked out). The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 4 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water four minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. 

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Lori's hourly wage is $8.00. 

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

The final answer is: 44"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she needs to pay a total of $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (10% of $2000) = $2200.

Now, let's calculate how much she will pay in 12 months. She pays $165 per month, so in 12 months, she will pay a total of $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we need to subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount she owes. So, the remaining balance is $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"Let's count the flowers in the vase. There are 4 roses in the vase. We also know that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. To find the number of dahlias, we add 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then add 3 to each age.

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Naomi scored 68 points in the board game. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. To find out how many points Yuri scored, we need to calculate half of Naomi's points first. Half of 68 is 34. 

Now, we add 10 to that to find out Yuri's points: 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we add 17 to Naomi's points: 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now that we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna, we can find out the total points they scored together: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out Jojo's points by subtracting the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is: 54"

"Let's solve this problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. To do this, we subtract 90 from the initial 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Now, we know that Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply the remaining water by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

The amount of rainwater collected is 60 liters. To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the remaining water and the collected rainwater.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final answer is: 90"
"Hello there. To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, let's start with the geraniums. Andy plants 90 of them. Now, we know he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, the number of petunias is 90 - 40 = 50.

Now, let's add the number of geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140.

"Hello there, trainer! I'm Isabelle, the friendly assistant from the Pokémon world. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Let's see... James has 30 fire-type Pokémon cards, 20 grass-type cards, and 40 water-type cards. If he loses 8 of the water-type cards and buys 14 grass-type cards, I can help you figure out the percentage chance of picking a water-type card at random.

First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes. We subtract the 8 water-type cards he lost and add the 14 grass-type cards he bought.

Water-type cards: 40 - 8 = 32
Total cards: 90 - 8 + 14 = 96

Now, let's calculate the percentage chance of picking a water-type card:
(32 / 96) * 100 = 33.333...%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33.

So, the correct answer is: **33**"
"Let's break down Chad's order step by step. The base burrito costs $6.50. He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. The total cost of the extra items is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50. 

The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00. Chad decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. However, he has a gift card for $5.00 that he uses at checkout. To find out how much he still owes, we subtract the gift card amount from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after two weeks.

First, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, so we multiply 120 by 0.3 to get the number of ready watermelons.

120 * 0.3 = 36 watermelons

Now, we subtract the number of ready watermelons from the total to find the number of remaining watermelons.

120 - 36 = 84 watermelons

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready, so we multiply 84 by 0.75 to get the number of ready watermelons.

84 * 0.75 = 63 watermelons

Finally, we subtract the number of ready watermelons from the remaining watermelons to find the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks.

84 - 63 = 21 watermelons

"Let's break down the costs for Mark's fleet of cars.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars. Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each, so the total cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the cars. Mark pays 10% tax on the total cost of the cars, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Then, we need to calculate the registration fee for the cars. Mark pays $1000 for each car, so the total registration fee is 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fee: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

So, Dax went to their farm to pick some apples and found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. If there were 50 ants, let's figure out the total number of insects in the garden.

Since there were half as many bugs as ants, we can find the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects.

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

"Hello there, I'm Isabelle. Let's dive into the problem at hand. We have 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow. Now, one-third of them decide to jump in and swim in the ocean, and another one-third go inside the cave to enjoy their dinner.

To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we need to calculate how many penguins jumped in the ocean and went inside the cave. One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. So, 12 penguins jumped in the ocean and 12 penguins went inside the cave.

In total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the sunbathing area.

Now, let's subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 
36 - 24 = 12

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total tomatoes he eats per week: 
6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. 
So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day. 
His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week. Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find the number of vines needed: 
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

First, we need to determine the total number of slices required. Since there are 20 friends and each friend should have 4 slices, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices per friend.

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Now, we need to find out how many pizzas are needed to get 80 slices. Since each pizza has 8 slices, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza.

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Ram buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low. He can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens. 

First, let's find out how many new pens he can make from the ink of the 25 pens he buys. To do this, we divide 25 by 5, which equals 5. This means he can make 5 new pens from the ink of the first 25 pens.

Now, he has 5 empty pens left. He can use the ink from these 5 pens to make 1 new pen.

So, the total number of pens he gets is 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens from the first 25 pens) + 1 (new pen from the 5 empty pens) = 31 pens.

$30 * 3 = $90

So, after a year, Johnny has $90."
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Jessa is 20 years old. We also know that Joan is five years older than Jessa, and Mary is two years younger than Joan.

Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can find Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25.

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. To find Mary's age, we subtract 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23.

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages by adding them together: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the school hall. We know that 30% of the students went out through exit A. To find the number of students who left through exit A, we calculate 30% of 1000.

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left in the hall. We subtract the number of students who left through exit A from the total number of students.

Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

Next, we're told that 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find the number of students who left through exit B, we calculate 3/5 of 700.

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left in the hall after some went out through exit B. We subtract the number of students who left through exit B from the remaining students.

Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280

Finally, we need to find out how many students went out through exit C. Since the rest of the students went out through exit C, we can say that the number of students who went out through exit C is equal to the remaining students.

280 students went out through exit C.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. This means he's left with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Each of his remaining pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and since there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, after Billy took his share, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

"Hello there, I'm Isabelle. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two aquariums with snails and fish. One aquarium has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference in snails is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

We know that the difference in snails is twice the total number of fish, so we can write the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, we can divide both sides by 2 again to find the value of x:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we determine the cost for each day of makeup application. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works for 6 hours each day. So, the cost per day is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since the makeup artist needs to be done 4 times a week, we multiply the daily cost by 4 to get the weekly cost: $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so we multiply the weekly cost by 5 to get the total cost: $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is completed, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount on the total cost. To calculate the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1: 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the amount Jean paid: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister.
- Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.
- Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
- Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies
- Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories

We're also given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

Now, we know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33. 

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 33 = -3.

However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of students. This means that the given information is inconsistent.

But, if we assume that the given information is correct, then the number of boys in the third class is -3."

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46.
The total number of cougars killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

"Let's figure out where Bill is now. To do that, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 6 = 18

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 
21 * 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Sylas initially had 10 stalls with 20 cows each. He bought 40 more cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls.

First, we need to find out how many cows he added to each stall. To do this, we divide the total number of cows bought by the number of stalls.

Number of cows added to each stall = 40 / 10
= 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 * 8
= 192

The final answer is: 192"
"Let's count the money in Brady's piggy bank. 

First, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill. 
- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together:
$1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section.

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight.

30% of 8000 is 0.3 * 8000 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples.
3. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
5. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
6. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then divide that by the number of cookies per cup of flour.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5. 

Since 5.5 dozens is the same as 5 dozen and 6 cookies, we need to calculate the flour needed for 6 cookies. 6 cookies is half of a dozen, so we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we need to add the flour needed for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. 5 dozen cookies need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

So, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first find two thirds of 9,300. 

Two thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"Let's calculate the total number of marbles Maddison has now.

Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, so she initially has 5 x 50 = 250 marbles.

She then receives 20 marbles from her friend.

To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we add the marbles she already has to the marbles she received from her friend.

Total marbles = 250 + 20 = 270

The final answer is: 270"
"Let's break down the information given. Chris has 6 trees in his yard. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. To find the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard, we divide Chris's trees by 2: 6 / 2 = 3.

Now, we need to find the number of trees in Harry's yard. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

So, Harry has 11 trees.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"

To find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to add up their individual amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. 

The selling price is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

The difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to find the total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

We then subtract the total fees from the selling price to find the net selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: 71"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the total spent on newspaper ads and television ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

"Hello there. Let's figure out how many blue golf balls the juggler has. 

First, we need to find out how many golf balls the juggler can juggle. Since half of the balls are golf balls, we divide the total number of balls by 2.

Total balls = 16
Golf balls = Total balls / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8

Now, we know that half of the golf balls are blue. So, we divide the number of golf balls by 2 to find the number of blue golf balls.

Blue golf balls = Golf balls / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4

"Hello there. Let's calculate the total number of windows in John's houses. 

First, we need to find the total number of bedrooms. John has 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, so the total number of bedrooms is 2 * 3 = 6.

Each bedroom has 2 windows, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

There are 4 additional windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of windows is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows, which is 12 + 8 = 20.

"Let's break down the information given. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete. The collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Carly had 80 cards in total.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Mico and Marco's current ages add up to 20. To find their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages.

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as m. We know that M + m = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: (M + m) + 20. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute this into the expression to get 20 + 20 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given two pieces of information about Ruby and Sam's ages.

First, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. This can be expressed as R = 6S, where R is Ruby's age and S is Sam's age.

The second piece of information tells us that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as (R + 9) = 3(S + 9).

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S. We get 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get S = 6.

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's calculate the total amount Peter paid for the popsicles and ice cream bars.

First, we need to find the cost of the popsicles. Since he purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, we multiply the number of popsicles by the cost per popsicle: 20 * $0.25 = $5.

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so we multiply the number of ice cream bars by the cost per ice cream bar: 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of spots on the cobras. Since there are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Next, we need to find the total number of spots on the mambas. Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

To find the total number of spots on both the cobras and the mambas, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you figure out how much Maddy will spend on pizzas for her cousin's soccer game.

First, let's calculate the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's 15 people in total. Each team member brings 2 guests, which means there are 12 * 2 = 24 guests. Adding the team members and coaches to the guests, we get a total of 15 + 24 = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy. 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 * 15 = $195.

So, Maddy will spend $195 on pizzas for her cousin's soccer game.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we need to find the total length of the space between the gemstones. 

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

Now, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: 25 - 8 = 17 inches. However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: 1.75 / (1/4) = 1.75 / 0.25 = 7.

So, Katerina uses 7 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"Let's calculate the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled her stories, so she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.

Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. In the second week, he doubled his stories, so he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.

Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled her stories, so she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we add the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

To find the total number of stories written in the second week, we add the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot: 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

Now, we add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week to find the total number of stories written altogether: 120 + 240 = 360.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the flag has three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars in the 8-star rows and 6-star rows.

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two cars, one in the fast lane and one in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, while the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles, we can calculate its time as follows:
time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Now, we need to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at 30 miles per hour, we can use the same formula:
time = distance / speed = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

The final answer is: 16"
"I'm Izzy, and I'm a superstar counter just like my friend Ali. I've won 17 medals for counting super fast. I know Ali has 22 medals, which is 5 more than mine. Together, we have a total of 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

I've heard that together, we have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. To find out how many medals have been given out, I need to figure out what number multiplied by 10 equals 39.

Let's call the total number of medals given out ""x"". Then, 10x = 39. To find x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 10.

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. There are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get: 16 / 8 = 2.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Susan's earnings for the online task. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break in between, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

To find out how much she earns, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the points of the three friends after the fourth round.

Mike initially has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 21 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Will buys 15 oranges and asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old.

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 
He washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 
15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down Darren's workout routine over two days. On the first day, he does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

On the second day, he increases his pushups by 20, decreases his squats by 10, and doubles his dumbbell presses.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Total for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

The total count of activities in two days is 170 + 200 = 370."
"Hello there. Let's calculate how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household with 5 members who eat rice every lunch and dinner. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down Sam's bread sales for the week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so we'll start by calculating the total number of crates he sold on the other days.

Over the weekend, Sam sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates. To find the total number of crates sold, we add these amounts together.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

Now, let's compare this to Sam's target of 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total number of crates sold from the target.

Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Carmen starts with a bid of $200 and each subsequent bid increases by $50. There are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them. This means there are 3 bids from the other people, and then 3 bids from Carmen, making a total of 6 bids.

To find the total cost of the desk, we need to calculate the sum of these 6 bids. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 200 (the initial bid), d = 50 (the increase in each bid), and n = 6 (the total number of bids). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

The final answer is: $1950"
"To calculate the total cost John pays for driving, we need to consider the total miles driven, the driving cost, and the bonus he gives his driver.

First, let's find the total miles driven. Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 

Next, we calculate the total miles driven per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. Then, we find the total miles driven per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Now, let's calculate the total driving cost. John is charged $2 per mile driven. So, the total driving cost per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

In addition to the driving cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus per year, we multiply this by 12: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Finally, we add the total driving cost and the total bonus to find the total cost per year: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, let's consider how the pages are arranged after folding.

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper.

For a 32-page tabloid, we can consider the following arrangement:

- The first page (page 1) is on the left back.
- The second page (page 2) is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back.
- The 31st page is on the right front.

This pattern continues until we reach the middle of the paper, where the 16th page is on the left back and the 15th page is on the left front.

After the middle, the pattern reverses, with the 17th page on the right back and the 16th page on right front.

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, we need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages (left and right sides) and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages (left and right sides).

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 (for the first 16 pages) + 2 (for the last 16 pages) = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down Annika's expenses at the town fair. She started with $50. 

First, she spent half of it on food and snacks. To find half of $50, we divide 50 by 2, which equals $25. 

Annika also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (on food and snacks) + $10 (on rides) = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at $20, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45.

To find the total amount of money she earned in the second year, we need to first determine the number of books sold in the second year. We know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We also know that the number of books sold this year is 45, and the number of books sold in the first year is twice the number of books sold this year, which is 2 * 45 = 90.

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first year and this year from the total number of books sold: 200 - 45 - 90 = 65.

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = $1300.

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"Let's break down the information given. John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he lost to, we need to calculate the percentage of people he didn't beat, which is 20%.

20% of 20 people is the number of people John lost to. To find this, we multiply 0.2 by 20.

0.2 * 20 = 4

So, John lost to 4 people."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we need to calculate two-thirds of 60.

Two-thirds of 60 is 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. We subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves produced.

60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we need to calculate half of the remaining loaves.

Half of 20 is 20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight in the same amount of time as Joey, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds by 4. 

4 weeks * 4 = 16 weeks."
"To find the total savings, let's calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a serum that makes the drinker grow extra limbs at specific intervals. 

First, we need to figure out how many extra arms the person will grow. Since they grow an extra arm every 3 days, we can divide the total number of days (15) by 3 to find out how many extra arms that is. 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Next, we need to calculate how many extra legs the person will grow. They grow an extra leg every 5 days, so we divide the total number of days (15) by 5 to find out how many extra legs that is. 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

Now, we just need to add the number of extra arms and legs together to find the total number of new limbs. 5 extra arms + 3 extra legs = 8 new limbs.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down Theo's expenses for his business trip to South Africa.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600. Then, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150. 

Next, we determine the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the total cost so far: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

To find out how much Theo has left, we subtract the total cost from his initial budget: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost so far) = $4050.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract this amount from his remaining budget: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

This means Theo has $2050 left over, which he can spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a family of 5, and three of them eat 3 eggs each day, while the rest eat 2 eggs each day.

First, let's find out how many eggs the three people who eat 3 eggs each day consume in a day. That's 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs the rest of the family members consume in a day. There are 5 - 3 = 2 family members left, and they eat 2 eggs each day, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a day, we add the eggs eaten by both groups: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to multiply the daily consumption by 7 to find the total number of eggs consumed in a week: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. To find Jane's age, we subtract 3 from Quinn's age: 30 - 3 = 27.

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we add 5 to Jane's age: 27 + 5 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Noah's current age. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old. Since then, Noah has aged 6 years, so his current age is 20 + 6 = 26 years.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old at that time, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. This means the current population is twice the population six years ago, which is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that the football team has a total of 105 members. The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, and the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. Then, the number of players on the offense is 2D, and the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

The final answer is: 30"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help Martha plan her Christmas party. Let's start by calculating the total number of people invited. 

Martha invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people. To find the total number of people, we multiply the number of families by the number of people in each family.

2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. We subtract these people from the total number of people invited.
24 - 8 = 16 people

Now, 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments. To find this number, we divide 8 by 4.
8 / 4 = 2 people

These 2 people also couldn't attend the party. We subtract them from the remaining number of people invited.
16 - 2 = 14 people

So, 14 people will show up for Martha's party.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. To find the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna, we add 20 and 50, which equals 70.

Next, his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find 2/5 of 20, we multiply 2/5 by 20, which equals 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. We add the marbles he bought from Johanna (20) to the marbles his father gave him (8) and the marbles already in the store (50), which equals 20 + 8 + 50 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"Hello there. To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the information given. We know the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. We're also told that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

To find the number of girls, we multiply the number of boys by 3:
Girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we calculate the number of nongendered children by multiplying the number of boys by 1/10:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children in the classroom:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find out how many people left, we need to calculate 1/4 of 40, which is 40 * 1/4 = 10.

Since 10 people left, the number of people remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were 25 men initially, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 (because 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men).

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

"To find out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider the weakening caused by both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening caused by the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and we want to cool it down by 65 degrees. 

The temperature difference is 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. So, the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since 5 ice cubes are added, the coffee becomes 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that 5 people came in with old records and left with 7 new records. Since they trade 2 old records for 1 new record, we need to find out how many old records they brought in.

Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the number of old records traded is twice the number of new records. 

Number of new records = 7
Number of old records traded = 2 * Number of new records
Number of old records traded = 2 * 7
Number of old records traded = 14

Since there are 5 people, and they all brought in the same number of old records, we can divide the total number of old records traded by 5 to find out how many old records each person brought in.

Number of old records per person = Number of old records traded / Number of people
Number of old records per person = 14 / 5
Number of old records per person = 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records.

Total number of old records = Number of old records per person * Number of people
Total number of old records = 2.8 * 5
Total number of old records = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers:
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
= 2/5 * 100
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is:
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers:
Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Now, let's find the salary of senior programmers:
Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:
Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's find the total amount paid to all programmers:
Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

"Let's break down Oscar's lollipop adventure step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. On his way to school, he eats 2, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes 14 out to his friends, which brings his total down to 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

After school, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, Oscar eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, bringing his total down to 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to charge 40%, we multiply 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

"Let's break down the customer's shopping trip. They spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which earned them $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they earned 4 rewards, which is $4 off their current shopping trip.

On their current shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, which is $4 off the price. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much the customer paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent: $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's break down the information given for the two job options.

For Job A, we know the hourly wage is $15 and the total hours worked per year is 2000. To find the total income, we multiply the hourly wage by the total hours worked: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year.

Next, we need to calculate the income tax for Job A. The state has a 20% total tax rate, so we multiply the total income by the tax rate: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. 

Now, we subtract the income tax from the total income to find the net income for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, we know the total income is $42,000. However, there's a property tax of $6,000 and a 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax. First, we subtract the property tax from the total income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. This is the net income before tax.

Next, we calculate the income tax for Job B by multiplying the net income before tax by the tax rate: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.

Finally, we subtract the income tax from the net income before tax to find the net income for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we first need to determine the total number of ruined castles. Since 40% of the 220 castles are ruins, we can calculate this by multiplying 220 by 0.4.

0.4 * 220 = 88

Now, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find this number, we'll divide the total number of ruined castles by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"Let's break down the two offers from Furniture United and Cozy Homes to determine the cost difference.

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment. The total amount paid in installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment. The total amount paid in installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers. Subtracting the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from Furniture United's offer, we get $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"Let's calculate the total number of paintball guns they have. DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 

Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

Now, let's divide the total number of guns by the number of people. There are 4 people.

24 / 4 = 6

If they were to share their guns equally, each person would have 6 guns."
"To find the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

For 8 batches of suckers, Mason needs 8 x 30 ounces = 240 ounces of sugar.

For 1 batch of fudge, Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar.

The total amount of sugar Mason needs is 240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge) = 310 ounces.

The final answer is: 310"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each. 

First, we need to find the price of the shares after the first year, when the stock price increases by 50%. To do this, we calculate 50% of the initial price and add it to the initial price. 50% of $8 is 0.5 * $8 = $4. So, the price of each share after the first year is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, we need to find the price of the shares after the second year, when the stock price decreases by 25%. To do this, we calculate 25% of the price after the first year and subtract it from the price after the first year. 25% of $12 is 0.25 * $12 = $3. So, the price of each share after the second year is $12 - $3 = $9.

Now, we can find the total value of all Maria's shares by multiplying the number of shares by the price of each share after the second year. The total number of shares is 8, and the price of each share after the second year is $9. Therefore, the total value of all Maria's shares is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"Let's break down the information given. We know Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. Since John ate half the amount Thomas ate, we can calculate this by dividing the number of hot dogs Thomas ate by 2: 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a class of 200 students that's split into 3 groups. Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two.

Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the last group has 10 fewer students, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. So, we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x: 
70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, and they are all either chickens or cows. We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H.

Since H = 2C, we can substitute H in the equation H + C = 60 with 2C, resulting in 2C + C = 60. This simplifies to 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Since H = 2C, we can find the value of H by multiplying C by 2, resulting in H = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"Josh decides to take up juggling to perform at the school talent show a month in the future. He starts off practicing juggling 3 balls, and slowly gets better adding 1 ball to his juggling act each week. After the end of the fourth week, the talent show begins, but when Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops three of his balls. 2 of them are caught by people in the crowd as they roll off the stage, but one gets lost completely since the auditorium is dark.

To find out how many balls Josh has left, we need to calculate how many balls he had initially and then subtract the ones he lost. Josh had 3 balls initially and added 1 ball each week for 4 weeks, so he had 3 + 4 = 7 balls. When he dropped 3 balls, 2 were caught, so 1 ball was lost.

So, Josh starts juggling with 7 balls and loses 1, leaving him with 7 - 1 = 6 balls.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that a pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, a green toad, and that the yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog. We also know that the red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can determine the weights of the other animals as follows:

- The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of the animals and the container:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the information given. Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits. Then, she received twice that amount at her baby shower, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits. Her mom also gifted her 15 baby outfits.

To find the total number of outfits, we need to add these amounts together: 24 + 48 + 15.

24 + 48 = 72
72 + 15 = 87

So, Laurel now has a total of 87 baby outfits for her little one."
"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run. 

The original distance Tyson runs is 5000 meters. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. 

1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters. 

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"Let's break down the prices of the juice boxes. Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we need to subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C. That's 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Hello there. Let's calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have. 

First, we need to find the number of legs for each type of table. The restaurant has 40 tables with 4 legs. To find the total number of legs for these tables, we multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.

Next, we have 50 tables with 3 legs. To find the total number of legs for these tables, we multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.

Now, let's add the number of legs from both types of tables: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jenny buys a bag of cookies that contains 36 cookies. Her son puts 4 cookies in his lunch box 5 days a week, which means he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies a week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies a week.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies eaten by her son and husband: 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in the bag, and 27 are used by her son and husband, we need to find out how many cookies are left for Jenny. To do this, we subtract the number of cookies eaten by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in the bag: 36 - 27 = 9.

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The discount is 40% of $30.

40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt.

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to get the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase in the amount the factory makes per day, we need to compare the current daily earnings to the previous daily earnings.

The factory used to sell 10 tractors a day at $100 each, so their previous daily earnings were 10 * $100 = $1000.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day at $220 each, so their current daily earnings are 5 * $220 = $1100.

To find the difference in earnings, we subtract the previous earnings from the current earnings: $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the previous earnings and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they made tractors.

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total cost per month and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the cost of food per month: 
Food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so the food cost per month is $25 * 4 = $100.

Now, let's add the cost of treats and medicine to the food cost:
Treats cost $20 per month, and medicine costs $100 per month. 
Total cost per month = $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine)
Total cost per month = $220

Now, let's multiply the total cost per month by 12 to get the total cost per year:
Total cost per year = Total cost per month * 12
Total cost per year = $220 * 12
Total cost per year = $2640

On Wednesday, she attends a half-hour cheese-tasting event. On Thursday, she goes on a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class, which is 1.5 hours. Finally, on Friday, she has two hours of errands.

To find the total time, we need to add up the time for all activities. 

1 hour (yoga) + 3 hours (cooking) + 0.5 hours (cheese-tasting) + 1.5 hours (museum tour) + 2 hours (errands) = 7.5 hours

To do this, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs. April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. She also needs twice as many for the roses, which is 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots.

So, the total number of plant pots she needs is 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

"Let's break down John's activities during his vacation. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. He also watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We know that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. If 30% of the total time is 6 hours, we can find the total time by dividing 6 by 0.30. This gives us 6 / 0.30 = 20 hours.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying 0.40 by the total time: 0.40 * 20 = 8 hours.

"I'm trying to save up for a new phone that costs $400. I already have $80 in my savings. I just got two jobs to help me reach my goal.

At my first job, I earn $10 per hour and I worked for 20 hours. That's a total of $10/hour * 20 hours = $200.

At my second job, I earn $5 per hour and I worked for 15 hours. That's a total of $5/hour * 15 hours = $75.

So, in total, I earned $200 + $75 = $275 from both jobs.

To find out how much more I need to save, I'll subtract my total earnings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $275 = $125.

I still need to save $125 to buy the phone.

"I'd be happy to help Morgan figure out how many friends she can invite to her birthday party.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities. A round of mini-golf costs $5, and Morgan wants to play one round. The cost of arcade tokens is $5, and she wants $5 for each friend. The cost of go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so that's $20.

The total cost for Morgan and her friends is $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30.

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. $90 - $30 = $60.

However, we need to subtract Morgan's cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. Morgan's cost is $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $10. $60 - $10 = $50.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. $50 / $30 = 1.67

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 1.67 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35.

"Hi there, let's solve this problem together. Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day from her parents. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each every day and saves the change in her piggy bank. 

First, we need to convert the cost of lollipops from cents to dollars. 
25 cents = $0.25
So, 4 lollipops cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day.
Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days.
Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Billy starts with $10 that his father gave him. He buys some candy at $1.5 per pound, and then he spends half of his change on gumballs that cost $0.05 each. We know he bought 40 gumballs.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of the change he had after buying the candy. Let's call the amount of candy he bought 'x' pounds. The cost of the candy is $1.5x, so the amount of money he had left after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

The amount he spent on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2. We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's solve the problem. We know that Carver's age is 45, and it's 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this as an equation:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the distance from the third city to the first city. To do this, we add the distances from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city, then subtract 50 miles.

Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Combined distance: 75 + 100 = 175 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance traveled in one trip. 
Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 125 miles
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is:
Total distance in one trip: 300 miles
Total trips in a day: 3
Total distance in a day: 300 * 3 = 900 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we need to divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day.
Total distance between services: 18,000 miles
Total distance in a day: 900 miles
Number of days between services: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2. 
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 
Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip separately.

First, let's find the time taken to drive to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. 
Time taken to drive to friend's house = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.857 hours (approximately).

However, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance to his friend's house is 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles. 
Time taken to drive to friend's house with detour = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Next, let's find the time taken to drive back home. The distance back home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. 
Time taken to drive back home = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Now, we can find the total time taken for the trip by adding the time taken to drive to his friend's house and the time taken to drive back home.
Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to friend's house + Time taken to drive back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"Let's break down the information given:

3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. 

A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
S = 4 * 3 - 5
S = 12 - 5
S = 7

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
V = 3 * S
V = 3 * 7
V = 21

If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we need to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. 
Let's denote the number of people kicked out for other reasons as O. 
The total number of people kicked out is the sum of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons.

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's start with the picture frames. Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20. Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to consider the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost, which is 20% of $20, or $4 per frame. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching together: $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will also receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Lastly, 1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will receive cords that cost $12 each. Since 1/4 of 44 is 11, 11 seniors will receive cords. The total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

To find the total cost of all the gifts, we add the cost of the picture frames and etching, the cost of the pins, and the cost of the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"Let's break down the shoe sale. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double that number of shoes, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:

Milk from half of the sheep: 15 * 1 kg = 15 kg

Now, let's find out how much milk she collects from the other half of the sheep. Since the other half is also 15 sheep, we multiply 15 by 2 kg.

Milk from the other half of the sheep: 15 * 2 kg = 30 kg

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much profit Millie will make per hour running her lemonade stand.

First, we need to find out how many cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. So, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take her to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups to sell, she will spend 36 / 4 = 9 hours selling all the lemonade.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the number of girls. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. To find the total number of people performing, we add the number of girls who can make it to the show (26 - 13 = 13) to the number of teachers (3). So, the total number of people performing is 13 + 3 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Then, we divide the sum by the number of scores to find the average:
400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's calculate the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils.

First, we need to find the cost of 6 erasers. Since each eraser costs $2, we multiply 6 by $2 to get the total cost of the erasers. 

6 * $2 = $12

Next, we need to find the cost of 8 pencils. Since each pencil costs $3, we multiply 8 by $3 to get the total cost of the pencils.

8 * $3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together to get the total cost.

$12 + $24 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out the cost of the rides for Dasha. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides, the total cost for her is 9 * $4 = $36.

Now, let's look at David's option. He buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. This means he doesn't need to buy any additional tickets.

Since they both ride all 9 rides, the cost for Dasha is $36 and the cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha: $36 - $30 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. To find the total number of popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the ratio parts (5+6=11) and then multiply by the respective ratio parts.

Let's calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty's popsicles = (5/11) * 165 = 75
Sam's popsicles = (6/11) * 165 = 90

Now, let's find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty:
Difference = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15

"Let's break down the cost of the streaming services. Tim gets Netflix for $10 a month. 

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% for bundling. To find the bundled cost, we need to calculate 20% of $20 (the normal cost of both services). 

20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"
"Let's break down the time Carol spent working on her song. She spent 4 hours writing it, which is half the time she spent recording it. So, she must have spent 4 / 2 = 2 hours recording it. 

As for editing, she spent 90 minutes, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the total time she spent working on her song: 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we need to divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100. 

(1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Erica initially made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she got 2 * 15 = 30 cards from her dad.

Now, Erica has 20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her dad) = 50 cards.

Next, Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

After giving away 29 cards, Erica had 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

Finally, Erica received 17 cards from family and friends, so she now has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the number of millipedes. Since there are 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, we can calculate this by dividing the number of spiders by 3. 

Number of spiders: 90
Number of millipedes: 90 / 3 = 30

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The problem states that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. 

Number of stink bugs: 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together.

Total number of bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

"To determine how many bags of flour Mark needs to buy, we need to divide the total amount of flour required by the amount of flour in each bag. 

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour for a single batch, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, so the total flour required is 4 * 3 cups = 12 cups. Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so we divide the total flour required by the amount in each bag: 12 / 2 = 6.

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to divide the total amount of milk required by the amount of milk in each bottle. The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk for a single batch, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, so the total milk required is 4 * 1 cup = 4 cups. Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so we divide the total milk required by the amount in each bottle: 4 / 2 = 2.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk. 

Difference = Number of bags of flour - Number of bottles of milk

"To find the energy saved, we first need to find the energy used per day and then subtract the new energy used from the original energy used.

The original energy used per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new energy used per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh.

The energy saved per day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

"To make enough muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people, we need to determine how many sandwiches are required. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So, we need 5 pounds of each.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese.

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis, and he initially has 40 cannolis. This means he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan then buys 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 fewer corns, which is 60 - 20 = 40 corns.

Now, let's add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought: 
Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 40
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 40 = 120
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 120 + 100 = 220."
"Let's break down Elliott's steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and it averages 200 words per page, we can calculate the total number of words in the book.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Now, we can find the time it takes to read the book by dividing the total number of words by Toby's reading rate of 300 words per minute.

Time to read the book = Total words / reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so we need to add this to the time it takes to read the book to find out the total time Toby will be at the airport.

Total time at the airport = Time to read the book + Time to get to the airport = 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we can find out how many minutes early he will be by subtracting the time he arrives from the time he has to be there.

Time early = Time to be at the airport - Total time at the airport = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"Let's break down Sally's purchases at the seashore. She bought 2 pounds of taffy, which is a special deal where one pound costs $3 and the other pound is half off. So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

In addition to the taffy, Sally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of her purchases from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total amount Tim spent on fireworks.

To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework, then apply the discount.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

He gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, so the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is $960 (fireworks) + $150 (finale firework) = $1110.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the conditions given. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

However, the problem also states that these candles are part of the 1% of candles that are more dangerous and can explode. This means that the 2500 candles that smell like wet dog are a subset of the 1% of candles that can explode. To find the total number of candles that can explode, we need to find 1% of 50000, which is 0.01 * 50000 = 500.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, we can find this by multiplying 5% by the number of candles that can explode: 0.05 * 500 = 25.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's call the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a herd consisting of camels and dromedaries. We know that there are 180 heads and 304 bumps in total.

First, let's consider the number of heads. Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is equal to the sum of the number of camels and the number of dromedaries. We can write this as an equation:

C + D = 180

Now, let's consider the number of bumps. Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each. So, the total number of bumps is equal to twice the number of camels plus the number of dromedaries. We can write this as another equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve this system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

"Let's break down Tom's two-week-long trip through Europe. 

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

In the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is (30/100) * 800 km = 240 km. So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

In the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip: 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Stanley was initially standing at an elevation of 10,000 feet. When the comb fell, it dropped 4,000 feet to a ledge below. To find the elevation where the comb landed, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation.

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

Next, we're told that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Now, let's substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction gives us: T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we get: 3T - 6 = 18.

Adding 6 to both sides, we get: 3T = 24.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find: T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"Hello there. Let's calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip.

We have 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each, so the total capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

Next, we have 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each, so the total capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

Lastly, we have 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each, so the total capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Lillian built 3 bird feeders and bought 3 others. We know that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Since the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, the homemade feeders must attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders: 3 * 30 = 90. And the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders: 3 * 20 = 60.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted to the homemade and store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"Let's break down the costs of Aleksandra's dinner. The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5. The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

The final answer is: $11"
"Hello there, trainer! I'm Isabelle, the friendly Pokémon Center nurse. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many Pokémon cards Kenny started with.

Kenny wants to buy a ticket to the amusement park, which costs $100. He has some Pokémon cards to sell for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash. To find out how many cards he started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold.

Since Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he needs to make $50 from selling the cards. We can calculate the number of cards he sold by dividing the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5 = 33.33 (round down to 33 since you can't sell a fraction of a card)

However, Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.33

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to determine how many hotdogs were prepared. The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests were prepared for to have two hotdogs. This means 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests. 

However, the caterer prepared enough for the other half of the guests (also 18) to have one hotdog each. So, 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests. 

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were needed. 

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. This means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. Indras has 6 letters in her name, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 6 + 7 = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Charlotte's shopping problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. Charlotte wants a set of pot and pans for $120.00, a set of mixing bowls for $20.00, and 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each. 

To find the total cost of the utensils, we multiply the cost of one utensil by the number of utensils: 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $120.00 (pot and pans) + $20.00 (mixing bowls) + $25.00 (utensils) = $165.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The clerk told Charlotte that everything is 20% off. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20 (which is the decimal form of 20%): $165.00 x 0.20 = $33.00.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte needs to pay: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"Hi there, I'm Isabelle. Let's help Dora figure out how much more money she needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

First, we need to find the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, which means she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the information given. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons with his mighty sword. Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. To find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew, we need to calculate three quarters of 100, which is 75.

Now, Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Since Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons, Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Lastly, Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file. To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to calculate one-fifth of 150, which is 150 / 5 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. 

1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons

Now we convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 0.75 by 8.

0.75 * 8 = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money George spent on chips. Since he bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, the total cost of the chips is 3 * 40 cents = $1.20.

Now, we know that George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his money, which is equal to $4.99.

The amount of money George spent on chips is $1.20, so the amount of money he spent on candy bars is $4.99 - $1.20 = $3.79.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find the number of candy bars George bought by dividing the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: $3.79 / 0.75 = 5.0533.

Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's solve the problem together. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and decided to keep 5 for himself. To find out how many lollipops he shared with his friends, we need to subtract the lollipops he kept from the total.

25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept) = 20 lollipops shared

Now, we need to divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends. Ray has 4 friends, so we'll divide 20 by 4.

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rory makes a cake that weighs 20 ounces and she cuts it into 8 equal pieces. Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find out how much cake is left.

First, we need to find the weight of each piece. To do this, we divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Now, we know that Rory and her mom each have a piece, so we need to find the total weight of the cake they ate. Since they each had one piece, the total weight eaten is equal to 2 times the weight of each piece.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's figure out how many oranges everyone will get. Sitti and Juris have a total of 34 and 22 oranges, respectively. To find the total number of oranges, we add them together: 34 + 22 = 56.

Now, they want to share these oranges with their 6 other friends, making a total of 8 people. To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

"Bonjour! Let's calculate the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup. 

First, we need to determine the total cost of the ingredients. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to get the total cost of the ingredients: $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we can find the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's. So, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time difference between their arrival times.

If Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, and she needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.

However, since we want to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to subtract the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater from the time Bernadette needs to leave. So, Bernadette should leave 21 - 4 = 17 minutes before Wayne.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"Let's break down the information given. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has 1 x 20 = 20 red beads and 2 x 20 = 40 clear beads. In total, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has 3 x 20 = 60 blue beads and 4 x 20 = 80 red beads. In total, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract the total number of beads Elizabeth has from the total number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Hello there. Let's break down the situation with Marcus and his house. 

Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and his oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's consider the effect of the open window. Marcus leaves the window open for 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. For every 10 minutes the window is open, the house cools down by 2 degrees. Therefore, for 30 minutes, it cools down by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

To find the final temperature, we add the initial temperature to the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the open window. So, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Jon's times for the swim, bike, and run are 40 minutes, 80 minutes, and 50 minutes, respectively. 

To find James' total time, we need to consider the changes in his times compared to Jon's. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so his swim time is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes. He takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find James' total time. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes. 

To find James' run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"I'd be happy to help Rozanne figure out how many trays of eggnog she can make. 

First, let's count the total number of eggs she has. Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases, which is 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Then, she adds 2 loose eggs from the cupboard, making a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Now, let's determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass needs 5 eggs, so Rozanne can make 50 / 5 = 10 glasses of eggnog.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we can find out how many trays Rozanne can put out by dividing the total number of glasses by 5. That's 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday: 17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is 17 x $20 = $340.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store: There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is 31 x $25 = $775.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale: $340 + $775 = $1115.

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue: $1115 - $576 = $539.

"Let's break down the information given:

You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?

Let's analyze the situation: If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If you buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a set of magician's cards with different colors. There are 15 red cards. The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.

60% of 15 is 0.6 * 15 = 9. So, the number of green cards is 15 + 9 = 24.

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards. Therefore, the number of yellow cards is 15 + 24 = 39.

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78.

"Let's break down the situation. Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest. After about twenty minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined the group.

So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 

To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total number of fairies.

First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer has 8 puppies, and Brandon has 12 puppies. 

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon has 4 puppies with spots.

Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed he's buying. 

First, let's calculate the weight of each type of feed. 

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"Let's break down Grayson's recycling earnings. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. 

Aluminum cans are worth two cents each, so three cans are worth 3 * 2 = 6 cents. 
Plastic bottles are worth three cents each, so five bottles are worth 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

To find her weekly earnings, we add the value of the cans and bottles: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

Since there are four weeks in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate 1/5 of the cost of the pizza and add it to the cost of the pizza.

The cost of the pizza is $15. To find 1/5 of this amount, we multiply $15 by 1/5.

1/5 of $15 = (1/5) * $15
1/5 of $15 = $3

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man.

Total amount = Cost of the pizza + Tip
Total amount = $15 + $3
Total amount = $18

The final answer is: $18"

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Miss Maria's sports card collection. 

To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Each student gets 10 cards, so the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much Becky paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents. Since there's a $1 discount, we subtract 100 cents from the total cost: 900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 800 cents / 100 = $8.

Next, we need to find out how much Kelly paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents. Since there's a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of 1000 cents. To do this, we multiply 1000 cents by 0.1: 0.1 * 1000 cents = 100 cents. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: 1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 900 cents / 100 = $9.

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. We do this by subtracting Becky's total cost from Kelly's total cost: $9 - $8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Hello there. I'm Isabelle, and I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply it by the total number of rooms.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets: 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases: 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Total number of items per room: 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15

Now, multiply the total number of items per room by the total number of rooms: 15 * 80 = 1200

The final answer is: 1200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Fireman Frank initially has 200 shoes. 

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is equivalent to 5 * 2 = 10 shoes. So, he now has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes. Now, he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes. So, he now has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. To find the number of shoes he has left, we subtract 180 from 300, which gives us 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final answer is: 120"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Mary's cupcake dilemma. 

To figure out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to first determine how many cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, she can decorate 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Next, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide 48 by 12 to get the number of pans.

48 / 12 = 4

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the cost of the paper, we need to calculate three times the price of the pen and then subtract $1 from it. 

Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6. 
The cost of the paper is $6 - $1 = $5.

The total cost of the pen and the paper is $2 + $5 = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10, so the change she received is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

There are 30 students in Marissa's class, and each student started the year with 10 pencils. To find the total number of pencils initially in the class, we multiply the number of students by the number of pencils each student had.

Total pencils initially = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find the number of pencils used, we multiply the total pencils by 1/5.

Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils

Now, we subtract the pencils used from the total pencils to find the remaining pencils after two months.

Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find the number of pencils left, we multiply the remaining pencils by 1/3.

Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's solve the problem together. Matt's dad has a deal with him: for every carrot stick Matt eats, he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, how many carrot sticks does he have to eat?

Let's call the number of carrot sticks Matt eats 'x'. According to the deal, the number of cookies he gets is (1/2)x + 2. Since Matt wants to eat five cookies, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a 10-foot shark with 2 remoras attached to it, and each remora is 6 inches long. To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their length from inches to feet.

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing it by 12. 

6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

Now, we have 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we'll divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

So, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, which means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We're given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, and this number represents one-fourth of the total number of students.

We can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to isolate x:
x = 20 * 4
x = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many days Jason has to walk in total, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). 

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we need to divide the total number of days by 4 to find out how many days he has to walk each week.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought in total. 

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

"To calculate the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we need to consider the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price of $1500 per day. To find the new price, we multiply the normal price by 1.2, which gives us 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, let's add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip: $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

Now, we need to find the combined weight of the two pennies. We add the weight of the 1959 penny to the weight of the 2010 penny.

36 + 48 = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's calculate how much more Keegan and Tasha need to earn for their baseball camp.

Keegan has earned $83 by 3 pm, and Tasha has earned $91. To find the total amount they have earned so far, we add these two amounts together.

Total amount earned = $83 + $91 = $174

Now, we need to subtract this total from their goal of $200 to find out how much more they need to earn.

Amount needed to reach the goal = $200 - $174 = $26

The final answer is: $26"
"Let's break down the problem. Gabriel has 20 songs on his portable media player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Since the player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs to his player. Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we need to subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add. So, 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked from the farm. If they picked a total of 60 oranges, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate.

To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 2 by 60 and then divide the result by 5. 
2 * 60 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.
24 * $10 = $240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first calculate the total miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. 
So, miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles run in a week by his speed.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Uncle Ben has four horses, and each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal. Since he feeds his horses twice a day, each horse eats 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

To find the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day, we multiply the amount each horse eats by the number of horses: 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed for five days. We multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed by the weight of one bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs: 200 / 50 = 4.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello there. Let's solve the problem together. Jana has 27 puppies, and two thirds of them are Pomeranians. To find the number of Pomeranians, we can multiply 27 by 2/3.

First, we multiply 27 by 2 to get 54, and then we divide by 3 to get 18. So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can multiply 18 by 1/3.

First, we multiply 18 by 1 to get 18, and then we divide by 3 to get 6. So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add the temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48°F, in Northlandia is 21°F, and in Midlandia is -3°F.

First, add the temperatures: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Then, divide the sum by 3: -30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F."
"Let's calculate how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount for the toy car.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 in savings. To find the remaining amount, we subtract the amount already saved from the total cost.

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount.

Daily savings = $2
Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount for the toy car."
"Let's figure out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray. Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and he has 2 trays. To find out how many eggs can fit on the trays, we multiply the number of eggs each tray can hold by the number of trays:

24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Now, we need to subtract the number of eggs that can fit on the trays from the total number of eggs Jaime has:

64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Heather buys razors that come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. They are currently on sale for buy one get one free, which means she only pays for half the number of packs she buys. She also has a $2.00 coupon.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale. Since she only pays for half the number of packs, she pays for 1 pack, which is $4.00. 

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost. The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, she walks 5 * 8 = 40 minutes every day.

She worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how old Brett will be in four years. Since he is currently 14 years old, we add 4 to his current age: 14 + 4 = 18.

Now, we know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, we multiply Brett's current age by 3: 14 * 3 = 42.

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out her current age, we subtract 4 from 42: 42 - 4 = 38.

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old."
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is 14 days * $6 per day = $84.

The cost of the afternoon rides is 14 days * $2 per day = $28.

The total cost is $84 + $28 = $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"Let's calculate how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has a total of 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can find out how many pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by 3.

120 / 3 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two venues to choose from for Mark's surprise party. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of the number of guests. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends, but it includes food in the price.

To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost for each guest). The cost of the second venue is $25x (per person charge).

Now, let's set up the equation to find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. 

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

The sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. We can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many yards Mariah used. She used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we can multiply 364 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 364 by 4.

364 ÷ 4 = 91 yards

Now, let's find out how many yards her grandma used. She used 1/2 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/2 of 364, we can multiply 364 by 1/2, which is the same as dividing 364 by 2.

364 ÷ 2 = 182 yards

Now that we know how many yards Mariah and her grandma used, we can add them together to find the total yards of yarn used.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Cherrie wants to buy Christmas gifts for her 5 friends. Two of her friends want 5 gifts each, and the other 3 friends want 2 gifts each.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts for the friends who want 5 gifts each: 2 friends * 5 gifts = 10 gifts.
Next, let's calculate the total number of gifts for the friends who want 2 gifts each: 3 friends * 2 gifts = 6 gifts.
Now, we add the number of gifts for both groups: 10 gifts + 6 gifts = 16 gifts.
Finally, Cherrie decides to surprise her friends by getting 10 more random gifts. To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we add these 10 random gifts to the previous total: 16 gifts + 10 gifts = 26 gifts.

"Let's break down the information given. We know the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. 

So, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Now, we need to find the length of the couch. It's mentioned that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than this, so the couch's length is 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"Let's break down the information given: Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She got 2 packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, we need to find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost.

Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

Since the total cost is $7, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"Let's figure out how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make with his budget. He wants to buy the cheapest lumber to save money. 

First, we need to find out how many sticks he can get from each type of wood per dollar. A 2 x 4 piece of wood gives 200 sticks and costs $4, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50. On the other hand, a 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks and costs $6, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67 (round down to 66.67 since we can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood).

Since 66.67 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"Oh my goodness, I'm happy to help Mario with his snowshoe shopping.  To find the total cost, we need to first figure out how many snowshoes he needs. Since each dog has 4 legs and he has 6 dogs, we multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs each dog has: 6 * 4 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes that is. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 24 / 2 = 12.

Now that we know Mario needs 12 pairs of snowshoes, we can find the total cost. Each pair costs $12.00, so we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair: 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how much Janet saves by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips in a week and then subtract that from the cost of the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips in a week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total weekly cost of bus trips is 10 * $2.20 = $22.00.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of a weekly bus pass, which is $20. To find out how much Janet saves, we subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total weekly cost of bus trips: $22.00 - $20 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Hello there. Let's break down the information given. The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has 20 sheep. We also know that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, which means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows. 

Additionally, the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, which makes a total of 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, which makes a total of 80 animals.

To find the total number of animals, we add the number of animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

However, we can simplify this equation by distributing the 4:
x + y = 4x + 4y

Now, let's use the information given about Rose's purchase. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. We can set up the equation as:
x + y = 4x + 4y
12 + 4 = 4x + 4y

Simplifying the equation:
16 = 4x + 4y

Divide both sides by 4:
4 = x + y

Since we know that x + y = 4, we can set up the equation as:
x + y = 4
x = 4 - y

Substituting the value of x in the equation x + y = 4:
(4 - y) + y = 4
4 = 4

This equation is true for any value of y. However, we know that Rose bought 4 potatoes, so we can set y = 4 and find the value of x:
x + 4 = 4
x = 0

So, Sophia bought 0 onions and 4 potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we first need to calculate the number of days he has to lose the weight. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5 calories per day.

The final answer is: 614"
"Let's break down Gerald's situation. He earns $30 per day, and he worked for an entire week, which has 7 days. To find out his total earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he worked:

"Let's break down Julie's expenses step by step.

First, Julie spent 20% of her initial $500 on clothes. To find 20% of $500, we multiply 0.2 by $500, which equals $100. So, she spent $100 on clothes.

Now, we subtract $100 from the initial $500 to find the remaining money: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find 25% of $400, we multiply 0.25 by $400, which equals $100. So, she spent $100 on CDs.

Finally, we subtract $100 from the remaining $400 to find out how much money Julie has left: $400 - $100 = $300.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We're also told that the house cost three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the canvas bags. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. To find the total number of bags, we multiply the number of packs by the number of bags in each pack: 8 * 5 = 40 bags. 

Now, we multiply the total number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost: 40 bags * $4 = $160.

Next, we need to find the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so we multiply the number of bags by the selling price: 40 bags * $8 = $320.

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight in minutes and multiply it by the average number of punches he throws per minute.

The fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375.

"Let's figure out how many cookies Kelsie made. We know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made one-fourth of the number of cookies that Suzanne made. To find out how many cookies Josh made, we need to divide 36 by 4.

36 / 4 = 9

So Josh made 9 cookies. Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to calculate the total from the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

Now, Ali gives his sister half of the total money. To find half of the total money, we divide the total by 2.

Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

Next, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of the remaining money, we multiply the remaining money by 3/5.

3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) * $80 = $48
Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

So, after buying dinner, Ali has $32 left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. To find out how long it takes him in minutes, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Now, we're told that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. To find out how long Royce takes, we need to calculate double the time it takes Rob and then add 40 minutes. Double the time it takes Rob is 2 * 120 = 240 minutes. Adding 40 minutes to that gives us 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of problems Chris has to complete is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

The number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 100 - 61 = 39.

The final answer is: 39"
"It's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm, and I'm excited to help figure out how many quarts of strawberries we can pick per hour. Let's start by looking at how many quarts each of us can pick.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of us can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the Beverly Hills Bakery has left, we need to calculate the total number of loaves sold and then subtract that from the initial number of loaves baked.

First, let's find the total number of loaves sold. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. 

Total loaves sold = 93 + 39 = 132

Now, we need to subtract the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves sold. The grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves.

Total loaves left = Total loaves baked - Total loaves sold - Loaves returned
Total loaves left = 200 - 132 - 6
Total loaves left = 62

The number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"Let's figure out how many rows of flowers Jackson can plant. 

First, we need to find out how many rows of red tulips he can plant. To do this, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6

Next, we need to find out how many rows of blue tulips he can plant. To do this, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. 

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

Heather has a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins in it. A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. Since Heather wants to divide the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. So, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

Daily consumption before adding the device is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Weekly consumption before adding the device is 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour.
Cost before adding the device is 84 * $1.50 = $126.

Daily consumption after adding the device is 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.
Weekly consumption after adding the device is 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour.
Cost after adding the device is 98 * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we need to find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

Since 5 people can work together, their combined work rate is 5 times that of one person. Therefore, 5 people can paint half a house in 5 / 5 = 1 day.

Now, if 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days (because 2 * 0.5 = 1).

To convert the time from days to hours, we multiply the number of days by 24. So, 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set, spending a total of $48. To find out how many more CDs he could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to determine how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

First, let's find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. We subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount spent: $48 - $4 = $44. This is the amount he spent on the headphone set.

Now, let's calculate how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. We divide the amount spent on the headphone set by the cost of one CD: $44 ÷ $4 = 11 CDs.

Next, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on both the headphone set and the CD. We divide the total amount spent by the cost of one CD: $48 ÷ $4 = 12 CDs.

To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we subtract the number of CDs he could have bought with the money spent on the CD from the number of CDs he could have bought with the money spent on the headphone set: 11 - 1 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down Josh's workout routine. He spent 4 hours working out every week except for a few occasions. There was a time when he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, and another time when he spent 6 hours in one week.

To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours, the weeks where he spent 5 hours, and the week where he spent 6 hours.

For the weeks where he spent 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (since 8 - 2 = 6). 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week where he spent 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add up the total hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Now, let's find out how many passengers get on at the second stop. 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times the number of passengers who got off (21) fewer passengers get on. 3 times 21 is 63, so 63 fewer passengers get on. Since we are looking for the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. Instead, we should interpret this as 63 more passengers got on, because you can't have a negative number of passengers.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122.

The final answer is: 122"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age:
   Difference = Jame's current age - cousin's current age
             = 22 - 47
             = -25

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference:
   Difference = | -25 |
             = 25

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer = $2,400
2. Cost of the computer = $1,100
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, we need to find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there are 20 kids in total, and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys went out for the scavenger hunt and brought back 60 shells each. To find the total number of seashells brought by the boys, we multiply the number of boys by the number of shells each brought: 10 * 60 = 600.

Now, we need to find the number of seashells brought by the girls. The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 (the number of shells brought by the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times the number of shells brought by the boys) seashells.

First, let's calculate four times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Now, we add the number of shells brought by the boys to this result: 60 + 240 = 300.

So, the girls brought 300 more seashells than the boys. To find the total number of seashells brought by the girls, we add this to the total number of seashells brought by the boys: 600 + 300 = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls to find the number of seashells brought by each girl: 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we know that Nick had twice as many candies as George. If we let the number of candies George had initially be x, then Nick had 2x candies initially.

When George ate 5 candies, he was left with x - 5 candies. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation x - 5 = 3.

To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation x - 5 = 3. Adding 5 to both sides of the equation gives us x = 8.

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had initially. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's figure out Anne's age. We know Chenny is 10 years old, and Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. To find Alyana's age, we subtract 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we add 2 to Alyana's age to get Anne's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Let's calculate the total thickness of the four books on the shelf.

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 = 81
81 + 45 = 126
126 + 62 = 188

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Emma aims to make 72 vlogs per month. In the first week, she made 18 vlogs, in the second week, she made 21 vlogs, and in the third week, she made 15 vlogs. 

To find the total vlogs made so far, we add the vlogs made in each week: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, we subtract the total vlogs made from the total vlogs Emma aims to make: 72 - 54 = 18

Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount you paid, we need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is calculated by multiplying 0.20 by $50, which equals $10.

Total amount = $50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

You ended up paying $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the eldest boy's initial share is. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to get his initial share. $18 / 3 = $6.

Next, he added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

Then, he added another $10, so he had $11 + $10 = $21.

After that, he spent $8 from his total, so he had $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he had $13 * 3 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we need to determine the amount he saves each day in the first half and then double it.

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's denote the amount saved in the first half as y. Then, the amount saved in the second half will be 2y.

The total amount saved in the first half is xy, and the total amount saved in the second half is 2xy.

The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation: 3xy = 1125.

Since x is the number of days in the first half, and the total number of days in April is 30, we can write x + (30 - x) = 30, which simplifies to 30 = 30, and x = 15.

Now we can substitute x = 15 into the equation 3xy = 1125 to find y: 3(15)y = 1125, which simplifies to 45y = 1125.

To find y, we divide both sides by 45: y = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"Let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Verna bought. She purchased three apples at $1.50 each, five oranges at $0.80 each, and six peaches at $0.75 each.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jairus gets $0.8 for each task he completes, and Jenny gets $0.5 for each task she completes. Both of them finished 20 tasks.

To find out how much Jairus will get in total, we multiply the amount he gets per task by the number of tasks he completed: 0.8 * 20 = $16.

Next, we do the same for Jenny: 0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jairus' total and Jenny's total to see how much more Jairus will get than Jenny. The difference is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's break down the problem. Jeff and Brad are trying to divide 100 dollars between them, and Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of what Jeff and Brad get is 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"

"Let's break down Elise's writing process step by step. 

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters from the first two times, and the 13 letters from the third time. So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. So, the total number of letters she has written is 65 + 65 = 130.

Now, we need to find Mark's initial weight. We know his final weight is 70 pounds, so we add the total weight lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, let's start by calculating the cost of each item.

First, we need to find the cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50. Then, we calculate the cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. Next, we find the cost of 1 calculator at $12 each: 1 * $12 = $12. Finally, we determine the cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each: 1 * $10 = $10.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

However, the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1: 0.1 * $30 = $3.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Daniel has to spend: $30 - $3 = $27.

The final answer is: $27"

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help Bill figure out how many water bottles he needs for his party.

To start, let's calculate the total number of bottles Bill needs. He wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, so he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles for his guests.

Bill also has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he already has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles Bill needs, we need to subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs. So, 140 (total needed) - 48 (he already has) = 92.

However, I made a mistake, the correct calculation is 140 (total needed) - 48 (he already has) = 92."
"To find out how long Ray takes to swim a mile on a hot day, we need to calculate twice the time it takes him to swim a mile on a cold day and add 2 minutes to it. 

Time to swim a mile on a cold day = 16 minutes
Twice the time = 2 * 16 = 32 minutes
Time to swim a mile on a hot day = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day.

Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes
Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes

Now, we can find the difference in time between the two days.

Difference in time = Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day - Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day
= 102 - 48

"Let's count the holes in the buttons. There are 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

Now, let's count the buttons with 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the remaining buttons with 4 holes are 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we add the holes from the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. To find the size of Zack's locker, we need to find half of Timothy's locker size. 

Zack's locker size is 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.

Now, we need to find the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To do this, we'll divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size is 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and her husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. 

If we assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x, then Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, he drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

We are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. So, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"Hello there. Let's count the rodents at the pet shop. We have 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, and 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.

First, let's calculate the number of hamsters: 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters.

Next, we'll calculate the number of guinea pigs: 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs.

Now, let's add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together to find the total number of rodents: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to find their total weight and divide it by 3.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

The total weight of the 3 friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

The average weight of the 3 friends is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the angle the sun moves. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.

The initial angle of the pyramid is 32 degrees from the ground when standing at the entrance of Sahir's house. The sun moves for 10 hours, and we need to calculate the total angle it moves during this time.

Angle moved by the sun per hour = 5 degrees
Number of hours the sun moves = 10 hours

Angle moved by the sun = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees
Final angle from the ground to the sun = Initial angle + Angle moved by the sun
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we need to determine the total number of candles he needs. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are one per year of age, so James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the total pages she read in the first week and then add that to the total pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x. 

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7. 

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.
This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.
This simplifies to x = 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00, so the total for these teeth is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

We know that Richie scored 80 goals. We also know that he scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna.

To find out how many goals Mark scored, we subtract 20 from Richie's total: 80 - 20 = 60.

To find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 45 from Richie's total: 80 - 45 = 35.

Now, let's add up the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $21"
"Let's break down Peter's action figure purchases. He has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures, which cost $5 each. 

In 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures. Since he spent $20, he bought 20 / 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures, which cost $2 each. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left. He has 5 days left, so the total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 50 / 2 = 25.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to first calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses ordered per week is: 
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

"To find the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost. The bread costs $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. The cheese and condiments cost $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need to buy 1 set of cheese and condiments.

Total cost = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.

Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and the cost of the materials and labor.

The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of the materials is $2592 + $432 + $864 = $3888.

The total cost of the labor is $864 + $7344 = $8208.

The total cost to replace the carpet is $3888 + $8208 = $12196.

"Let's figure out the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. 

First, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off. To do this, we'll find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18.
The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. To do this, we'll add 4% of 520 to 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The temperature she should set the oven to is 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature she should set the oven to is 499.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, let's first determine how many pairs of contacts Pete will have. Since 90 single use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day. 

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

Now, let's find the total number of days the contacts will last:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, he will use 2 contacts per day for 90 days, so he will use a total of 180 contacts.

The cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is:
2 boxes * $100/box = $200
10% discount = $200 * 0.10 = $20
$200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns from her activities. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour.

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units there are.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 to find the total amount of water needed.

8 * 100 = 800

"Let's dive into the problem. We have a jar containing red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar says that it contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B. Similarly, since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500. Combining like terms, we get 3.01B = 4500. Dividing both sides by 3.01, we find that B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is 0.99 * 1500 = 1485, and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1515 - 1485 = 30.

Weight lost per week: -1.25 pounds
Weight gained per week: 1.75 pounds

Now, let's multiply the weight change per week by the number of weeks to find the total weight change for each option:
-1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds (lost)
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds (gained)

Now, let's find the difference in weight between the two options:
8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we first need to determine how much protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's solve the problem. 

Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600. To find the remaining amount he needs to pay, we subtract the deposit from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, let's calculate how many hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount. He makes $15 per hour at work. To find the number of hours, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a triangle, and we know that the sum of its three angles is 180 degrees. One angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle.

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Then, the other two angles are 2x and 3x.

The sum of the three angles is x + 2x + 3x = 180. Combining like terms, we get 6x = 180.

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 6. This gives us x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees, and the other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

Since we're looking for the largest angle, we compare the three angles: 30, 60, and 90 degrees. The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's calculate how many gumballs Colby can buy. 

First, we need to find the total amount of money he has in cents. 

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

The final answer is: 69"
"Hello there. Let's count the total number of legs in the pet store. We have 5 dogs, and each dog has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs from the dogs is 5 x 4 = 20.

Next, we have 2 cats, and each cat has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs from the cats is 2 x 4 = 8.

Lastly, we have 10 birds, and each bird has 2 legs. So, the total number of legs from the birds is 10 x 2 = 20.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to 8 pounds gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than this, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"Hello there. Let's break down Steve's game collection over the next three years. 

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 24 = 29 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 48 = 53 games in the third year.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve gets in 3 years: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

The additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. Since he makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, we can divide 120 by 2 to get the hourly rate. 

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. It's given that she makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 

To find Marissa's hourly rate, we multiply Ruiz's hourly rate by 3/4. 
60 pounds/hour * (3/4) = 45 pounds/hour.

Now that we know both of their hourly rates, we can find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds/hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
Marissa makes 45 pounds/hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

To find the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together, we add their individual totals. 
720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"Let's break down Howard's spending at the arcade. On Monday, he spent $8. On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16. On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

To find the total amount he spent, we add these amounts together: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Since Howard originally had $100, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount to find out how much he has left: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down Patrick's lemonade sales. For the first four hours, he sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. To find the total amount earned in this period, we need to multiply the number of cups sold by the price per cup.

Total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total amount earned in 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. We'll calculate the total amount earned in this period similarly.

Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total amount earned in 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, we add the total amount earned in both periods to find the overall amount earned in 6 hours.

Total amount earned in 6 hours = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires can handle in a month and then divide that by the total number of rotations allowed.

First, let's find the number of rotations per month. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per 2 miles.

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/2 miles
Rotations per month = 290,000 rotations/month

Now, we can find the number of months the tires can last before they need to be replaced by dividing the total number of rotations allowed by the rotations per month.

Months before replacement = 10,440,000 rotations / 290,000 rotations/month
Months before replacement = 36 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = 36 months / 12 months/year
Years before replacement = 3 years

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the cost per pump of the shampoo, we need to first determine the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equal to 2400 cents. 

To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price, which is $25. To find 30% of $25, we multiply 0.3 by $25, which equals $7.5.

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt by subtracting the discount from the original price: $25 - $7.5 = $17.5.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the items. We add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.5 + $35 = $52.5.

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately. Now, let's find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase. We subtract the total cost from the amount Joe has: $50 - $52.5 = -$2.5.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.5"
"To determine the amount of butter Juan needs to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of dozen croissants per day by the number of days:

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Now, we convert the total number of dozen croissants to individual croissants:
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Next, we find the amount of butter needed per dozen croissants, which is 1/4 pound. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street: 194 * 490 = $95,060

To find how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to first find the cost to repave Monica's street and then subtract that from the cost to repave Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street: 194 * 150 = $29,100

Now, subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street: 
$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. John initially receives $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. However, his research takes 10 times longer than expected, which means it lasts for 5 * 10 = 50 months in total.

The first 5 months are covered by the initial funding of $100,000. For the remaining 45 months, the funding increases by 50% of the initial amount. 50% of $100,000 is $50,000, so the new funding is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

To find the total cost for the remaining 45 months, we multiply the increased funding by the number of months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The final answer is: $6,850,000"

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used in a year and then multiply it by the cost of a gallon of water.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times in a year (since there are 52 weeks in a year).

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15, so the total cost of water used in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

"Let's break down the costs of all the items Scarlett bought.

First, she found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale. Then, she went to the pet store and bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each, which is a total of 2 x $2.50 = $5.00. Next, she bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each, which is 3 x $2.00 = $6.00. 

After that, she purchased 20 fish at $0.50 each, which is 20 x $0.50 = $10.00. Finally, she needed fish food that cost $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we first need to find the total number of seats. There are 4 rows of seats, and each row has 18 seats.

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Now, let's find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators.

Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

The remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the parents, we need to find one-third of the remaining seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats
Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Now, we can find the number of seats occupied by the students by subtracting the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.

Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

"Let's break down Jim's gum-chewing habits. He spends 8 hours at school, and he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours. So, we need to divide the total school hours by 2 to find out how many pieces he chews at school.
8 hours / 2 = 4 pieces of gum

In addition to the gum he chews at school, Jim also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner. That's 2 more pieces. 
Total pieces chewed so far: 4 + 2 = 6

Jim starts with a 20-piece pack of gum. We subtract the pieces he's already chewed: 
20 - 6 = 14

Later that day, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find out how many pieces he gives her, we need to divide 14 by 2:

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you figure out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

To do this, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be and then divide that by his growth rate.

The roller coaster requires riders to be at least 4 feet tall, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches). Adam is currently 40 inches tall and grows 2 inches every year.

To find out how many inches Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Now, we divide the difference in height by Adam's growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height: 8 / 2 = 4 years.

So, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"Let's break down James' earnings from selling the used cars.

First, we need to find the total cost of the cars. Since James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, the total cost is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we need to calculate the company's cost to acquire the cars. They paid 30% of the total cost, which is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

Now, let's find the profit from selling the cars. This is the total cost minus the company's cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, we need to calculate James' commission on the profit. He earns a 10% commission, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that when a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. This means 25% of 100 riders can stay on the wave.

To find 25% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.25:
100 * 0.25 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is:
25 - 15 = 10

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, and the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell, we can calculate the price of the gold Jewell as follows:

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Given that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold, we can calculate the price of the silver Jewell as follows:

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

"Let's break down the information given. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. 

To find the number of rose stamps, we need to determine how many fewer rose stamps Max bought compared to truck stamps. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Max bought: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Tom is driving at a speed of 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving 55 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, we need to find out how long it will take for Tom to catch up.

To do this, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. This is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.

Now, we can use the formula Time = Distance / Relative Speed to find the time it will take for Tom to catch up. The distance between them is 75 miles, and the relative speed is 15 mph.

Time = Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."

"Let's break down the problem. Manny signed up for 10 Karate classes for a total of $60. His parents told him that if the classes cost more than $10 per class, they won't sign him up again. 

To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Since Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's say Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and y classes at $10 per class. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

6x + 10y = 60

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 1, 6(1) + 10y = 60
6 + 10y = 60
10y = 54
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 6(2) + 10y = 60
12 + 10y = 60
10y = 48
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 6(3) + 10y = 60
18 + 10y = 60
10y = 42
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 4, 6(4) + 10y = 60
24 + 10y = 60
10y = 36
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

The maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine how many customers each person processes in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie's daily production is 50 * 2 = 100 customers.

Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"Let's break down the information given. Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which means Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total. So, Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

"To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to multiply the cost of 4 apples by 5/4. 
Cost of 4 apples = $5.20
Cost of 5 apples = $5.20 * (5/4) = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to multiply the cost of 3 oranges by 5/3.
Cost of 3 oranges = $3.30
Cost of 5 oranges = $3.30 * (5/3) = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the hole) is found by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can find the total time it will take him to dig the hole by multiplying the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

The final answer is: 216"
"Let's break down the costs of Bill's new truck. The base price of the truck is $30,000. 

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500. 

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Let's break down Tim's new compensation package. He's getting a 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary, which is a significant boost. To calculate the raise, we multiply his monthly salary by 0.05:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
This means his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

In addition to the raise, Tim is also receiving a bonus worth half a month's salary. Since half of $20,000 is $10,000, his total monthly income will be:
Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:
Total annual income = Total monthly income * 12 = $31,000 * 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"
"Let's break down the costs of James' new wardrobe.

First, we need to find the cost of the suits. James bought 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, which is $750 * 1/5 = $150 per pair. Since James bought 10 pairs of dress pants, the total cost of the pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James bought 3 dress shirts for each of the 10 suits, so he bought a total of 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we add up the costs of the suits, pants, and shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"
"Hello there. To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website is 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles.

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company is 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles.

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites: 560 articles (news website) + 280 articles (sister company) = 840 articles.

"Let's break down the information given. Steve is 60 years old, and his wife is 4 years older than him, which makes her 64 years old.

Since their son is half as old as his mom, we can calculate his age by dividing his mom's age by 2. So, the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Now, we know that Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. To find her age, we subtract 3 from her husband's age: 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to first find the total amount of flour in one bag and then multiply it by 3.

Each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, so the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3 to find the total amount of flour in three bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is: 48"

Fishio initially posted a selfie on Instagram and received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes increased significantly. We know that the number of likes after 3 weeks was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes.

To find the number of likes after 3 weeks, we multiply the initial number of likes by 70. 
2000 * 70 = 140000.

Now, we need to find the total number of likes after Fishio received 20000 more new likes recently. To do this, we add the 20000 new likes to the total number of likes after 3 weeks.
140000 + 20000 = 160000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. However, she received a $2 discount due to a voucher. To find the total cost, we need to subtract the discount from the total price:
20 * $20 = $400
$400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of pomegranates increased to $30 each, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. First, we need to calculate the total cost without the discount:
20 * $30 = $600
Next, we calculate the discount, which is 10% of $600:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$600 - $60 = $540

To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we subtract the cost of the first day from the cost of the second day:
$540 - $398 = $142

"Let's break down Ariadne's sales. In a particular month, her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total sales from green hats in that month ""x"". Then, the sales from red hats in that month is $400, which is half of x, so x/2 = $400.

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = $400 * 2 = $800.

So, in that month, Ariadne's total sales from green hats were $800 and from red hats were $400.

The total sales in that month are $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

To find out how much was withheld from her wage, we need to calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received.

First, let's find out how much she should have had in her account if she received her full wage. 

Expected wage: $300
Initial amount in the account: $200
Expected total: $300 + $200 = $500

Since she actually has $420 in her account, we can find the difference between the expected total and the actual amount to determine how much was withheld.

Actual amount: $420
Expected total: $500
Withheld amount: $500 - $420 = $80

"To determine how many eggs Lori needs for her party, we first need to figure out how many deviled egg halves her guests will eat. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she's inviting 16 guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves per guest.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Now, we know that Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. To find out how many eggs she needs, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

Number of deviled egg halves needed: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day

"To find the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly hanger rental is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for a year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, so it is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for a year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we add the initial purchase price, the hanger rental cost, and the fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"Let's break down the information given: Finley went to the grocery store and bought rice, beans, and pork for use in their home. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, while beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. If it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, we need to find the total cooking time for all the food.

First, let's find the cooking time for pork. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, and it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.

Next, we need to find the cooking time for beans. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20. Since Lee only rears sheep and geese, we can represent the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, so the total number of legs can be represented as 4S + 2G = 70.

Each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, so the total number of heads can be represented as S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42. 
The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

"Let's solve the problem. We're given that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Sally has.

Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 2x + 3 books. Since we know Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mrs. Jameson's bamboo grows 30 inches a day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we first need to convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 4 + 8 = 12.

When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. This means there are a total of 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12 + 28 = 40.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means the total number of toys needed is 40 - 3 = 37.

The final answer is: 37"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that three people invested a total of $1200 in a joint savings account. 

First, we need to find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we can calculate this as follows: (2/5) * 1200 = 480.

Now, we need to find out how much money was left after Dylan's investment. This can be calculated by subtracting Dylan's investment from the total amount: 1200 - 480 = 720.

Next, we need to find out how much Frances invested. Since Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, we can calculate this as follows: (2/3) * 720 = 480.

Now, we need to find out how much money was left after Frances' investment. This can be calculated by subtracting Frances' investment from the remaining amount: 720 - 480 = 240.

So, Skyler's investment is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"Hi there, I'm Isabelle. I'd be happy to help the sisters, Carol and Jennifer, figure out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach their goal.

Let's start by adding up the number of signatures each sister has collected so far. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we'll subtract the total signatures they already have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal.

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's figure out how many hash browns we can make from 96 potatoes. 

To do this, we need to find the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows: 

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

Now, let's use this ratio to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes. We can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

We can then cross-multiply to solve for x:

6x = 96 * 36
6x = 3456
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: 576"
"Let's calculate the total weight of the 9 adults riding the elevator. 

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the difference between the total weight of the 9 adults and the maximum load.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's figure out how many cookies they have in total. We know Katarina has 68 cookies. 

Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
The Cookie Monster has 12 less cookies than Max, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up the number of cookies each person has: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298

The final answer is: 298"
"I'd be happy to help Shania with her dress design. To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the added length. The dress was extended by 50% of its original length and then 20cm was added to the bottom. 

Let's call the original length 'x'. The extension is 50% of x, which is 0.5x. Adding 20cm to this extension gives us 0.5x + 20.

The final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: x + (0.5x + 20) = 140.

Combine like terms: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120.

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Chris can mow his entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes) in ""turtle"" mode, or 40 minutes in ""rabbit"" mode. Today, he decided to mow half the lawn in each mode.

First, let's find the time it took for each mode. Since he mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the time it takes for John and Jack to get to the fire station. They spend 6 minutes getting to the corner where the library is, and then another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

So, the total time they've spent so far is 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes.

Now, let's find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late. They have 30 minutes in total to get to school. 

Time left to get to school = Total time they have - Time to get to the fire station
Time left to get to school = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left to get to school = 11 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, we need to find the age of one of the twins.

Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

We have two pieces of information: the sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44, and the older twin is 7 years older than the triplet. 

The first piece of information can be written as an equation: T + (T+7) + t = 44

The second piece of information can be written as an equation: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, we need to find the age of the older twin. 

The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"Hello there. Let's break down the problem step by step. Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies that cost a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. 

First, we need to find the cost of one candy. To do this, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. This is the cost of 4 candies. 

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Rong saves 20 coins every month, and Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we need to calculate 2/5 of 20, which is 8. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"Let's break down John's vet bill. He needs 2 vaccines, which cost $20 each, so that's a total of 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of his total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits in it. 

First, let's find the cost of one banana. Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs twice as much, which is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we find the cost of one orange, which is three times as much as a banana. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

First, let's start with the red squares: there are 14 of them.

Next, we know there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

Then, there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

Lastly, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add the number of squares of each color together: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

The total number of squares is 68. Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many more chairs Mia's restaurant needs to get for the function.

First, let's find out how many regular chairs the restaurant has. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can multiply the number of high chairs by 5.

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed. We have 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function, so we need to add those together.

Total number of chairs needed = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57

Next, we'll find out how many chairs the restaurant already has. We know there are 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs, so we add those together.

Total number of chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

Now, let's find out how many more chairs Mia's restaurant needs to get.

Number of chairs needed to be added = Total number of chairs needed - Total number of chairs available
= 57 - 48

"Let's break down the points collected by each student in class 3B.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 0.3 by 50, which equals 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. To find Tom's points, we subtract 30 from Betty's points: 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. To find Martha's points, we multiply Tom's points by 3: 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by the class: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"I'm happy to help you figure out how many fireworks Hannah will see on the 4th of July. To do this, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which is 0.4 * 300 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard display. She will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard display is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display: 120 + 15 = 135.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

To find the capacity of Gary's truck, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds
Capacity of Gary's truck = Total capacity - Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know there are 8 males and 6 females in the group. To find the total number of people, we add the number of males and females together: 8 + 6 = 14.

Next, we're told that each female ate 3 dumplings. To find the total number of dumplings eaten by females, we multiply the number of females by the number of dumplings each female ate: 6 * 3 = 18.

Now, we know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. So, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. To find the total number of dumplings eaten by males, we multiply the number of males by the number of dumplings each male ate: 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten by all people is the sum of the dumplings eaten by females and males: 18 + 32 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry must be equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying 100 by 3/5.

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * 100 = 60

After spending $10 on a book, Gerald is left with:

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10 = 50

To do that, we'll divide the cat's speed by 5. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = Speed of the turtle * 40
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

"To find out how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to determine how much they raise per hour. They've raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. To find the hourly rate, we divide the total amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they've already raised $2100. The remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they've already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Now, we need to find out what percentage of this 40% is used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we need to find out how much of the 40% is used for industrial purposes. Since 80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes, we can calculate this by multiplying 40% by 0.8. 

0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%. This means 32% of the river's total water is used by the city for industrial purposes.

Now, to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 
40% - 32% = 8%.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two types of ice cream being produced: chocolate and vanilla.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate of chocolate ice cream, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

Now, let's look at the production rate of vanilla ice cream. The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate of vanilla ice cream, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now that we have the production rates for both types of ice cream, we can calculate the total quarts produced in 48 hours. For chocolate ice cream, it would be 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts. For vanilla ice cream, it would be 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts.

To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream together: 2400 + 600 = 3000.

Then, he bought 3 mini quiches for $4.00 each, so the total cost of mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.

Finally, he purchased 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each, so the total cost of blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you figure out how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy.

Let's break it down: Erin has $6.00 and each scoop costs $1.50. To find out how many scoops she can buy, we need to divide $6.00 by $1.50.

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so Erin can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. To take advantage of the deal, Erin should buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops. 

The remaining $1.50 can be used to buy 1 more scoop, making it a total of 4 scoops.

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day.

To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in two weeks. Two weeks is equal to 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces of candy each person has left. Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Mr. Boarden's bathroom remodeling. To determine the number of mosaic tiles he needs, we first need to find the area he wants to cover. Since he wants to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we calculate this as (2/3) * 36.

To do this, we multiply 2 by 36, which gives us 72, and then divide by 3. 72 divided by 3 is 24. So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 sq ft.

For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 sq ft, he would need 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"Let's calculate how much James saved by picking blueberries himself.

First, we need to find the total cost of picking the blueberries. The initial cost is $20, and then there's an additional $1.5 per pound. Since James picked 30 pounds, the total cost of picking the blueberries is $20 + $1.5 * 30 = $20 + $45 = $65.

Now, let's find the cost of buying the blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries for $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds, so the total cost at the store would be $2.5 * 30 = $75.

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store: $75 - $65 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total amount of money the company paid, we need to first find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. The new price is 10% higher than the original price. 

10% of $700 is 0.1 x 700 = $70. 

The new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers. 

The total amount is 500 x $770 = $385,000.

The final answer is: $385,000"
"Hello there. Let's calculate the total calories in John's 6-egg omelet. 

First, we need to find the calories from the eggs. Since each egg is 75 calories, 6 eggs would be 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

Next, we have the cheese and ham. John used 2 oz of each, and the cheese is 120 calories per oz, while the ham is 40 calories per oz. So, the cheese contributes 2 * 120 = 240 calories, and the ham contributes 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Now, let's add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The final answer is: 770"

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many people accept the position at Google.

First, we need to find out how many people receive interviews out of the 100 applicants. Since 30% of the applicants receive interviews, we can calculate this as follows:

30% of 100 = 0.3 * 100 = 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we need to find out how many of those who receive interviews receive a job offer. Since 20% of those who receive interviews receive a job offer, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, we need to find out how many of those who receive a job offer accept the position. Since a third of those who receive a job offer accept the position, we can calculate this as follows:

A third of 6 = 6 / 3 = 2 people accept the position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother, we need to know the total number of sacks she gave away. 

She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. 
Total sacks given away = 3 + 4 = 7 sacks

Since there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, we need to multiply the total sacks given away by the weight of each sack.

Total kilograms given away = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

The final answer is: 175"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question. To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to compare the number of boxes she bought in both weeks.

This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, which is a total of 3 + 5 = 8 boxes.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

So, to find the difference, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week: 8 - 4 = 4.

"Bonjour! Let's calculate the total number of times Helga taps her feet while dancing. 

When Helga's arms are at her sides, she can tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute and her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute. This results in a total of 550 taps per minute. For the 3 minutes her arms are down, she taps a total of 550 * 3 = 1650 times.

When Helga raises her arms, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot. This means she taps a total of 400 times per minute. For the 2 minutes her arms are up, she taps a total of 400 * 2 = 800 times.

To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we add the total taps from both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"Let's break down the situation. Ron is worried about the pothole in front of his house, as it's going to cause $450 worth of damage to his car if it's not fixed. However, the city council won't take care of it, and if Ron decides to fix it himself, he'll be fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance. On top of that, he'll need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.

To calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole, we need to add the fine and the cost of the asphalt. The fine is $120, and the cost of the asphalt is 3 * $25 = $75. So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, let's compare this to the potential damage to his car. If the pothole isn't fixed, it will cost Ron $450. Since fixing the pothole costs $195, we can find out how much money Ron saves by subtracting the cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is: $255"
"Let's calculate the number of chairs left in the restaurant.

The restaurant initially had 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. To find the total number of chairs, we add these two numbers together: 170 + 23 = 193.

Now, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair. 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs were sent, so we subtract these from the total: 193 - 20 - 13 = 160.

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends). 

First, let's find out how many slices Bryce and two friends ate. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

40 slices - 24 slices = 16 slices

Now, we know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

Total number of slices = 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices
Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 16 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. To find out how long it takes a dog to eat the same number of sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat.

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog. To do this, we add the time taken by the cat and the dog, and then divide by 2.

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. To make calculations easier, we'll convert this to just inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply 8 by 12 to get 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches to that gives us a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each, and Hannah smashed a quarter of the windows. To find the total number of windows smashed from students' cars, we multiply the number of students' cars by the number of windows per car and then multiply by the fraction of windows smashed: (1/4) * (64 * 4) = (1/4) * 256 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each, and Hannah smashed three-fourths of the windows. To find the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars, we multiply the number of teachers' cars by the number of windows per car and then multiply by the fraction of windows smashed: (3/4) * (32 * 2) = (3/4) * 64 = 48.

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars: 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to first determine the total number of blue spools. We can do this by adding the number of light blue and dark blue spools together.

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. This can be done by adding the number of light blue, dark blue, light green, and dark green spools together.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 5000 people lined up at a polling station to cast their vote on election day.

First, we need to find out how many people voted by midday. 2/5 of the people had voted by then. To calculate this, we multiply 2/5 by 5000.

2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, we need to find out how many people were left after midday. This is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by midday.

5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were left after midday.

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining people voted by 16:00. 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by then. To calculate this, we multiply 2/3 by 3000.

2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

Now, we need to find out how many people had not voted by 16:00. This is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.

5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000

"To figure out how many boxes of graham crackers we need, let's start by calculating the total number of smores required. 

9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.
The total number of smores required is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, the total number of sleeves needed is 24 / 8 = 3.
Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the total number of boxes needed is 3 / 3 = 1.

2 * 15 = 30
30 + 8 = 38

So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

We also know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
38 - 4 = 34

Therefore, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Boris initially has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so we need to find out how many apples Beck has. 

To do that, we subtract 23 from Boris's initial amount of apples: 100 - 23 = 77. 

So, Beck has 77 apples. 

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. We add 10 to Beck's current amount of apples: 77 + 10 = 87.

Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's amount from Boris's amount: 90 - 87 = 3.

First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube. For giant cubes, he makes 3 cubes, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 ounces. For medium cubes, he makes 7 cubes, so that's 7 * 2 = 14 ounces. For small cubes, he makes 8 cubes, and since each uses 1/2 an ounce, that's 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

Let's start by finding the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can find the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 
Cost of a gallon jar = $5
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, we can find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.
Total cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5 = $50
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48

"Let's break down the information given: a class of 50 students has various hobbies. 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the rest like to either play video games or play music. We also know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball.

Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, we can calculate it as follows: students who like to play music = 2 * (students who like to play basketball) = 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, let's find the total number of students who like to either play video games or play music. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of students who like to bake and play basketball from the total number of students: students who like to play video games or music = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball) = 50 - (10 + 5) = 50 - 15 = 35.

Since we know that students who like to play music = 10, students who like to play video games = students who like to play video games or music - students who like to play music = 35 - 10 = 25.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: 224 (Carl) + 112 (Cal) = 336.

The final answer is: 336"
"To find out how many more groups are needed, we first need to determine the number of students per group. We have a total of 54 students and we want to divide them into 6 groups. 

Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we are told that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students, we multiply the number of groups by the students per group.

Total students = Number of groups * Students per group
Total students = 12 * 9
Total students = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups.

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

Since each group requires 9 students, we need to find the number of additional groups required.

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by 8.

In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. 

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekend days: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, multiply the total chairs rented in a week by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month):
500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"Let's break down the events step by step to find out how many bananas Gunther had at the end.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas, so the number of bananas left is 48 / 2 = 24.

Gunther added 25 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 24 + 25 = 49.

Arnold stole 12 bananas, so the number of bananas left is 49 - 12 = 37.

Gunther added 6 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 37 + 6 = 43.

The final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to divide the monthly electricity bill by the number of roommates and then multiply the result by 12.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the bill equally among themselves.

$100 / 4 = $25 per roommate per month.

Now, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 to find the yearly amount:

$25 * 12 = $300 per roommate per year.

The final answer is: $300"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many glasses and plates Jeff sent to the party. Since he sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates, we can calculate the total number of each item by multiplying the number of dozen by 12.

Glasses: 8 dozen * 12 = 96 glasses
Plates: 4 dozen * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items from the total number of items sent. We know that 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken.

Glasses left: 96 - 10 = 86
Plates left: 48 - 6 = 42

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

The final answer is: 
86"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30 small stickers, we multiply 0.9 by 30, which equals 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. To find 50% of 40 large stickers, we multiply 0.5 by 40, which equals 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

Next, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers, 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons. To find the total number of buttons she has, we add these together: 3 + 20 + 27 + 20 = 70.

To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add the matches played on Monday, Friday, and Saturday. 

Joey played 2 matches on Monday. 
He played 1 match on Friday. 
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches played on each day: 
2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the council has 33 members and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. 

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you figure out how many shirts Krissa needs to order for her preschool students.

Let's start by calculating the number of students for each size. We know that 11 students need extra-small shirts. Since twice as many students need size small as extra small, that's 2 * 11 = 22 students.

Next, we know that four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so that's 22 - 4 = 18 students.

Then, half as many students need size large as size medium, which is 18 / 2 = 9 students.

Finally, six more students need size extra-large than large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 students.

Now, let's add the number of students for each size together: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the final price after the discount, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The bag is marked at $140 and has a 5% discount. 

To find the discount, multiply the original price by the discount percentage (5% or 0.05).

Discount = $140 * 0.05 = $7

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price.

Final price = Original price - Discount
Final price = $140 - $7
Final price = $133

"Let's break down the information given. We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win the big race. To find this number, we multiply 0.2 by 50, which equals 10 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, the remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40.

60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. To find this number, we multiply 0.6 by 40, which equals 24 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. Since 24 people think horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 40 - 24 = 16 people.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we found that there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jayden initially had $70 from selling his pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for the three houses is 250. 

We can represent the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles.

The third house needs double the first, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

Now, we can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Ezra read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more. To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to determine how many books he read in the same hour as Ezra.

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can find Ahmed's total by dividing Ezra's total by 2. 

Ahmed's books = 300 / 2 = 150

Now, we know that Ezra will read a total of 300 + 150 = 450 books.

To find the total number of books both Ezra and Ahmed read, we simply add their individual totals together.

Total books read by Ahmed = 150
Total books read by Ezra = 450
Total books read by both = 150 + 450 = 600

"Let's break down Tanya's earnings for the two days of teaching.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches only 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not earn an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add the earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so they sold a total of 5 * 4 = 20 vanilla scents.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so they sold a total of 2 * 8 = 16 fruity scents.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold.

Difference = Number of vanilla scents sold - Number of fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

To reach his goal of $135, Bennet needs to make an additional $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

Since he has 25 ears of corn, we need to find out how much he should sell each ear for. To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"Let's break down Tatiana's weekend schedule. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which gives her a total of 12 hours for the weekend.

Tatiana spends 3 hours reading, leaving her with 9 hours for other activities. Since she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, we can calculate that as 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

Now, let's find out how much time she spends playing soccer. We subtract the time spent reading and playing video games from the total available time: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

So, the correct answer is 50%."

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

Time to drive to the museum: 
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 / 75 = 2 hours

Time to drive back home:
Distance to the museum = 150 miles
Speed = 75 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 150 / 75 = 2 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection.

First, we need to find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we'll divide the total number of movies by 3:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:
200 * $6 = $1200

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

Now, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we'll multiply the remaining movies by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot. 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

Let's break it down step by step. Ava and Emma are playing a video game, and they each receive points for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and finishing the level within a certain time. 

Ava gets 10 points for every enemy she jumps on, 5 points for every berry she collects, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when she finishes the level. 

Emma jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava and collects 3 fewer berries than Ava, but finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava. 

Let's assume Emma's score is x. Then Ava's score can be represented as (x + 8) for the enemies, (x + 3) for the berries, and (60 - (x + 4)) for the timer. 

However, we don't need to calculate the exact scores for Ava and Emma. We can find the difference in their scores by finding the difference in their enemy and berry scores, and the difference in their timer scores.

The difference in their enemy scores is 8.
The difference in their berry scores is 3.
The difference in their timer scores is (60 - (x + 4)) - 60 = -4.

The difference in their scores is 8 + 3 - 4 = 7.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known.

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas.

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. To find the total number of times they ride on these days, we multiply the number of times they ride per day by the number of days: 3 * 5 = 15.

However, they also ride twice the times they do on usual days on two other days. This means they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times a day on these extra days. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we add the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days: 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's dive into the problem. We know Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. He then bought some more fish from the pet store, where a sales assistant dipped out 17 fish from a mixed tank. After adding these fish to his pond, Bob found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O. We can set up two equations based on this information.

First, we know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so W + O = 17.

Second, since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can write the equation: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We can solve the second equation for O: O = 2(4 + W) - 3 = 8 + 2W - 3 = 5 + 2W.

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the first equation: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combine like terms: 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello there. To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

The distance between his home and office is 5 miles, and he travels this distance twice a day (to and from work), so the total daily distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost per week: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt. 

First, we need to find the total value of the quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter: 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, we need to find the total value of the twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply the number of twenties by the value of each twenty: 10 * $20 = $200.

Now, we know Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find the amount she spent, we multiply the total value of the twenties by 3/5: 3/5 * $200 = $120.

Finally, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent to find the total amount of money she paid for lunch: $35 + $120 = $155.

To find the number of smart TVs sold, we multiply one-fourth by the total number of TVs: 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.

To find the number of analog TVs sold, we multiply one-eighth by the total number of TVs: 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with that problem. 

To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Half of the trip cost = $300 / 2 = $150

The school will cover $150, and John has $50. To find out how much John is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the amount the school will cover:

Amount John is missing = Amount school will cover - Amount John has
= $150 - $50
= $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to find the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point. 

The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder, so it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

The temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of seashells, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find the number of groups. We know that 90 people need to be split into groups, and each group has 9 people. 

Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we need to find the number of groups that brought back seashells. We know that 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells. 

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells. Each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells.

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's calculate the number of people on the train.

Initially, there were 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

The number of people on the train is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's calculate how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month. 

Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day on his way home, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. To find the total amount of money he makes, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the value of each bottle cap and then multiply the result by the number of days in the month.

First, let's calculate the daily amount: 10 * $0.25 = $2.50 per day.

Now, let's multiply the daily amount by the number of days in the month: $2.50 * 30 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. 150% of $20 is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. For 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"Hello there. I'm Isabelle, the zookeeper here at the local wildlife sanctuary. I'm happy to help you with your question about the lion enclosure. 

To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to count the female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. We have 12 female lions. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can find the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2: 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.
We also have 14 lion cubs.

Now, let's add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions: 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find out how much money Mike will have left over after buying his favorite jeans, we need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

First, let's find the discount amount: 
Discount = 25% of $40
Discount = 0.25 * $40
Discount = $10

Now, let's find the price after the discount:
Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

Now, let's find out how much money Mike will have left over:
Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. To find the total salary for each month, we multiply the number of employees by the salary per employee:
260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help Carrie plan the caroling schedule. To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, and they plan to sing it twice. So, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long. 

Now, let's add the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find Billy's hourly wage after his raises. He was initially paid $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Then, on his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Sally's hourly wage. Her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Next, we need to find their total earnings after working 20 hours. Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230. Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Pierson scored 278 points in a game of bowling. Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson.

First, we need to find half of Pierson's score. To do this, we divide 278 by 2. 

278 / 2 = 139

Now, we need to find Nikita's score. Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so we add 11 to 139.

139 + 11 = 150

To find the total score, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"Let's calculate the total number of trees planted at Ashley's school.

First, we need to find the total number of students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class, so we multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class.

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is equal to the total number of students.

Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Next, we need to find the total number of teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class, so we multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class.

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is twice the total number of teachers.

Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers to find the total number of trees planted.

Total trees planted = Total trees planted by students + Total trees planted by teachers
Total trees planted = 1000 + 240
Total trees planted = 1240

The final answer is: 1240"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30% or more.

"Hello there, I'm Isabelle. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total hours Kris played in 2 weeks. Since there are 14 days in 2 weeks, and Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the total hours Kris played in 1 week. There are 7 days in a week, and Kris plays for 2 hours every day, so she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in 2 weeks and 1 week: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two cars on the highway, with the first car traveling at 60 miles per hour and the second car passing it at 70 miles per hour. We want to find out how many miles will separate them after 2 hours.

First, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. The distance traveled is equal to the speed multiplied by the time. So, for the first car:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars will be the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the ring, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the 30% premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. 

First, we add the cost of the diamond and the gold: $600 + $300 = $900.

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium. To do this, we multiply the total cost of the diamond and gold by 0.3: 0.3 * $900 = $270.

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold: $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have the results of the standardized test from Herbert Hoover Elementary School. 

First, we need to find the number of students who passed in each grade. We know that 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, and 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed. 

For the fifth-graders, we're told that their pass rate is twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders. Since 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, the pass rate for the fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. This means 80 out of 400 fifth-graders passed.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Milo wants to make a mosaic that's three inches tall, and it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. He has two bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips.

First, we need to find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since he has two bags, we multiply the number of chips in one bag by 2.

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we know that 12 glass chips are needed to make one square inch of the mosaic. To find out how many square inches Milo can make, we divide the total number of chips by 12.

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height.

Area = length * height
12 = length * 3
length = 12 / 3
length = 4

So, Milo can make a mosaic that's 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 4 students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

Next, 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party. To do this, we add the amount of tea drank to the amount of tea left. 

The amount of tea left is 10 quarts. 

Total tea at the beginning = 38 (tea drank) + 10 (tea left) = 48 quarts.

Now, we convert quarts to gallons by dividing by 4. 

48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies. Then, he sold 150 of them. To find out how many candies he has left, we need to subtract the number of candies he sold from the initial number of candies he ordered.

100 (initial candies) - 150 (candies sold) = -50

However, we can't have a negative number of candies, so this means Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold. Let's continue with the problem.

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. To find the total number of candies he has now, we add the initial number of candies to the additional number of candies he ordered.

100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200

Now, we need to find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell to sell all of his candy. We subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he has.

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We start with 10 students at the beginning of the year. Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

Now, let's find the number of additional students by subtracting the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"Let's break down the problem. Felix charges $0.25 for every branch he has to climb to retrieve an item from a tree. He made a total of $105 during the week. To find out how many branches he climbed in total, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch.

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers. Rose starts by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each, which gives us 3 * 5 = 15 petals. Then, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each, resulting in 4 * 6 = 24 petals. Next, she adds 5 flowers with 4 petals each, giving us 5 * 4 = 20 petals. Finally, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each, which amounts to 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

However, Rose drops 1 petal from each set of flowers, so we need to subtract 4 petals from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals.

The final answer is: 97"
"Let's figure out how many S'mores each kid can have. First, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean make their S'mores and drop some on the ground.

John and DeSean each make 9 S'mores, so together they use 18 marshmallows. They also drop 3 marshmallows, so in total, they use 21 marshmallows. To find out how many marshmallows are left, we subtract 21 from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Marshmallows used and dropped = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Now, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have.

Total marshmallows left = 14
Number of kids = 2
S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have four people playing games at the arcade: Jack and his three friends. Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. Two of his friends are not as skilled and can only play for half the time, which is 10 minutes per quarter. The other friend is more skilled and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes with one quarter.

They all play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 

Now, let's calculate the total time played by each person. Jack plays for 240 minutes. The two less skilled friends play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. The more skilled friend plays for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played is 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

The total amount of money used is 840 * 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"Let's break down the information given: Tanya makes a salt scrub that fills a 10-ounce jar. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She also uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Hello there. Let's calculate the total amount of money John spent at the market.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

Cost of goats: 3 goats * $500 = $1500
Cost of cows: 2 cows * $1500 = $3000

Total cost: $1500 + $3000 = $4500

"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

First, let's add up the number of cupcakes Paul already has: 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. That's a total of 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we subtract the number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which gives us 8 cars sold.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

So, Joe gives away a total of 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem. The charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. To find out how much the students raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations from the total.

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

This means the students raised $125,000. Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total number of cars 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, he noticed that 1/2 of the cars had left. To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is the same as dividing 70 by 2. So, 70 / 2 = 35 cars had left.

Now, to find the number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars. This gives us 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were present when he got out of class for the lunch break, which is 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"Hello there. Let's break down John's weekly earnings. He does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle consists of 5 different tasks. Each task pays $1.20.

First, we need to find out how much John makes in a day. To do this, we multiply the number of cycles he does in a day by the number of tasks in each cycle and the pay per task.

Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Since John works a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7 to find his weekly earnings.

Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"Let's break down the information given about Sasha and Julie's basketball games. 

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. We know that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. So, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.

Now, let's consider the second game. Sasha struggles during away games, and this one was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her points from each game: 14 + 4 = 18.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and 6 packages of dog food. Each package of cat food contains 11 tins, and each package of dog food contains 6 tins.

To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

"Let's solve the problem together. We know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's count the number of eggs Cindy had altogether. 

First, we know Cindy had 5 green eggs. Then, she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, which is 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs. Next, she had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so that's 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, which is 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
- Cost per pound: $0.35
- Weight of the book: 4 pounds
- Cost per mile: $0.08
- Distance: 20 miles
- Total cost of shipping: (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20) = 1.4 + 1.6 = $2.99

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price:
- Purchase price: $32
- Refund amount: 0.75 * 32 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
- Total cost of shipping: $2.99
- Refund amount: $24
- Total loss: 2.99 + (32 - 24) = 2.99 + 8 = $10.99

"Let's break down Boris's chocolate production for the first three weeks. 

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate. 
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production. The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's break down the time Britany spends on TikTok-related activities per week:

- She spends 2 hours writing amateur songs, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes on makeup, 6 days a week, which is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.
- She records 18 videos, each 4 minutes long, which is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time she spends on these activities: 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: 18.8"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of the interior design installation for Angela.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors, cost: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier, cost: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures, cost: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Total cost of additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Total cost: $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

"I'm Isabelle, and I'm here to help you with your question. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, which means Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we need to divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take a total of 18 hours to cross the highway. To find out how long it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway, we need to divide the total time by the number of kangaroos. 

So, 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo.

Now, we're told that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means they will take twice as long to travel across the highway. 

Since there are four turtles, we need to multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2 and then by 4. 

First, we multiply by 2 to account for the turtles' slower speed: 6 hours * 2 = 12 hours per turtle. 

Then, we multiply by 4 to account for the number of turtles: 12 hours * 4 = 48 hours.

"Let's break down Erika's situation. She wants a new laptop that costs $600, but if she trades in her old one, the price will be reduced by $200. So, the new price of the laptop will be $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom is giving her $80 to help. So, she has a total of $150 + $80 = $230.

Since Erika only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs: $400 + $50 = $450.

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to subtract the amount she received from the total amount she has: $450 - $230 = $220.

"Let's break down Gabriel's situation. He wants to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800. To find out how much money he still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is $10,000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10,800.

Gabriel has $5,000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help him. So, he has a total of $5,000 + $200 = $5,200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items:
$10,800 - $5,200 = $4,600

So, Gabriel still needs $4,600."
"To find the change, we need to subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount Thea gave the craftsman. 

First, let's calculate the total amount Thea gave the craftsman: 4 * $20 = $80

Now, let's subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount: $80 - $70 = $10

Thea got $10 as change."
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Craig's shopping spree. Let's break it down step by step.

Craig starts with 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is a total of 2 x $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

To find the total amount he spent, we add the cost of squirt guns and water balloons: $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

So, Craig has $19 left after his shopping trip."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack collected by dividing the number of dishes by 2. Jack collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes together is 180."
"Let's break down the information given: there are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. We know that 5 of them are good at math only, and 8 of them perform well in English only. To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider those who are good at both subjects as well.

Since the students who are good at both math and English are counted in both the math only and English only groups, we need to add them to the students good at math only to get the total number of students good at math. To find the number of students good at both subjects, we subtract the sum of students good at math only and English only from the total number of students.

Students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, we add the students good at both math and English to the students good at math only to get the total number of students good at math.
Total students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Hi there, I'm Isabelle. I'd be happy to help you with Vicki's pop concert planning.

To figure out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time for each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes to perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

After 1 year, Brenda will have: $300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525
After 2 years, Brenda will have: $525 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $750
After 3 years, Brenda will have: $750 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $975

The final answer is: $975"
"Let's break down the information given. We have 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, which means 20 of them do. To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts: 40 - 20 = 20.

Now, let's look at the floral shirts. We know that 20 of them have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.

The question asks for the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. We already know that there are 20 white shirts with no collars and 30 floral shirts with no buttons. The difference between these two numbers is 30 - 20 = 10.

"Hello there. Let's calculate how much the farmer will earn from selling the eggs.

First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.

Number of trays = 900 / 30
= 30

Now, we know the farmer has 30 trays. To find out how much he will earn, we need to multiply the number of trays by the price per tray, which is $2.5.

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many goats were sold from Farm Y. Since Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, and he sold 10 goats from Farm X, we can calculate the number of goats sold from Farm Y by multiplying the number of goats sold from Farm X by 2. 
Number of goats sold from Farm Y = 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we know that Mr. Smith sold 20 goats from Farm Y. To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm Y.
Number of goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of goats left in Farm X. We know that Mr. Smith initially had 55 goats in Farm X and he sold 10 goats. To find the number of goats left in Farm X, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm X.
Number of goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45

Finally, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y.
Total number of goats left = 45 + 25 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

First, let's find the number of pairs of shoes James buys per year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, let's divide the total amount spent on shoes per year ($2640) by the number of pairs bought per year (24):

$2640 / 24 = $110

The final answer is: $110"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two types of baskets: green food baskets that cost $25 each and red food baskets that cost $18 each. We're buying 3 baskets of each type.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 green food baskets: 3 * $25 = $75. Then, we calculate the cost of 3 red food baskets: 3 * $18 = $54.

Now, we add the costs of both types of baskets together: $75 + $54 = $129. However, we also get a discount of $2 for each red food basket. Since we bought 3 red food baskets, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

To find the final cost, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $129 - $6 = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find out how long it takes to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to determine the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms in total, we'll calculate one-half of that.

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Now, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. To find the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have the following information:

- I am three years younger than my brother, so my age is x and my brother's age is x + 3.
- I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.
- My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

"Let's calculate how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy for his class.

First, we need to find out the total number of glue sticks required. There are 27 students in the class, and each student needs 2 glue sticks. 

Total number of students: 27
Number of glue sticks per student: 2
Total number of glue sticks required: 27 * 2 = 54

Now, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons, so we add that to the amount from the second day: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to add the amounts from all three days: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips.

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80.

Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

The total amount of money they received as tips is $800 + $720 = $1520.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jennifer bought 12 oranges from the market. She then gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, which is a total of 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. 

Next, she gave her only boy 3 oranges. To find the total number of oranges given to her children, we add the oranges given to her daughters and her son: 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, to find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month. Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves every hour, and she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. So, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked a total of 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, we need to convert the total number of slices to dollars. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so we can divide the total number of slices by 100 to get the total amount in dollars.

80 slices / 100 = 0.8 dollars per slice

Now, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised:

0.8 * 80 = 64 dollars

The final answer is: $64"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can find the number of silver coins by subtracting 30 from the number of gold coins.

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
Number of silver coins = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins.

Total coins = Number of silver coins + Number of gold coins
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George.

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

The total number of burritos eaten is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos in total, the number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the information given about the bumper car rink. We know they have 12 red cars. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so the rink has 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

Next, we're told the rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. Since there are 10 green cars, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, let's add up the number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has a total of 75 cars, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the overall total: 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We can express the relationship between Sofie and Anne's books as S = A + 25. We can also express the relationship between Anne and Fawn's books as A = F - 12.

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25. This simplifies to S = F + 13.

We also know that the total number of books is the sum of the books each person has, so S + A + F = 85. Substituting the first equation into this equation, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85.

Combining like terms, we get 2F + A + 13 = 85. Now, let's substitute the second equation into this equation to get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85.

Combining like terms, we get 3F + 1 = 85. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get 3F = 84. Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we get F = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To determine how much Greg will spend on Jello, we first need to figure out how many boxes of Jello he needs. Since there will be 30 kids at the party and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, the total number of Jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since one box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, the number of boxes needed is 120 / 10 = 12.

The cost of one box of Jello is $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far.

First, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To do this, we multiply 2/5 by 60. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

Next, we know he ate 10 pieces on the second day.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find this out, we multiply 7/13 by 26. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day: 
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to first determine the cost of 1 bottle of soda and 1 bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"Let's calculate how much money David has left after buying the bolts.

To do this, we need to find the total cost of the bolts. Since each bolt costs $0.03 and David wants to buy 16 bolts, we multiply the number of bolts by the cost per bolt:

16 bolts * $0.03 per bolt = $0.48

Now, we subtract the cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, David has $12.00 left after buying the bolts."

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 questions, and Amy correctly answers 80% of them. So, she gets 10 * 0.8 = 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. There are 20 questions, and Amy correctly answers 90% of them. So, she gets 20 * 0.9 = 18 points from the true/false questions.

Now, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. There are 5 questions, and Amy correctly answers 60% of them. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, she gets 5 * 0.6 * 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

To find Amy's total score, we add the points from each type of question together: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41.

"To make a profit of $2000, I need to sell the chickens I'm taking to the market from my farm at $50 per chicken. I have 300 chickens on my farm and plan to sell 3/5 of them. 

First, I need to find out how many chickens I plan to sell. Since I'm selling 3/5 of the 300 chickens, I can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since I plan to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money I will make from selling the chickens is:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, I need to make a profit of $2000, so the total amount I need to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since I will make $9000 from selling the chickens, the amount I need to make from selling the chickens to make a profit of $2000 is $9000. 

But I'm actually looking for the cost price of the chickens. To find the cost price, I need to subtract the profit from the selling price. 

The selling price is $9000 and the profit is $2000. 

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

The cost price of the chickens is $7000.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses of lemonade. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold together by subtracting the number of glasses Julie sold from the total.

Total glasses sold = 32
Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold - Glasses sold by Julie = 32 - 14 = 18

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses each of them sold by dividing the total number of glasses they sold by 2.

Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 18
Number of people selling glasses = 2
Glasses sold by Micah = Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

Now, we can find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 9
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 9 = 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, we can find the cost of one pack of bacon by dividing the total cost by the number of packs: $10 / 5 = $2. Then, we multiply this by 2 to find the cost of one packet of chicken: $2 * 2 = $4. Now, we multiply the cost of one packet of chicken by the number of packets Kelly has: 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, we need to find the cost of the apples. Since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, and the strawberries cost $4 each, we can find the cost of one pack of apples by dividing the cost of a strawberry by 2: $4 / 2 = $2. Now, we multiply the cost of one pack of apples by the number of packs Kelly has: 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we can find the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart by adding up the cost of the bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples: $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it includes a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as x minutes. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x minutes. Adding the 15-minute encore, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 minutes.

We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"

To find the number of microphones that will be arranged in pairs, we can calculate 80% of 50. 

80% of 50 = 0.8 * 50 = 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the total number of microphones arranged in pairs by 2.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

Total cookies = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 55 - 5 = 50

Now, we know Lani placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to divide the cookies left by the number of jars.

Cookies per jar = Cookies left / Number of jars = 50 / 5 = 10

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"Let's break down Ellen's daily expenses. She eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which means it costs $3.

To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to determine the total cost of the carrots. Let's represent the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Since Ellen eats two carrots, the total cost of the carrots is 2x.

The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11, which is the sum of the cost of 2 carrots, the salad, and the yogurt. We can write this as an equation: 2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x (for Joe's lawn) + 18x (for Kamala's lawn) + 30x (for Alba's lawn) = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

To find y, we need to find the value of x. Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y. 
54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

"Let's calculate John's profit from renting his car. He rents it out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour. His car payment is $500.

First, we need to find the total amount he earns from renting his car. To do this, we multiply the number of times he rents it by the number of hours and his hourly rate.

Number of times rented: 10
Number of hours per rental: 3
Hourly rate: $25

Total earnings = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, we need to subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Martha initially had some notebooks, and then she bought 5 more, resulting in a total of 7 notebooks. To find out how many notebooks Martha had initially, we subtract the number of notebooks she bought from the total number of notebooks she now has: 7 - 5 = 2.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha had 2 notebooks initially, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: 1"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first find the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

"Let's figure out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get. 

First, we need to find out how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took some. Susan started with 100 cookies and her husband took 4, so there are 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's break down the information given. Denise read 10 pages yesterday, and Daniel read 13 pages yesterday. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, we only need to consider his reading from yesterday.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, and Denise read 5 more than that, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. 

To find the total number of pages each of them read, we add the pages from yesterday and today. Denise's total pages read = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.
Daniel's total pages read = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel. The difference is 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Calvin's pot can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since there are 4 adults (Calvin, his wife, and 2 children) and each adult eats one bowl, 4 adult bowls will be used for dinner. 

Since 4 adult bowls are equal to 4 child bowls, 4 child bowls will also be used for dinner. This leaves 4 child bowls of soup leftover.

Now, we need to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. There are 2 children, and each child will eat one bowl for lunch. To find the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we divide the total number of leftover child bowls by the number of children: 4 / 2 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Jo's face mask material needs. To figure out how much material she needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, we know that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks. So, the material needed per small mask is 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per mask. To make 20 small masks, Jo will need 20 * 0.5 yards = 10 yards of material.

For large masks, we know that 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks. So, the material needed per large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per mask. To make 8 large masks, Jo will need 8 * 0.75 yards = 6 yards of material.

Now, let's add the material needed for small and large masks together. Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many red shoeboxes Tim used. To do this, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9.

1/3 of 9 = 9 / 3 = 3

So, Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes to go fishing.

Now, let's find out how many shoeboxes are left. Initially, Tim had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. After using 3 blue and 3 red shoeboxes, he is left with:

Blue shoeboxes: 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoeboxes: 9 - 3 = 6

Therefore, the total number of shoeboxes left is 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10.

"To find out how many books Joseph has, we first need to determine how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, we multiply 9 by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

So, Joseph initially had 18 books. However, he lost 2 of them. To find out how many books he currently has, we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books.

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives 1/5 of them to Jamie. To find out how many marbles that is, we need to divide 30 by 5. 

30 / 5 = 6

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Next, he gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Dean has left. To do that, we need to subtract the marbles he gave away from the total. 

First, let's add up the marbles he gave away: 6 (to Jamie) + 10 (to Donald) = 16

Now, let's subtract the marbles he gave away from the total: 30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: (Duncan's age eight years ago) = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)
So, (60 - 8) = 2x
52 = 2x
x = 26

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam's age four years ago was 26, his current age is 26 + 4 = 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. To find the total acres of Farmer Smith's farm, we need to calculate twice the acres of Farmer Brown's farm and add 100 to it. 

Twice the acres of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we need to add the acres of both farms together. 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

"Let's break down Colby's earnings for a typical eight-hour workday. 

First, we need to find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so that's 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. 40 packages per hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day are 320 * $0.20 = $64.

"Hello there. To determine how many bottles of water John drinks while solving a sudoku puzzle, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by 30 minutes, as he drinks a bottle every half hour.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so it takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's calculate how many bottles of water John drinks in that time. We'll divide the total time by 30 minutes.

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We know that he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna and that 20 of the balloons were red.

First, let's calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since there are 20 red balloons and Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. The total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3 * y.

We know that the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58. So, we can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

To solve for y, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 18.

Then, we divide both sides by 3: y = 6.

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, we can multiply this by the number of days to find the total miles driven.

Total miles driven = 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we need to divide the total miles driven by the interval at which Jon's car needs a tune-up, which is every 1000 miles.

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven / 1000 = 3000 / 1000 = 3

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream for their father's birthday. 

The cake costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since the balloons are sold in sets of 2 for $0.5, we need to find out how many sets of 2 balloons they bought. To do this, we divide 12 by 2, which equals 6. Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set: 6 * $0.5 = $3. 

Next, they bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. The total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items they bought: $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

"Hi there, I'm Isabelle. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many pets Larry has.

To start, Larry has 3 cats. He also has 3 times as many dogs as cats, which means he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Now, let's talk about his fish tank. He has three times the number of fish as rabbits, which means he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Moving on to his gerbils, Larry has a collection that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old, and by her 10th birthday, she has been collecting for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months to get the total number of months.

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows. To find out how many cups are in each row, we need to divide 27 by 3.

27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 / 2.

However, we can't have half a cup of tea, so we need to consider the whole number options. If there are 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. 

If there are 5 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15.

Since the total number of mint tea cups is 15, the correct answer is 5.

"Let's break down Colby's expenses for the month. He has a budget of $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

"Hello there. Let's calculate the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked. 

First, we need to find the calories of each type of mini pastry. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, we'll calculate the calories from the blueberry muffins. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories. 

Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J. 

We can start by using the information that Paul is 10 years older than Jean. This can be expressed as Pp = J + 10.

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, which can be expressed as P = Pp + J.

Now, we can use the fact that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. This can be expressed as P + Pp + J = 100.

We can substitute Pp with J + 10 in the equation P + Pp + J = 100:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P with Pp + J in the equation P + 2J + 10 = 100:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Since Pp = J + 10, we can substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

"Let's calculate the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney in their watermelon seed spitting contest.

Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, her total distance is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, her total distance is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we need to divide the total distance by the total number of seeds spat. The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

Average total distance spat = Total distance spat / Total seeds spat = 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000.

First, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. To do this, we'll multiply the number of widgets each machine can make per hour by the number of hours it runs in a day and then by the number of days in the month.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day. In a 30-day month, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour and also runs 24 hours a day. In a 30-day month, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now that we know how many widgets each machine can produce, we can calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6, so we'll multiply the number of widgets by the price per widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 will make:
43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The WidgetMaster 9000 will make:
32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we'll subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue of the Widgeteer 3000:
$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay, and 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. However, Cameron decides to add 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours.

For the first 12 hours, Cameron would have to pay 1000 pesos. Since he stays for 17 hours, he needs to add 70 * 5 = 350 pesos for the additional 5 hours.

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay would be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to compare this to the cost of the 24-hour option. The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat requires 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs by finding twice the amount each goat needs and then subtracting 3 pounds.

Twice the amount each goat needs is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"Let's break down John's situation. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked for 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars. After spending 50 dollars on gas, he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

John also wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, which means he'll have 250 - 100 = 150 dollars remaining.

Now, let's consider the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars, and John wants to buy 5 of them. The total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. After buying the pencils, John will have 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

With the remaining 100 dollars, John can buy pens that cost 25 dollars each. To find out how many pens he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of each pen: 100 / 25 = 4.

So, John can buy 4 pens with the money he has left."
"Let's break down the problem. Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. To find the total number of letters in the words he spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters Craig spelled to the total number of letters his brother spelled: 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: 650"
"Hello there. To find the total number of children participating in the drill, we need to consider the number of children in each row, the number of rows, and the number of schools.

There are 8 children in each row, 7 rows in total, and 5 different schools. To find the total number of children, we multiply these numbers together.

Total number of children = 8 * 7 * 5
Total number of children = 280

The final answer is: 280"
"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles she gives to the students. 

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she gets is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, to find out how many bottles she has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she got. 

900 - 58 = 842

The final answer is: 842"
"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the visit fee.

First, let's calculate the labor cost. Since Patty charges $35 per hour, or part thereof, for labor, we multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly rate. In this case, Patty worked 2.25 hours, so the labor cost is 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75.

Next, we need to add the cost of parts, which is $60, and the visit fee, which is $40.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"Let's break down James' situation. He bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so the original price is 10 * $15 = $150. However, he got them for 40% off, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60. After the discount, he paid $150 - $60 = $90.

James then sold 5 CDs for $40 each, making a total of 5 * $40 = $200. To find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the amount he spent. So, he was out $90 - $200 = -$110. The negative sign indicates a loss.

The final answer is: -$110"
"Let's calculate the total earnings from Jen's root crops. 

First, we need to find out how much she earns from the yams. Since she has 6 yams and each yam can be sold at $1.5, the total earnings from yams are 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we'll calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes. Jen has 10 sweet potatoes, and each one costs $2. So, the total earnings from sweet potatoes are 10 * $2 = $20.

Lastly, we'll determine the earnings from the carrots. Jen has 4 carrots, and each carrot costs $1.25. Therefore, the total earnings from carrots are 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"Let's break down James' journey across the lake. First, we need to find the time it took him to swim 60% of the 20-mile lake. To do this, we'll calculate 60% of 20 miles.

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. To find out how many loaves the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had and then subtract 40 from that result.

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Now, we need to subtract 40 from 490 to find the number of loaves the bakery has: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Jasmine's sticker problem. 

Let's break it down step by step. Jasmine was given 15 stickers for participating in class. Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. To find out how many stickers she has left, we need to subtract the stickers she lost from the stickers she was given initially.

15 (initial stickers) - 7 (lost stickers) = 8

After losing 7 stickers, Jasmine has 8 stickers left. But that's not the end of the story. Her teacher gave her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates. To find out how many stickers she has now, we need to add the stickers she received for helping her classmates to the stickers she already had.

8 (remaining stickers) + 5 (new stickers) = 13

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

13"
"To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

Commission from New York Times: 
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
- Commission = 300 / 100
- Commission = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal: 
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
- Commission = 1200 / 100
- Commission = $12

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3 + $12
- Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given: Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can find his age by subtracting 5 from Deanna's age. 

Deanna's age: 26
Marcus's age: 26 - 5 = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. To find Leo's age, we need to multiply Marcus's age by 2.

Marcus's age: 21
Leo's age: 21 * 2 = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored.

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We can simplify this to A - D = -10. 

Now, we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get B = (D - 10) + 20. 

This simplifies to B = D + 10. 

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (D + 10) + (D - 10) + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = 15 - 10. 

This simplifies to A = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider that each paper is printed on both sides, meaning each inch of paper contains 200 pages (100 pages per inch * 2 sides).

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches.

The total number of pages in the book is 200 * 1.5 = 300 pages.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. Vince stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:
15 * 60 = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 / 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 * 60 = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

The final answer is: 457"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can find the number of spoons by multiplying the number of cups by 2/3. 

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 spoons.

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of cups and the number of spoons.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to determine the initial number of occupied beds. Since 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we can calculate this as follows:

1/5 of 1000 = 200

This means that 200 beds are occupied initially. 

Now, let's calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to multiply 50 by 14 (the number of days in 2 weeks).

50 * 14 = 700

Now, we add the number of occupied beds initially to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

200 + 700 = 900

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

1000 - 900 = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down Robyn's emails. She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work-related. To find out how many non-work emails she sends, we subtract the work emails from the total: 16 - 7 = 9.

Now, we know that two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family. To find two-thirds of 9, we multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3: (2 * 9) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. So, 6 emails are to her family.

The remaining non-work emails (not to family) are 9 - 6 = 3. Now, we need to find out how many of these emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1 * 3) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

From point 3, we know Aliya's age is 3 years. 
From point 2, we know Shawna's age is three times Aliya's age, so Shawna's age is 3 * 3 = 9 years.

From point 1, we know Shawna's father's age is five times Shawna's age, so Shawna's father's age is 5 * 9 = 45 years.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Courtney reported the audience to be 48 people, but Kelly said that Courtney made a mistake and overstated the number by 20%. To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of 48 and subtract it from 48.

20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6. Now, let's subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, let's find the total number of balls carried by the three boys. We add the number of balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls carried by the boys, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is also 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day. On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. Amora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally, but it turned out that only two people would get an equal amount, while the other person would receive 15 more corn chips than the number the others got. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each.

Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add the number of corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got. We can do this by adding 70 + 70 + 85.

70 + 70 = 140
140 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Hello there, trainer! I'm Isabelle, the friendly Pokémon Center nurse. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many Pokémon Stan has caught.

Let's start by using some math to solve the problem. We know that together, Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught 339 Pokémon. We can represent the number of Pokémon caught by each of them as variables: A for Adelwolfe, S for Stan, and L for Alex.

We know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so we can write an equation: L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 fewer Pokémon than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write another equation: S = 4A - 13.

Now, let's use these equations to find out how many Pokémon Stan has caught. We can start by adding the first equation to the second one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.

This simplifies to: A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Next, we can substitute the second equation into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

This simplifies to: A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan has caught: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's break down the information given: John is watching a new show where each episode is 20 minutes long. It's also mentioned that there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode.

Since there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, the number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

The bird first flies in a southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. This means she covers a distance of 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Next, the bird turns direction and flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. This results in a distance of 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Finally, the bird changes direction and flies toward the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, covering a distance of 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Since the bird traveled 36 miles north, we need to subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to find the net distance between the two homes.

Net distance = Distance traveled in the first 10 hours + Distance traveled in the last 5 hours - Distance traveled in the 2 hours
Net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"

Then, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. And, to make her birthday even more special, her friends surprised her with 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we add these amounts together: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

However, not all of these brownies made it to the end of the day. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were devoured, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

"Let's break down the information given. Nani is 8 years old, and his brother is twice his age. So, his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

To find Nani's sister's age, we need to determine what 25% of Nani's age is. Since 25% is the same as 0.25, we multiply Nani's age by 0.25. This gives us 8 * 0.25 = 2 years. However, this is the amount younger Nani's sister is compared to him. To find her actual age, we subtract this amount from Nani's age: 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. To find the total number of wooden slats needed for Robert's garden fence, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges at the market. Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She then gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, let's find out how many oranges she has left. We subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges: 240 - 80 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Now, we need to find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn $25. Since he earns $5 per hour, we can find the number of hours by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. To find out how many cherries Richard has, we need to subtract 10 from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Richard and Robert have 20 + 30 = 50 cherries together, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's total from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the information given for Sunny's fundraiser.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. This means he sold 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which is 15 boxes. He also sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need for her vacation, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use.

She reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce. So, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Since each bottle of sunscreen is 8 ounces, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces) to find out how many bottles she will need.

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the price of the blue car is $100, and the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of $100. To do this, we multiply $100 by 0.4 (since 40% is the same as 0.4). This gives us $40.

Now, we subtract the discount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car: $100 - $40 = $60.

So, the price of the red car is $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the prices of the blue and red cars together: $100 + $60 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the information given:

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. 

From the information, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil will be 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

From this, we can also deduce that when Emil turns 24, his dad will be twice as old as Emil. So, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Now, we need to find the current age of Emil's dad and brother. Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old (since Emil is 19 now and will turn 24 in 5 years). Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the information given. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend. So, 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down Joe's crawfish catch. On Thursday, he caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this by multiplying 0.2 by the total number of students, which is 30.

0.2 * 30 = 6 students are football players.

Now, we need to find the number of cheerleaders or band members. Since these students are part of the remaining class after removing the football players, we subtract the number of football players from the total number of students.

30 - 6 = 24 students are remaining.

Next, we need to find 25% of the remaining 24 students to determine the number of cheerleaders or band members.

0.25 * 24 = 6 students are cheerleaders or band members.

To find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to add their shoe sizes and divide by 2.

Sophie's shoe size is 5. 
Charlie's shoe size is 5 times Sophie's, so it is 5 * 5 = 25.

The sum of their shoe sizes is 5 + 25 = 30.
The average shoe size is 30 / 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the width of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract 18 inches from the total length of the flower bed for each plant. However, we also need to subtract the width of the plant itself (12 inches) from the remaining length. 

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 18n - 12n = 1320 - 30n.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of 18. 

1/2 of 18 = 18 / 2 = 9

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 * 7 = 63

The final answer is: 63"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Katherine's hanging basket dilemma. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias. Katherine has 5 baskets and wants to add 3 petunias to each one. So, the total number of petunias is 5 * 3 = 15. Since each petunia costs $3.00, the total cost of petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines. Katherine has 5 baskets and wants to add 2 vines to each one. So, the total number of vines is 5 * 2 = 10. Since each vine costs $2.50, the total cost of vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and vines together to find the total cost. $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"Let's calculate how many roses Artemis and her father can plant with the 30-pound bag of soil. 

First, we need to find out how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations. They are planting 4 sunflowers, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. So, the total soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, they are planting 10 carnations, and each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. So, the total soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

They have 30 pounds of soil in total, so the amount of soil left for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Let's break down Jessica's situation. She makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. To find out how much she saves each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she saves $500.00 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year to find the total savings in a year: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we need to divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. To find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both tasks simultaneously.

First, let's calculate how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Next, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the second time, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet and then use that information to determine Bill's age at the time of the second sighting.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 

Three times the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is 3 * 30 = 90 years old. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. 

So, Bill's dad was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when Bill was born. 

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, Bill was 30 - 15 = 15 years old when his dad was born.

Now, let's find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. We know that the time between Bill's dad seeing the comet and Bill seeing it for the second time is 75 years. 

Since Bill was 15 years old when his dad was born, and his dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 15 + 30 = 45 years old when his dad saw the comet.

Therefore, Bill was 45 - 75 = -30 years old when he saw the comet for the first time. However, since age cannot be negative, this is not a valid answer.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the time between Bill's dad seeing the comet and Bill seeing it for the second time is 75 years. 

Since Bill was 15 years old when his dad was born, and his dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 15 + 30 = 45 years old when his dad saw the comet.

However, we also know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 90 years old.

Since Bill was 15 years old when his dad was born, and his dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 15 + 30 = 45 years old when his dad saw the comet.

However, we also know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 90 years old. 

So, the time between Bill's dad seeing the comet and Bill seeing it for the second time is 90 - 30 = 60 years, not 75 years. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. We know that the time between Bill's dad seeing the comet and Bill seeing it for the second time is 75 years.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and add them together.

First, let's consider the regular monthly bills. Buford writes a check for the electric bill once a month, so that's 12 checks per year. He also writes a check for the gas bill once a month, which adds another 12 checks per year.

Next, we have the checks to the church. Buford writes two checks to the church every month, so that's 24 checks per year.

Lastly, we have the quarterly checks to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, Buford writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that the first plane makes a total of x flights per day. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the total number of flights made by the first plane by doubling the number of flights made by the second plane. So, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. To find the number of flights to Greece, we multiply the total number of flights made by the first plane by three-quarters: (3/4) * 88 = 66.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we subtract the number of flights to Greece from the total number of flights made by the first plane and then divide the result by 2: (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's calculate the combined length of time the three wolves' howls. 

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam bought some new trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6 to help with the purchase. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12.

To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents. This is $6 (from his mother) + $12 (from his father) = $18.

Now, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (total from parents) = $12.

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings to buy the trousers.

The final answer is: $12"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We have four children: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.

Let's start by finding the total age of Akbar and Alessandro. 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age = 3 + 4 = 7

Since the total age of the children is 20, we can express the total age as:
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20

We also know that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4)

We can simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
7 + (7 + W) + W = 20
14 + 2W = 20
2W = 6
W = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Walter starts by collecting $500 from his neighbors. Then, he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. 

The total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

However, Walter's lawyer will only consider the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, not the $200 donated by his friend. Therefore, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 is still $2000.

To find out how much the lawyer will contribute, we multiply $2000 by 3.

$2000 * 3 = $6000

The final answer is: $6000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

Next, the bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a family of 6, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids. They want to divide a watermelon in such a way that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

To simplify the problem, let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. If each kid gets x units, then each adult gets 2x units, since they get twice as much as each kid.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each). The total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combine like terms: 6x = 100.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

So, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 33.33"
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes
Convert total time from minutes to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Jordan needs 3 hours to make the cake. To be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm, she should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

"Let's break down the problem. Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars door to door. Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, and Peter sold four and a half boxes. They sold 64 chocolate bars together.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total earnings per month are $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Peter and Martha have the same number of chocolate bars in each box, but the total number of chocolate bars they have is different.

To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the number of female porcupines in the park. Since the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Now, let's determine the total number of babies born in a year. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, and there are 12 months in a year. So, the total number of babies born in a year is:

Total babies born in a year = 4 * 12 = 48

To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we add the initial population to the number of babies born:

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

"Let's count the sticks. We have 9 red sticks. There are 5 more blue sticks than red, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 
9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles
Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.
Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, let's break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old, which means there are 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16. Since one-fourth of these students are male, we can find the number of male students over 16 by dividing 1500 by 4, which equals 375. Therefore, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Next, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which also equals 1500 students. Since one-half of these students are male, we can find the number of male students under 16 by dividing 1500 by 2, which equals 750. Therefore, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16, which equals 1125 + 750 = 1875.

"Let's break down the information given about the number of laps each person can run in an hour.

Bethany can run 10 laps in an hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps. 

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, which means she can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps. 

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, let's find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. Therefore, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Maria's power bank was losing 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours. After that, it started losing 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. We're given that the final charge remaining is 28%.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

For the next 3 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%. However, we know that the final charge remaining is 28%, so the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

Now, let's find the charge remaining after 8 hours. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 6%, so the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34% - 6% = 28%. This means that the charge remaining after 8 hours is indeed 28%.

To find the initial charge, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the first 5 hours. The charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%, so the charge lost in the first 5 hours is 100% - 55% = 45%.

Now, we can set up the equation: x - 45% = 55% (charge remaining after 5 hours).

Solving for x, we get x = 100%.

However, this is not possible since the power bank wasn't fully charged when Maria went to the park. Let's re-evaluate the equation: x - 45% = 55% (charge remaining after 5 hours).

We can rewrite the equation as x = 55% + 45% = 100% + 45% = 145%. However, this is also not possible since the power bank's capacity cannot be more than 100%.

Let's re-evaluate the equation again: x - 45% = 55% (charge remaining after 5 hours).

We can rewrite the equation as x = 55% + 45% = 100% + 45% = 145% is incorrect, so we need to re-evaluate the equation x - 45% = 55% (charge remaining after 5 hours).

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Janet's question. 

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. 20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000) to find out how many weeks she needs to work. 

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruits. He's already bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, 4 pears at $0.5 each, 2 kiwis at $1 each, and 5 apples at $0.75 each.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Now, let's see how many plums he can buy with the remaining money. Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, each friend received 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are in 1.3 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, 1 pack has 60 pieces. 

1.3 packs = 1 pack + 0.3 packs. 
1 pack has 60 pieces, so 0.3 packs have 0.3 * 60 = 18 pieces.

So, each friend received 60 + 18 = 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you calculate the price of carrots after three years in Mrs. Tatiana's grocery store.

To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"Let's break down the information given. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. 

Since she put the same number of pictures into each album, we can find the number of pictures in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, let's consider the types of albums. 3 albums were selfies only, and 2 albums were portraits. The remaining albums are not specified, but we can find the number of albums that are neither selfies nor portraits by subtracting the number of selfies and portrait albums from the total number of albums.

8 albums - 3 selfies albums - 2 portrait albums = 3 albums

However, we are not given any information about the remaining albums, so we can't determine the type of pictures in those albums. But we can find the number of selfies and portraits. 

The number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The number of portraits is 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits.

However, we can also consider the possibility that the remaining 3 albums could be portraits. In this case, the number of portraits would be 5 albums * 9 pictures per album = 45 portraits.

To determine the correct answer, we need to consider both possibilities.

Option 1: 27 selfies and 45 portraits
Option 2: 18 selfies and 54 portraits

Since we don't have enough information to determine the correct answer, we can't provide a single numerical answer. However, if we must choose one of the options, we can consider the fact that the question asks for the number of portraits and selfies. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

James reads 18 pages in total. Since he reads 3 pages per set, we divide 18 by 3 to find the number of sets: 18 / 3 = 6 sets.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we multiply the number of sets by the time per set: 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.

"Let's break down the situation at the hotel. Initially, there were 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so we subtract those as well: 76 - 15 = 61 guests.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. We add these new guests to the remaining count: 61 + 30 = 91 guests.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, bringing the total to 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The final answer is: 98"

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then find out how many of each she is sure to get.

First, let's find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are in the quiz:
- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36
- Average questions: 36 / 2 = 18
- Difficult questions: 36 / 2 = 18

Now, let's find out how many of each type of question Aries is sure to get:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9

Now, let's add up the number of questions Aries is sure to get:
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Since x = 2y, we can substitute this into the equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The family eats 5 sandwiches per day by the man, 4 sandwiches per day by the wife, and 2 sandwiches per day by their son. 

So, the total number of sandwiches they eat per day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.

In one week, they eat 11 * 7 = 77 sandwiches.

"Let's break down Suzanne's earnings. She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, which gives her a total of 80 * $1 = $80. 

Next, she sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, which gives her a total of 60 * $4 = $240.

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne also gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's solve the problem together. We know that the Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 60 eggs. There are 10 eggs that were not found by anyone.

To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we need to subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

"Hello there, I'm Isabelle. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to first determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

Now, let's calculate how much ore he can mine with a steel pickaxe. A steel pickaxe allows him to mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now that we know one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, we can find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day by multiplying 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2 and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2. 

Since the ratios are the same, the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches will be proportional to the price of the second package. 

The price of the second package is $6 for 4 sandwiches. To find the price per sandwich, we divide the price by the number of sandwiches: 6/4 = 1.5. 

Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: 1.5 * 8 = 12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month for the bedroom set, we need to calculate the remaining balance after he sells his old bedroom set and then determine the monthly interest.

First, let's find out how much Tom still owes after selling his old bedroom set:

Total cost of bedroom set: $3000
Amount paid from selling old bedroom set: $1000
Amount still owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to find out how much Tom has to pay per month. The interest rate is 10% per month, so we need to calculate 10% of the amount still owed:

Amount still owed: $2000
Interest rate: 10% = 0.10
Monthly payment: $2000 * 0.10 = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"Let's break down the situation step by step. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst due to the strong gust of wind. To find the number of red balloons that burst, we multiply 25 by 0.4, which equals 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 15 red balloons.

Next, the loud sound startled Sally, causing her to release half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 6 yellow balloons.

As Sally approached the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree. She added 75% of these blue balloons to her remaining clutch. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.75, which equals 6. So, Sally added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons Sally has: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. The total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to subtract the number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question asks for the number of tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, implying that the remaining tickets are for guests.

Therefore, the answer is 5 tickets per graduate."
"Let's figure out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat. We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we need to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can set up a proportion to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans.

Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Then, 3x = 150. To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

The final answer is: 50"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Melissa's jury pay situation. 

To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Total earnings: 3 days * $15 per day = $45
Total expenses: 3 days * $3 per day = $9

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Next, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total: 
Total hours = 6 hours per day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses:
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

"Let's break down Ted's purchases. He bought 3 books for $16 each, so the total cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars. He also bought 3 pencils for $6 each, so the total cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

The final answer is: $66"
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to determine the total number of soda bottles and then multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

"To find out how much money Amor will have left after buying cheese, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so after buying the cheese, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left.

"Let's break down Jim's situation. He took out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, which totals to $200,000 in loans. Additionally, he lost $25,000 per year for 4 years due to not working while in college, which amounts to $100,000.

The total amount Jim needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, Jim's income triples to $75,000 per year. To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width, so the area of one piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day.

First, we need to calculate the amount lost in each race. 

In the first race, he lost $5. 

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

The number of races is 3.

To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

"To find the total population of South America, we need to calculate the total number of people living in all the cities. 

There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities. Since the whole population lives in these cities, we can start by finding the total number of cities: 26 countries * 5 cities per country = 130 cities.

Now, we know that each city has 1000 people. To find the total population, we multiply the total number of cities by the population of each city: 130 cities * 1000 people per city = 130,000 people.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three people who divided an amount of $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first, and the third person took twice what the second took.

Let's denote the share of the first person as x. The second person's share would then be x + 80, and the third person's share would be 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combining like terms, we get: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Simplifying further, we get: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtracting 240 from both sides, we get: 4x = 1680.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 420.

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car is $20,000, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * depreciation rate)
= $12,472 - ($12,472 * 0.21)
= $12,472 - $2,620.32

First, the tank top costs $10. 
Next, the running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
Lastly, the athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

"Let's break down Greg's laundry needs. He puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 

For the twin beds, he needs 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets. 
For the king size bed, he needs 1 king sheet.

So, in total, he needs 8 + 1 = 9 sheets per week.

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, let's find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

To find out how many days the food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of food each cat eats per day and then divide the total amount of cat food by that amount.

Each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 grams per cat per day.

Now, let's multiply the amount each cat eats per day by the number of cats: 120 grams * 3 cats = 360 grams per day.

To find out how many days the food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount each cat eats per day (360 grams): 720 / 360 = 2.

So, the cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's break down the information given: Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas, and each pizza had 8 slices. This means there are a total of 8 * 4 = 32 slices.

We know Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes.

Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: 58"
"Let's break down the costs of Hannah's doctor's visit.

First, there's the cost of the cast, which is $200. 

Next, we have the cost of the doctor's visit. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit lasted for 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Hannah also needs to pay for painkillers. She needs 30 painkillers at $4 each, so the total cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Finally, there's the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6 per hour, and the minimum parking time is 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"Let's break down James' email situation. He receives 80 emails a day. Out of those, 20% don't require a response. To find out how many emails he doesn't respond to, we need to calculate 20% of 80.

20% of 80 is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, let's add up the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we need to calculate 70% of 20. 

70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and there are 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of coupon. The cost per small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents. The cost per big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. To find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered, we need to subtract 3 from 10. 

10 - 3 = 7

Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

7 * 4 = 28

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, there were 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left. Sidney ordered 3 more sub sandwiches. 

3 + 3 = 6

Now, there are 6 meatball sub sandwiches left. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

6 * 4 = 24

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Two hours after they departed, a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures and couldn't deliver the fertiliser.

First, we need to find the number of trucks that had mechanical failures. A quarter of 20 is 20 * (1/4) = 5 trucks.

Now, we know that 5 trucks couldn't deliver the fertiliser, so the number of trucks that reached the farmers is 20 - 5 = 15.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 * 20 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

Since Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he needs 6 pounds of butter. 

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, so for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays the full price of $4.00 for one pound and half off for the other pound. 

For 6 pounds of butter, he will need to buy 3 sets of 2 pounds. 

The cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter is:
- 3 sets * $4.00 (full price) = $12.00
- 3 sets * $2.00 (half off) = $6.00
- Total cost for 6 pounds of butter = $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total cost of Kayla's party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and multiply it by the cost per guest, then add the initial fee.

First, let's find the total number of guests attending the party. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and the 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members. However, 4 people said they could not come. So, the total number of guests attending is 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. The number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost per additional guest is $6. So, the cost for the additional guests is 21 * 6 = $126.

Now, we add the initial fee of $125 to the cost for the additional guests to get the total cost. The total cost is $126 + $125 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending some of their money, we can infer that they both had the same amount initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. To find out how much money she had initially, we can set up an equation: 3/4 * x = 60, where x is the initial amount of money Maggie had. Solving for x, we get x = 60 / (3/4) = 80.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. To find out how much money she had initially, we can set up an equation: 2/3 * x = 60, where x is the initial amount of money Riza had. Solving for x, we get x = 60 / (2/3) = 90.

However, we know that they both had the same amount initially, so we can use either value. Let's use Maggie's initial amount: $80.

Now, let's find out how much money Maggie has left. She spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * $80 = $20. So, she has $80 - $20 = $60 left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * $90 = $30. So, she has $90 - $30 = $60 left.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have: $60 + $60 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many bananas the monkeys eat each day by dividing 315 by 7.

315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, let's consider the eating habits of the monkeys. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten each day. 

45 (total bananas per day) - 10 (first monkey) - 14 (second monkey) = 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: 21"

The total number of pieces Teddy placed is 250 (from the first puzzle) + 500 (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Jenny's flower purchase. 

To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought them by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen. 

15 roses is 1 and 3 roses. 1 dozen is 12 roses, so she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses. 

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

"To find the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Melanie has been saving toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has saved so far, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of the original price, we multiply the original price by 0.75. The original price of the watch is $2000, so the price Mr. Rogers paid is:
2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Next, we need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. He sold it at 120% of the price he bought it, so we multiply the price he paid by 1.2:
1500 * 1.2 = $1800

Now, we need to find the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. This is the difference between the original price and the price he paid:
2000 - 1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
(200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how many jellyfish 5 springs create in 4 hours.

First, we need to convert 4 hours into seconds. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame.

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Now, we know that each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second. Since there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

To find the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

So, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72,000."

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many bananas Jenny bought in total. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, we multiply the number of bunches by the number of bananas per bunch: 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 bananas individually. The price per banana is $0.80, so we multiply the total number of bananas by the price per banana: 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, we need to find the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, we multiply the number of bunches by the price per bunch: 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence between them. They decide to split it, with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam. 

Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine its growth rate per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years.

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month.

First, we need to find the number of each type of bike sold. We know that Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, which is 300 / 2 = 150. 

Next, we need to find the number of BMX bikes sold. We know that 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so we multiply 300 by 0.15 to get 45.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105.

Now that we know the number of each type of bike sold, we can calculate the total earnings for each type of bike. The price of a Trekking bike is $450, so 150 * $450 = $67,500. The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500, so the price of a BMX bike is $250. Therefore, 45 * $250 = $11,250. The price of an MTB is $500, so 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"

First, let's calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer. Since the farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, the total number of bales made is 5 * 6 = 30.

Next, let's calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck. The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales picked up is 3 * 6 = 18.

Now, to find the number of bales left in the field, we need to subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and the extra time he dedicates on the weekends.

First, let's find the total minutes John spends in class. He has 6 periods a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, we multiply the minutes per day by the number of days: 
6 periods * 40 minutes per period = 240 minutes per day
240 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1200 minutes per week

However, John also takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, for 5 days a week. We need to add these minutes to the total: 
2 classes * 40 minutes per class = 80 minutes per day
80 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 400 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes: 
1200 minutes per week + 400 minutes per week = 1600 minutes per week

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He dedicates 1/16 of his weekly minutes to learning on these days. 
First, let's find the total minutes in a week: 
7 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 1680 minutes per week
1/16 * 1680 minutes per week = 105 minutes per day
105 minutes per day * 2 days = 210 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes, and the extra minutes for Saturday and Sunday: 
1600 minutes per week + 210 minutes per week = 1810 minutes per week

Finally, let's convert the total minutes to hours: 
1810 minutes per week / 60 minutes per hour = 30.17 hours per week

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the initial height of the ball. Since Nathan drops it from the third-floor balcony in the mall, and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

Now, we need to find the height of the ball after the first bounce. The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height, so we multiply 72 by 2/3. 

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the numerator (2) by the number and then divide by the denominator (3). So, 72 * 2 = 144, and then 144 / 3 = 48.

Now that we have the height after the first bounce, we need to find the height after the second bounce. We multiply 48 by 2/3, which is the same process as before. 

48 * 2 = 96, and then 96 / 3 = 32.

So, the height of the ball on its second bounce is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the heights of Caroline's children step by step.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned from selling apples, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"Let's solve this puzzle together. We know that a group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. 

Since the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what the velociraptors had, we can calculate the velociraptors' share. To do this, we multiply 270 by 2, which gives us 540 kilograms.

Now, we know that the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. So, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. The velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate. To find out how much the T-Rex ate, we multiply 540 by 2, which gives us 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, we can find the original weight of the triceratops by multiplying 1080 by 2. This gives us 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's break down the situation. Ellen initially had 12 sodas, and she shook 3 of them. Then, she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas. Her brother came by and took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, which means there's 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas left.

Now, Ellen's friend is about to choose a soda. There's 1 shaken can out of a total of 7 cans. To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 14.29%."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two trains traveling in opposite directions. One train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the other is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the distance each train has traveled after 3 hours, we multiply their speeds by the time they've been traveling. The first train has traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles. The second train has traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they're traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them. So, 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many people Billy helps, we first need to determine the total number of days he works between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, multiply the number of days Billy helps by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he helps: 
40 * 6 = 240

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there were 12 buses and 20 private cars parked outside the church. After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported, as there is no other information provided.

The final answer is: 480"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than him. To find Martha's age, we subtract 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we add 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two waterslides: the biggest one is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet per minute, while the second biggest slide is 240 feet long but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet per minute.

To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed of the slide. For the biggest slide, the time is 300 / 60 = 5 minutes. For the second biggest slide, the time is 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides. This is simply 5 - 3 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Bobby's daily schedule. He takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 

The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.
The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so we can calculate Micah's miles by multiplying 8 by 3.5.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down Sheila's credit card transactions step by step.

First, Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. Then, she returned one item that cost $15.00. This means we need to subtract the cost of the returned item from the initial charge.

$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00

Next, Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price of the frying pan.

$20.00 (original price) - $4.00 (discount) = $16.00

Sheila also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price of the towels.

$30.00 (original price) - $3.00 (discount) = $27.00

The total cost of the new purchases is the sum of the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels.

$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

Finally, we add the total cost of the new purchases to the previous balance to get the new balance on Sheila's credit card.

$70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many jellyfish are in the tank.

Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 
A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. 

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris. To find Ben's age, we multiply Chris's age by 2:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement and then determine how many years it will take her to save that amount.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, her annual savings will be:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

Next, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary in retirement, her annual retirement income will be:

Annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

Total savings needed = Annual retirement income * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Now, we need to calculate how many years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of $20,000 per year:

Number of years = Total savings needed / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into, and then divide that result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into.

First, divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, divide the result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can find the total number of students by dividing the number of boys by the decimal equivalent of 40%.

40% as a decimal is 0.4, so we divide 240 by 0.4: 240 / 0.4 = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you figure out how much your mom spent at the gardening shop.

To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the coupon discount.

The cost of the pots is $19, and the cost of the garden soil is $26. Let's add those together: $19 + $26 = $45.

Now, we need to subtract the $7 discount from the total. So, $45 - $7 = $38.

So, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and divide it by the total number of women.

There are 3 women wearing 4 inch heels and 3 women wearing 2 inch heels. 

The total height of the 4 inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2 inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The total number of women is 3 + 3 = 6.

The average height of heels is the total height divided by the total number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

The final answer is: 60"

There are 3 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 25 green balls in the store. The prices of these balls are $9, $5, and $3 respectively.

To find the total revenue, we need to multiply the number of each type of ball by its price and then add the results together.

Red balls: 3 balls * $9 per ball = $27
Blue balls: 11 balls * $5 per ball = $55
Green balls: 25 balls * $3 per ball = $75

Now, let's add the revenues together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will receive a total of $157 after selling all the balls."

"To find the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

The previous year's enrollment was 50 students. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 0.20 by 50, which equals 10 students.

Now, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60 students.

The number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we need to determine the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

"Let's count the number of male and female fishes in Tate's garden pond. 

Initially, there are 4 male guppies and 7 female guppies. Tate buys 2 more male guppies and 1 female guppy, so the total number of male guppies is 4 + 2 = 6 and the total number of female guppies is 7 + 1 = 8.

There are also 3 male goldfishes and 5 female goldfishes initially. Tate buys 2 more male goldfishes and 3 female goldfishes, so the total number of male goldfishes is 3 + 2 = 5 and the total number of female goldfishes is 5 + 3 = 8.

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes. The total number of male fishes is 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11. The total number of female fishes is 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16.

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes: 16 - 11 = 5.

"Hello there. To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to calculate the total distance of a round trip and then multiply it by the number of times he visits them in a month.

First, let's find the distance of a one-way trip. We know it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents at a speed of 70 mph. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Now, we know John visits his parents twice a month. So, we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. To find out how far she will walk in 7 days, we multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days: 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks. To find Brian's distance, we divide Sofie's total distance by 2: 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. 

First, let's find the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 1 hour. 
2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
Total toys per hour for these 4 workers = 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 10 hours. 
Total toys produced by these 4 workers in 10 hours = 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. 
The fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys, which is 420 - 200 = 220 toys. 
Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour is 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 22"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we can find its weight by dividing 60 by 4. 

60 / 4 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we can find its weight by dividing 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30 pounds

Now, we need to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs by adding the weights of both of his dogs.

15 pounds + 30 pounds = 45 pounds

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weight of Elijah's dogs to the weight of Kory's dog.

45 pounds + 60 pounds = 105 pounds

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with John's M&M problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of M&M's John has. He bought 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Since an ounce of M&M's contains 30 M&M's, we can multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now that we know John has 900 M&M's, we need to find out how many small bags he can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's, so we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie the albatross to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to calculate half of the circumference of the earth.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that would be 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to cover this distance. Since he flies 400 kilometers every day, we can divide the total distance (20,000 km) by the distance he flies per day (400 km) to find out how many days it will take him to fly that distance.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so we can denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A and Madeline as M, and we can say A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so C + S = 30.

Additionally, we know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so C = S + 12.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S + 12 + S = 30, which simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them into boxes, with each box holding 8 crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

To find out how many boxes Nik will need, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we need to find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of their individual weights: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of it, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, we divide 64 by 4 to find the number of logs, as each log is 4 feet.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

"Let's break down the information given: Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice as much as Valerie, which means he earns $10,000 per month. To find their combined salary, we add Valerie's and her brother's earnings: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Now, we know their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's break down Grandma's walking routine. She walks 3 miles every day, consisting of 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. To find her speed on the beach, we can use the formula distance/speed = time. Since the distance on the beach is 2 miles and the time is 40 minutes, we can set up the equation 2/x = 40, where x is her speed in miles per minute.

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute. This is her speed on the beach.

Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down Jane's savings. She has been saving $4 of her allowance every week for 8 weeks. To find out how much she has saved so far, we multiply her weekly savings by the number of weeks:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's count the blue birds together. We have 3 trees with 7 blue birds in each, so that's 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds. Then, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds in each, which gives us 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds. And finally, there's 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

To find the total number of blue birds, we add the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24, we can set up an equation: x + 24 = 84, where x is the number of marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles. To find 'x', we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 84 - 24 = 60.

Now that we know Bob has 60 marbles before receiving 2 dozen more marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 60: 60 - 10 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water, one of which is 33 degrees. 

When he pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other bottle into his water bottle, he's able to drink the water. This means the temperature of the water in the bottle after the transfer must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. The total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle).

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40.

Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 / 2 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 >= 80
165 + 5x >= 80
5x >= 80 - 165
5x >= -85
x >= -85 / 5
x >= -17

However, the temperature of the water cannot be negative, so we need to find the minimum value of x that satisfies the condition. Since x cannot be negative, the minimum value of x is 40 degrees.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

The final answer is: 700"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, and each pack costs $10.00 with 9 bagels inside. To find the total cost of 4 packs, we multiply the cost of one pack by 4.

Total cost of 4 packs = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the total cost.
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00
Discounted cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
Number of bagels in one pack = 9
Total number of bagels in 4 packs = 4 * 9 = 36

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels.
Cost of each single bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

The final answer is: $1.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. It's given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. It's given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. Let's first find out how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

Now, we know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops. 

To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to find out how many groups of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops. 18 / 2 = 9. 

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, it takes 3 * 9 = 27 potatoes to make 18 scoops.

"Let's break down Chester's egg consumption over 60 days. 

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. To find the number of red jellybeans, we multiply the number of green jellybeans by 2: 17 * 2 = 34.

Now, we add the number of green jellybeans and red jellybeans to find the total number of green and red jellybeans: 17 + 34 = 51.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

"Hello there. Let's calculate the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade. 

To do this, we need to find out how many lemons he collects in a year. Since he has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, we need to find the total number of lemons he gets in a decade, which is 10 years. We multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

The fraction of women in the ratio is 9/14. 

To find the number of women on the bus, we multiply the fraction of women by the total number of passengers: (9/14) * 84 = 54.

Now, we subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus: 54 - 20 = 34.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days.

First, we need to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquet per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to get the number of bouquets sold per day.

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 12 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets.

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Next, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold per day from the individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from the sunflowers per day, we can divide $26 by $2 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day.

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can add the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

The final answer is: 291"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam has $100 to invest in his rock stand. He buys rocks for $5 each and sells them for $7 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * $5 = $100

However, Adam only made $84 from selling the rocks. To find out how much money he loses, we need to consider the cost of the rocks he didn't sell. Since he sold 12 rocks, he has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 + $40 = $140

Now, let's find out how much money Adam loses:

$140 - $84 = $56

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. She needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.

To find out how many days it will take her to complete the large-sized picture scenes, we divide the total number of large-sized scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 45 / 5 = 9 days.

For the medium-sized picture scenes, we divide the total number of medium-sized scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 36 / 6 = 6 days.

Lastly, for the small-sized picture scenes, we divide the total number of small-sized scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 49 / 7 = 7 days.

Now, we need to find the maximum of these values to determine the minimum number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project. The maximum of 9, 6, and 7 is 9.

"Let's break down the situation. Patricia initially had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother. To find out how many roses she has left, we subtract the roses she gave away from the initial number of roses.

30 (initial roses) - 24 (roses given away) = 6

After giving away 24 roses, Patricia had 6 roses left. Then, she bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add the roses she bought to the remaining roses.

6 (remaining roses) + 15 (roses bought) = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two lottery tickets, and we want to find the probability that both of them are winners.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"Let's break down the information given: Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. If we denote the number of seashells Carlos collected as C, then Jim collected C + 5 seashells. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, we can write the equation: C + 5 = 27. Solving for C, we get C = 22.

Now, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. If we denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as R, then Carlos collected 2R seashells. We already know that Carlos collected 22 seashells, so we can write the equation: 2R = 22. Solving for R, we get R = 11.

Now we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. The total number of seashells is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60. To find out how many seashells each person gets, we divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people): 60 / 3 = 20

"Hello there. Let's calculate how many carrots Mason eats in a week. 

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, which are Monday to Friday. There are 5 weekdays, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 carrots on weekdays.

On the weekend, Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday. So, he eats 5 + 5 = 10 carrots on the weekend.

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend. 
Total carrots eaten in a week = 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is 60% as a decimal).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes and 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Linus bought a mobile device for $20 and sold it for twice the amount of the original price, which is $40. 

To find the profit from each device, we subtract the cost price from the selling price: $40 - $20 = $20. 

Since Linus bought 2 devices on Monday, the total cost price for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. The total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost price for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"My cousin Ned is two feet shorter than I am, and I'm 7 feet tall. So, to find Ned's height, I'll subtract 2 feet from my height.

Ned's height = My height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Now, my brother Carl is one foot taller than Ned. To find Carl's height, I'll add 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, I'll divide his height by 2 to find the length of his cane.

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

"To determine how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Carla has 8 identical octuplets, and she dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue.

First, we need to find out how many babies are wearing purple and how many are wearing blue. To do this, we multiply the total number of babies by the fraction of each color.

Number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2

Next, we need to find out how many babies wearing purple and blue are also wearing bows. We know that 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows, so we multiply the number of purple babies by 1/3.

Number of babies wearing purple and bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2

We also know that all the blue babies are wearing bows, so we add that to the number of purple babies wearing bows.

Total number of babies wearing bows: 2 (purple) + 2 (blue) = 4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple by dividing the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiplying by 100.

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

So, the answer is 50%."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land.

First, Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. To find the total number of eggs hidden, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's consider the number of eggs found by each person. Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs found, we add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"Hello there. Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of apartments. The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

"Hello there. Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life.

First, we know that a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits. Then, a 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.

Next, a 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

Now, let's consider the 8-year-old tree. We're told it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. To find the production of a 10-year-old tree, we need to consider the production of a 10-year-old tree, which is 20 times the initial amount of fruits, or 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now that we know the production of a 10-year-old tree, we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree. Since it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Moving on, we know that a 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits. Finally, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which we've already calculated to be 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. We know that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can express the combined length of the ropes as R + B + Y = 37. Substituting R = 4B into this equation, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Now, substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37. This gives us 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37. Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12. Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. If Ronnie was given $5, then Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.
(15 - x) = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given about the wall mural. There are four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. We know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Additionally, we're told that half the mural is yellow, and the total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Tom has 4 bedrooms in his house, and each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet. To find the total area of the bedrooms, we multiply the length and width of one bedroom: 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, we multiply this by 4 to get the total area of the bedrooms: 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

Next, we're told that the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. So, we multiply the area of one bedroom by 5 to find the area of the living room: 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

We're also given that the rest of the house has an area of 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add up the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a special size box of dishwasher pods that costs the same as a regular box, which is $12. However, this special box has 20% more pods than the regular box.

First, we need to find out how many pods are in the special box. To do this, we calculate 20% of 100, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So, the special box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we know that we can run 120 cycles with the special box for $12, since we use 1 pod per cycle. To find out how many cycles we can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

So, with the special box, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days he can use the chalk after Monday.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of girls by 1/3. The total number of girls is 12, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.

Next, we need to find the number of boys on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of boys by 1/4. The total number of boys is 12, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity. This is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students. The total number of students is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24. Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. James has 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. 

First, we need to find the number of teeth the dentist caps. Since the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, and he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth he caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we need to find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. This is the sum of the teeth he drills and the teeth he caps, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, and then multiply by 100. So, (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Bob has $27,000 to spend on books and that he can buy 100 books for $500. 

First, we need to find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with his money. To do this, we'll divide the total amount of money by the cost of 100 books.

Total books = Total money / Cost per 100 books
Total books = $27,000 / $500
Total books = 54

Since Bob is distributing the money to 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of sets of 100 books by 3 to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy per school.

Sets of 100 books per school = Total sets of 100 books / Number of schools
Sets of 100 books per school = 54 / 3
Sets of 100 books per school = 18

Now, to find out how many individual books Bob can buy per school, we multiply the number of sets of 100 books by 100.

Books per school = Sets of 100 books per school * 100
Books per school = 18 * 100
Books per school = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"

3. He put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 5 apples in his pocket. Total apples = 1 (outside) + 5 (in pocket) = 6.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples. Total apples = 6 (from previous step) + 6 (new) = 12.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, so he now has 12 apples in total.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples."
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to calculate the number of bags of coal he ordered and multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, let's determine the number of bags of coal Ali ordered. Since the coal is delivered in 50 kg bags, we divide the total weight of coal by the weight per bag:

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, we know that each bag costs $18. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To figure out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's start by calculating the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat. 

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. To find out how many snowballs he builds per minute, we divide 20 by 60, which gives us 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, we also need to consider that 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which they melt, we divide 2 by 15, which gives us 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, let's find the net rate of snowballs by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate: (1/3) - (2/15). To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15. So, we can rewrite 1/3 as 5/15. Now we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3, which gives us 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how long it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. To do this, we divide the number of snowballs by the rate: 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 50 / 2 = 25).
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages (since they ordered 1 pack of 50).
After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages.
After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100 bandages (since they ordered 2 packs of 50).

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

"Hello there. To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April. Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

"Let's break down the problem step by step. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. To find the cost per bottle of scotch, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Now, let's consider the cognac. John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which means he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the scotch and add it to the cost of the scotch to find the cost per bottle of cognac. 50% of $60 is $60 * 0.5 = $30. Adding this to the cost of the scotch gives us $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle of cognac.

To find the total cost of the cognac, we multiply the cost per bottle by the number of bottles: 20 * $90 = $1800.

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spent: $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Lodgepole Pine: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

"Let's break down the situation. Amy initially had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so she had a total of 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one palette, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"Let's break down the information given about Mattison's house. We know that Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, which means the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so it's 3 * 60 = 180 inches. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the first floor's height from the total height of the house:
420 - 180 = 240 inches

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house:
420 - 240 = 180 inches

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

The final answer is: 180"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 20 tourists divided into three groups to find as many shells as possible in a strip mall parking lot. They discovered a total of 700 shells.

First, we need to find the number of shells found by team Alphas, which is 40% of the total shells.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share.

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Bernie has 4 dogs, and they need to walk a total of 12 miles on average per day. The first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second needs to walk 4 miles, and the third needs to walk 3 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all 4 dogs. 

First, let's add up the miles walked by the first three dogs: 
1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles.

Now, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all 4 dogs: 
12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

The last dog needs 4 miles."
"Let's break down John's situation. He's mortgaging his house, which is worth $250,000. He gets a loan for 40% of that amount. 

First, we need to find 40% of $250,000. To do this, we multiply 0.4 by $250,000. 

0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of this loan to pay off his debts. We find 60% of $100,000 by multiplying 0.6 by $100,000.

0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To find out how much money John has leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the amount borrowed.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's calculate Deandre's earnings from selling the tunas.

The first tuna he caught weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. To find the total weight of the tunas, we need to add their weights together.

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 
The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the dehumidifier has three settings: low, medium, and high. The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, the medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting, and the high setting removes twice as much as the medium setting.

The medium setting removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day, and the high setting removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.

Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

Next, he ran it for 3 days on the medium setting, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

Finally, he ran it for 5 days on the high setting, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

To find the total amount of water removed, we add the amounts from each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many balloons were thrown during Jolene's water balloon fight, we need to calculate the total number of balloons and then subtract the number of balloons left.

First, let's find the total number of balloons. Jolene and her friends filled up 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons. So, the total number of balloons is 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.

Now, we know that 12 balloons were left at the end of the afternoon. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons: 300 - 12 = 288.

The final answer is: 288"
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the capacity of John's classes, we need to find 1/8 of Ali's class capacity. 

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. 
1/8 of 120 is 120 / 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 
Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

The final answer is: 150"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. 

First, we need to calculate the interest he owes. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

Now, let's find the remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. This is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's break down the problem. Jordan has 2 children, and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day. To find the total number of diaper changes per day, we multiply the number of children by the number of diaper changes per child: 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we need to find half of the total number of diaper changes. Half of 10 is 5. This means Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day, Jordan must change the remaining half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's dive into the problem. We're given a jar with a square base, measuring 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall. We need to find out how far off Tim's guess was about the number of red jelly beans in the jar.

First, we calculate the total volume of the jar by multiplying its length, width, and height.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Now, we find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean, which is 0.15 cubic inches.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we're told that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't state that Tim made a guess. For the sake of solving the problem, let's assume he guessed the number of red jelly beans to be 864.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total number of people 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down Pauline's museum visits. She goes to the museum 3 times a year. Initially, the cost of one visit is $2. So, the annual cost for her visits is 3 * $2 = $6. For the first 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's consider the increased cost. The cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

To find the total cost for all visits, we add the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from the total number of students. 

There are 4 grades (4-7), and each grade has 10 students. So, the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many groups can be formed: 40 / 8 = 5.

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, and there are 5 groups. Therefore, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Ian has a 40-foot board and he wants to make a cut so he can have two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine how much of Aiden's secret seasoning he needs, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total seasoning needed.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you figure out how much fabric Luke should buy for his new curtains. 

First, we need to find the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows, and each one is 35 inches wide, we can multiply the width of one window by the number of windows.

Width of one window: 35 inches
Number of windows: 5

Total width of windows = 35 * 5 = 175 inches

Now, Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 = 350 inches

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be x, then the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation:
x + 3x - 2 = 10
4x - 2 = 10
4x = 12
x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost, let's start with the manicure and pedicure prices. A basic manicure starts at $35, and a pedicure starts at $40. If Karen chooses to get both, she'll receive a 20% discount on the total price of both.

The discount on the manicure is 20% of $35, which is 0.2 * 35 = $7. 
The discount on the pedicure is 20% of $40, which is 0.2 * 40 = $8.

The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15.

The cost of the manicure after the discount is $35 - $7 = $28.
The cost of the pedicure after the discount is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

First, Walter bought 60 apples from the store. To find out how many apples he ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find the number of apples remaining.

60 - 24 = 36

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples.

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, let's find the number of apples remaining.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is 36 / 12 = 3 pies.

Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) + 36 (by their mother) = 102 grapes.

First, we need to find the total cost of the eggs. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen, we multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen.

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many sets of 3 eggs Rose can sell. 

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since she sells each set for $1, the total revenue will be:

20 sets * $1/set = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Skyler has 100 hats in total. Half of them are red, which is 100 * 0.5 = 50 red hats.

Now, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red ones. That would be 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 50 by 3/5, which is 50 * (3/5) = 30 blue hats.

Now, we know that the remaining hats are white. So, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is: 20"

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. 

First, let's find out how many questions she got right on the first test. 60% of 70 questions is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, and the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions right. 
70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since she got 42 questions right on the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Mary makes some strawberry cubes and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes in total, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We can express the number of blueberry cubes in terms of the number of strawberry cubes: B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116: S + B = 116.

Now, let's substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

The final answer is: 96"

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus, we need to break down the process step by step.

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the car dealership, 1 will buy a car. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the car dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 person comes into the car dealership. To get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"Let's break down the situation. There are 8 rooms in Brianna's house, and her family has a flashlight for each of the 4 people living there. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Now, let's count the candles. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

"Let's break down Phineas Frog's journey to return home. He's been washed away by a rainstorm and needs to hop and swim his way back. We know he hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute on land and swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute in water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the time it takes for each part of the journey. The total distance is 200 yards, so half of it is 100 yards.

To cover 100 yards on land at 20 yards per minute, it would take Phineas 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

To cover 100 yards in water at 10 yards per minute, it would take Phineas 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Adding these two times together, we get 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have five phones on a phone plan, and the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. The main phone costs $20.

To find the cost of the additional phones, we need to determine the cost of one additional phone. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, we can set up an equation to find the cost of one additional phone.

Let's call the cost of one additional phone ""x"". Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x. We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of one additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Conor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun. On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were present at the beach than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Garrett is popping popcorn, and we need to find the total number of pieces he has to eat.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to three times the initial amount, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial popping rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make. He's planning to make 4 gallons for the party, and his friend Allen asked him to make an extra gallon that's twice as tart as the others. So, the total amount of lemonade is 4 + 1 = 5 gallons.

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many cups of juice are needed for 5 gallons. That's 5 cups of juice.

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade. This lemonade is twice as tart as the other gallons, which means it requires twice the amount of lemon juice. So, the extra tart lemonade needs 2 cups of juice.

For the extra tart lemonade, we need 2 cups of juice, which is equivalent to 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons.

For the regular lemonade, we need 5 cups of juice, which is equivalent to 5/6 * 6 = 5 lemons.

In total, Tim needs 2 lemons for the extra tart lemonade and 5 lemons for the regular lemonade, so he needs 2 + 5 = 7 lemons.

20 * 2 = 40

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract those from the total required:
40 - 4 = 36

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2. To do this, we divide the total hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:
36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
6 * 2 = 12

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down Frances' sales and expenses. She sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each, so her total earnings from cupcakes are 20 * $2 = $40. She also sells 40 cookies for $1 each, which gives her 40 * $1 = $40. Adding these together, her total earnings are $40 + $40 = $80.

Frances buys five trays at $4 each, so her total expenses are 5 * $4 = $20.

To find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings: $80 - $20 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

At the end of the first street, there are 5 children. 

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

The original 5 children then leave the group, so we subtract 5 from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's calculate how many meals Mamou has left to distribute. 

To do this, we need to find out how many meals she has already given out. On Friday, she gave out 64 meals, on Saturday she gave out 30 meals, and on Sunday she gave out 48 meals. 

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48
Total meals given out = 142

Now, we need to subtract the total meals given out from the total number of meals Mamou has. 

Total meals Mamou has = 1,360
Meals left to distribute = Total meals Mamou has - Total meals given out
Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142
Meals left to distribute = 1,218

The final answer is: 1218"

"Let's break down the information given. We have 2 brothers and 3 sisters in the family. The sisters are all the same age, which is 16 years old. One of the brothers is 12 years old, and this is half the age of the older brother.

Since one brother is 12 years old, the older brother must be 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

The total age of the 3 sisters is 16 * 3 = 48 years.

The total age of the 2 brothers is 12 + 24 = 36 years.

To find the total age of all the siblings, we add the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters: 48 + 36 = 84 years.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, let's break it down. Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, which is a total of 30 minutes per day. Since she meditates 7 days a week, the total meditation time per week is 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

For yoga, she practices for 1 hour, or 60 minutes, 5 days a week. So, the total yoga time per week is 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week.

To find the total time spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"To find the total square feet of fabric used for the quilt, we need to calculate the total square feet from each type of shirt and add them together.

First, let's calculate the total square feet from the small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.

Next, we calculate the total square feet from the medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.

Lastly, we calculate the total square feet from the large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the total square feet from each type of shirt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101

The final answer is: 101"
"Hello there. Let's calculate the total number of sunflower seeds. 

First, we need to find the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

Now, let's find the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. Then, we add this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

To find the total number of seeds, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that George has 18 pens. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has by multiplying 18 by 3. 

18 * 3 = 54

Now, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can calculate the number of pens Sarah has by dividing the number of pens Timothy has by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, we subtract 2"" from Anne's height to find Jackie's current height: 72 - 2 = 70"".

Now, we know Jackie grew 3"" over the summer. To find her height before summer, we subtract the growth from her current height: 70 - 3 = 67"".

So, Jackie's height before summer was 67""."
"To find out how much money the company receives for selling the produced chocolate bars, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

In one day, the company produces 5000 bars. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, the company produces 5000 * 7 = 35000 bars.

In two weeks, the company produces 35000 * 2 = 70000 bars.

The price per bar is $2. So, the total money the company receives is 70000 * 2 = $140000.

The final answer is: $140000"
"I'd be happy to help Jake figure out how much he spent at the store.

Let's start with the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, but there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, he only pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Now, let's move on to the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Ryan's problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Ryan gets $6 each week he completes his chores, and he did his chores for 3 weeks. So, his total allowance is 6 * 3 = $18.

Next, he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. That's a total of 4 cones, so the cost is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total allowance: $18 - $5 = $13.

Finally, we need to find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy. Each ticket costs $6.50, so we'll divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you calculate how much Josh makes in 2 weeks.

Josh runs a car shop and services 3 cars a day. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. He gets paid $4 per car.

To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday) and not open 2 days a week (Sunday and Wednesday). So, he is open 5 days a week.

In 1 week, Josh is open 5 days, so he services 5 * 3 = 15 cars.

In 2 weeks, Josh is open 10 days, so he services 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 2 weeks, he makes 30 * $4 = $120.

"Let's break down the situation with Randy and his cookies. He starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. That's a total of 18 cookies.

Randy then eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This means he's down to 18 - 3 = 15 cookies.

Next, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, leaving him with 9 - 2 = 7 oatmeal cookies. He still has 4 chocolate chip cookies and 5 sugar cookies, so the total is now 7 + 4 + 5 = 16 cookies.

Randy then gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, leaving him with 5 - 2 = 3 sugar cookies. The total number of cookies now is 7 + 4 + 3 = 14.

Finally, Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. This adds 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies to his collection.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:
Total cookies initially = 18
Cookies eaten or given away = 3 (snack) + 2 (lunch) + 2 (given away) = 7
Cookies baked = 12

Total cookies now = Total cookies initially - Cookies eaten or given away + Cookies baked
Total cookies now = 18 - 7 + 12
Total cookies now = 23

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. He wants to sell them for a fair price. He found a buyer who is willing to pay for half his collection $5 per toy, and for the other half $7 per toy.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, he can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30.

For the second half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.

To find the total amount, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day, and Nate is on vacation for 14 days. To find the total number of holes dug, we multiply the number of holes dug per day by the number of days Nate was on vacation.

Holes dug per day = 6
Days Nate was on vacation = 14
Total holes dug = 6 * 14 = 84

Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to add these to the total holes dug during the day. However, the problem doesn't specify how many days Nate fills the holes, so we'll assume he fills the holes for the same number of days he was on vacation.

Holes dug at night = 6 * 14 = 84
Total holes = 84 + 84 = 168

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 / 3
Days to fill holes = 56

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7.

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 8

"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Average enrollment at Norman High School: 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School: 4000 * (3/4) = 3000 students

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in enrollment: 4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"

"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: This means he gathered 12 Petri dishes, since 14 - 2 = 12.
- Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 12 Petri dishes = 27 items.

Since Igor had 29 items on the lab bench, he must have lost 29 - 27 = 2 beakers.

"Let's break down the information given:

Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. Vanessa ran 4 miles, which means Aaron ran half the distance, so he ran 2 miles.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron runs 2 miles in x minutes, Vanessa runs 2 miles in 2x minutes. We know Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Aaron runs 2 miles in 8 minutes, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 2 miles:
Vanessa runs 2 miles in 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes

Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, and Aaron ran 2 miles, Vanessa ran 4 miles. Therefore, it takes Vanessa 16 minutes to run 2 miles, so it takes her 16 * 2 = 32 minutes to run 4 miles.

However, we are asked for the time it takes Vanessa to complete her part of the race, which is 4 miles. Since we know it takes her 32 minutes to run 4 miles, the answer is:

"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. 

Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3: 
200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

He already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total amount needed: 
600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find the cost of each watermelon, we need to first find the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

The profit percentage is 25%, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit). 

The cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Let's find the cost price of 1 watermelon: 
Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

Now, let's find the selling price of 1 watermelon:
Selling price of 50 watermelons = 125% of $80
Selling price of 50 watermelons = (125/100) * $80 = $100
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange and Jane spends 4 minutes doing the same. If they start peeling oranges at the same time, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 60 by the time it takes Ana to peel an orange, which is 3 minutes. This gives us 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour. We divide 60 by the time it takes Jane to peel an orange, which is 4 minutes. This gives us 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges peeled by Jane from the number of oranges peeled by Ana: 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"Let's break down the cost of Mark's new radiator and installation.

First, Mark gets a discount on the radiator at a junk shop. The original cost of the radiator is $400. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original cost by the discount percentage (80% off). The discount amount is 400 * 0.8 = $320. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to get the cost of the radiator after the discount: 400 - 320 = $80.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * 50 = $150.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost: 80 + 150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals on his farm, and they are all either chickens or cows. We also know that the total number of legs is 70.

Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can set up the following equation: 2C + 4W = 70.

We also know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can set up another equation: C + W = 20.

Now, let's solve the second equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the first equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

So, the number of chickens on the farm is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
