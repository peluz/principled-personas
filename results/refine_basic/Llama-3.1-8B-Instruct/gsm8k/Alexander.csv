"Let's break down Janet's daily egg sales. She lays 16 eggs per day. For breakfast, she consumes 3 eggs, and for baking muffins, she uses 4 eggs. 

The total number of eggs used is 3 + 4 = 7. 

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 

To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber required. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half that much white fiber, we calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"The art of flipping a house. It's a bold move, indeed. Josh has bought a house for $80,000 and then invested a significant amount in repairs, a whopping $50,000. This substantial investment increased the value of the house by a staggering 150%. 

To calculate the new value of the house, we need to consider the original value and the increase. The original value of the house was $80,000. The 150% increase can be calculated as 1.5 times the original value. 

New value = Original value + (Original value * 150%)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon. 

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8, which is 0.6 * $1.8 = $1.08. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time. 

This forms a geometric sequence with the first term a = $5 and the common ratio r = 0.6. The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula: S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r).

We want to find the sum of the first 16 terms. Plugging in the values, we get: 
S_16 = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)

S_16 = $5 * (1 - 0.00006103515625) / 0.4
S_16 = $5 * 0.99993896484375 / 0.4
S_16 = $5 * 2.49959726671875
S_16 = $12.4974863345625

However, this is the sum of the first 16 terms of the sequence, but we need to add the cost of the first glass. 
Total cost = $5 + $12.4974863345625
Total cost ≈ $17.4974863345625

The total cost is approximately $17.50."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB. The time to download 120 GB is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. The time to install the updates is given as 20 minutes. So, the total time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each segment of his trip and then determine his position.

1. Distance traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

2. Distance traveled in the first 2 hours of the return trip in standstill traffic:
Distance = Speed * Time
Since he is not moving, the distance is 0 miles.

3. Distance traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

4. Distance traveled in the remaining 2 hours of the return trip at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 160 = 175 miles

Now, let's consider the time John has spent driving in the return trip. He spent 2 hours in standstill traffic and 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph, and 2 hours driving at 80 mph. The total time spent driving in the return trip is 2.5 hours.

Since John started driving at 3 hours, he has been driving for a total of 3 + 2.5 = 5.5 hours.

However, we are interested in the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours. Since he has been driving for 5.5 hours, he has 0.5 hours left to drive.

In the remaining 0.5 hours, he will be driving at 80 mph. 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 0.5
Distance = 40 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours. He has traveled 180 miles in the first 3 hours and 175 miles in the return trip. However, he still has 40 miles to travel in the remaining 0.5 hours.

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles
Distance traveled in the remaining 0.5 hours = 40 miles

Total distance traveled = 180 + 175 + 40 = 395 miles

Since John is now 395 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours is 395 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{395}$"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 * $10 = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month, so we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost of the pastries, we need to calculate the cost of each type and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts. 3 dozen donuts cost $68 per dozen, so 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. 2 dozen mini cupcakes cost $80 per dozen, so 2 * $80 = $160.

Lastly, we'll find the cost of the mini cheesecakes. 6 dozen mini cheesecakes cost $55 per dozen, so 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the initial cost of the lemon tree is $90. Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, generating a revenue of $10.5 per year. However, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year, resulting in a net revenue of $7.5 per year.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to calculate the time it takes for the tree to pay for itself. We can do this by dividing the initial cost by the net revenue:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.5 (net revenue) = 12 years

However, this calculation tells us when the tree will pay for itself, not when it starts earning money. Since the tree will start generating revenue in the first year, we can conclude that it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with ""x"". So, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

After selling at the green house, she had (x - x/3) = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners left.

She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

After selling at the red house, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2x/3 - 2) is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = (x/3 - 1).

So, she had (2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1)) = (x/3 - 1) vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the best purchase option for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each item.

The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, so the increase in value for the $5,000 jewelry is 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * $5,000 = $125.

The electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%, so the increase in value for the $8,000 electronic gadgets is 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Since the jewelry has a higher potential increase in value, the merchant should choose the jewelry.

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125.

The final answer is: $125"
"The problem states that two trains leave San Rafael at the same time and travel in a westward direction for 80 miles. The next day, they travel northward for 150 miles. To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to consider the combined distances traveled in both directions.

Since the trains travel in two different directions, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance covered by each train. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Let's apply this theorem to the problem:

The westward distance is 80 miles, and the northward distance is 150 miles. We can use these values as the two sides of the right-angled triangle and find the hypotenuse, which represents the total distance covered by each train.

Total distance = √(80^2 + 150^2)
Total distance = √(6400 + 22500)
Total distance = √28900
Total distance = 170 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. Jill gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked per year to get the total hours worked per year: 35 * 50 = 1750. Then, we multiply the total hours worked per year by her hourly wage: 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. Jill gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Again, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked per year to get the total hours worked per year: 15 * 50 = 750. Then, we multiply the total hours worked per year by her hourly wage: 750 * $30 = $22,500.

Now, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching to get her total annual salary: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks and multiply it by the number of eggs she eats per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Claire eats 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down Marissa's hike. She's already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and another 2 miles in 1 hour, so she's covered 6 miles in 2 hours. To find the total time she needs to complete the 12-mile hike at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can divide the total distance by her desired average speed:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since she's already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 
Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.
Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling. 
The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water.
The remaining amount of water is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. 
Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, and we have 14.67 liters of water, the remaining amount of non-water liquid is 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. 
Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

"Let's break down the sales for Billy on Tuesday. He had 8 customers in total. The first 3 customers bought one DVD each, so they purchased a total of 3 DVDs. The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, which is a total of 4 DVDs. The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers. 

3 + 4 = 7

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To determine how much shorter a candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns for 4 hours, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased other than the pizza boxes. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15, and the cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

Adding these costs together, we get $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Now, we subtract this total from the amount Marie paid, which is $50. This gives us $50 - $33 = $17. 

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide 60 by 15:
60 / 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Gloria has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much.

Since the more expensive pair of heels costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, we can express the cost of the more expensive pair as 2 * 33 = $66.

Now, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: B = 33 + 66 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

The final answer is: $94"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

"Let's break down the guesses. The first person thinks there are 80 jelly beans in the jar. The second person thinks there are 20 more than half of the first one, which is 40 + 20 = 60. The third person thinks there are 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100.

To find the average, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of people. The total number of guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. There are 3 people.

The average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to calculate the time spent on each dog and then multiply it by the number of dogs.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since there are 10 dogs, we multiply the time per dog by the number of dogs.

Time per dog: 0.5 hours
Number of dogs: 10

Total time per day = Time per dog * Number of dogs
Total time per day = 0.5 * 10
Total time per day = 5 hours

Now, we need to find the total time spent in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the total time per day by 7.

Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7
Total time per week = 35 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G.

We can set up two equations based on the given information. The first equation is S + G = 110, which represents the total number of coins. The second equation is G = S + 30, which represents the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins.

Now, let's substitute the second equation into the first one: S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Let's break down the information given about the jewels.

Raymond has 40 jewels. To find out how many jewels Aaron has, we need to calculate half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5 to that number. Half of 40 is 20, and 20 + 5 is 25. So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total. 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in that time frame. 

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Since each set costs $5.00, Terry spends 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = 195 dollars.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is 8 * 20 = 160 dollars.

John also has $5 left, which means he spent 195 - 5 = 190 dollars on the video games.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $35, which is the amount he used from his own money. 
35 / 15 = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 11 sets with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time.
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to determine her walking and running speeds. We know that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, and it's half as fast as her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends walking and running. We know she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In six hours, she spends 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking and 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running.

The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Let's analyze the situation. We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age by multiplying Suzy's age by 2. 

Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1 = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. To find Brandon's iPhone age, we multiply Ben's iPhone age by 4.

Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2 = 8 years

The final answer is: 8"
"The great dragon, Perg, sits atop mount Farbo, breathing fire that reaches 1000 feet in all directions. Polly, a skilled warrior, possesses a gold javelin that can slay the beast. However, the javelin's range is limited to 400 feet when thrown without any assistance. 

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, her throwing distance triples. To find the new range, we multiply the original distance by 3.

New range = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to calculate the total number of pieces initially available and then subtract the remaining pieces.

First, we find the total number of pieces: 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

Then, we subtract the remaining pieces: 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can still eat, we first need to find out how many calories you can consume. Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you've already consumed 1800 calories. 

Subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Now, we know a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams you can eat, multiply the number of servings you can still have by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he makes and sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to find the total cost. Since Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. 

Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $10.00 per pound * 2
Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $20.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Total number of articles written in 3 days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She then purchased a package of Post-it notes and used 220 of them at work. After that, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to determine the total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package. We can do this by adding the initial Post-it notes and the ones she purchased, then subtracting the ones she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x. The total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package is 80 (initial) + x (package) - 220 (used) + 23 (remaining).

Since the total Post-it notes after purchasing the package is equal to the sum of the initial Post-it notes, the Post-it notes used, and the Post-it notes remaining, we can set up the equation:

x + 23 = 80 + 220 - 23

Simplifying the equation:
x + 23 = 277 - 23
x + 23 = 254
x = 254 - 23
x = 231

The final answer is: 231"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie: 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. We know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the red ties cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

To find the total cost of red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie: 10 * 60 = $600.

Finally, we add the cost of blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces of wire Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply 4 feet by 12 to get the total length in inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. So, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: 120 units * 1/4 = 30 units.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week:
Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. To find the total number of eggs per week, we multiply this by 7 days:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens are produced per week:
1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spent traveling back.

The distance from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours. Since Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, the distance is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

The time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour is 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Now, we need to find the time it took to travel back. The distance is the same, 30 miles. Since Tom's ship can travel at 6 mph, the time it took to travel back is 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

The total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, and he removes 30 of them. To find the total weight of the comic books, we multiply the weight of one comic book by the number of comic books: 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can calculate the number of toys by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy. The remaining weight is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. So, we divide 7.5 by 0.5 to get the number of toys: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the revenue earned from repairing truck tires and car tires on Thursday. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire.

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Next, we need to calculate the revenue earned from repairing car tires on Friday. Since no truck tires were repaired, we only need to consider the car tires.

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

"My dear fellow, let us tackle this problem together. We have a basket containing 25 oranges, and we are tasked with determining the number of good oranges.

First, we must identify the oranges that are not good. We know that 1 orange is bad, and 20% of the total oranges are unripe. To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate 20% of 25.

20% of 25 = (20/100) * 25 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Now, we add the number of bad and unripe oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

The second level will have half the square footage of the top level, which is 16 / 2 = 8.
The third level will have half the square footage of the second level, which is 8 / 2 = 4.
The fourth level will have half the square footage of the third level, which is 4 / 2 = 2.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in that time.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, let's find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to compare the cost per flower of each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the grooming is $100. To find 30% of this amount, we multiply it by 0.3.

30% of $100 = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the cost after the discount.

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters. 

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

The boy got 6 liters of water. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy. 
Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

Now, let's subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water. 
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

"To find my weight, we need to calculate 4 times what my sister Grace weighs and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. 

4 times what Grace weighs is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
I weigh 2 pounds less than that, so I weigh 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

To find our combined weights, we add my weight and Grace's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

First, let's start with the number of rose bushes: 3. Each of these bushes has 25 roses. So, we multiply 3 by 25 to get the total number of roses: 3 * 25 = 75.

Now, we know each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600.

The total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's break down the problem. We know that the football team played a total of 22 games. We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost. 

Let's denote the number of games they lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We can express the relationship between W and L as W = L + 8.

We also know that the total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost, so W + L = 22.

Now, we can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7

Now that we know L, we can find W: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

He goes on 4 vacations per year, so the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The alarm rings three times a day, but the duration of each ring is different.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 10% increase for 5 years, and then calculate the salary for the next 3 years.

The initial salary is $600. An increase of 10% of $600 is $60. So, the salary after 5 years is $600 + ($60 * 5) = $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

The increase for the next year is 10% of $900, which is $90. So, the salary after 6 years is $900 + $90 = $990. The increase for the next year is 10% of $990, which is $99. So, the salary after 7 years is $990 + $99 = $1089. The increase for the next year is 10% of $1089, which is $109.1. So, the salary after 8 years is $1089 + $109.1 = $1198.1. The increase for the next year is 10% of $1198.1, which is $119.81. So, the salary after 9 years is $1198.1 + $119.81 = $1317.91.

The final answer is: $1317.91"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we denote the number of copies Harald sold as H, then the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To determine how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we first need to figure out how many guests will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the guests won't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

16 (total guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed for the dinosaur picnic, we need to calculate the amount eaten by adults and children separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how much the adults will eat. Since there are 20 adults and each adult will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, the total amount eaten by adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much the children will eat. Since children eat half as much as adults, and there are 5 children, the total amount eaten by children is 5 * (10 / 2) = 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the amount eaten by adults and children to find the total amount of potato salad needed: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Cindy has 4 pets.
- Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
- Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

"To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of 40 and subtract it from 40. 
10% of 40 is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.

Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the class. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 must be girls.

Total students = 200
Boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we multiply the total number of girls by 2/3.

Girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we need to find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept. 
Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours, so the difference is 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total cars originally on the motorway = 30
- 5 cars took an exit, so the remaining cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5 = 25
- Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = cars in the first 15 minutes + cars in the remaining 15 minutes
- Cars in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

"The lovely Mary, an avid gardener with a green thumb. She's received 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery, bringing her total to a substantial number. To begin, let's calculate the initial number of potted plants she has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her country home, which gives her a total of 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

Adding the 18 new plants from the nursery, Mary now has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

However, she's feeling generous and has decided to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family. This means she'll be giving away a total of 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"

"To find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 by 3.

42 / 3 = 14

This means there are 14 sections of 3 miles each in the city. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we can multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 * 10 = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the inner volume of the boxes, we need to consider the dimensions of the boxes after accounting for the 1-inch thick walls. 

The length of each box is 5 inches, but since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

The width of each box is 6 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of each box is 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"Let's break down Frankie's TV-watching schedule. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes. That's 2 * 1 = 2 hours. 

On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours of 1-hour and 30-minute episodes. On Friday, he watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes. 

Total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 

Now, let's find the total time spent watching 30-minute episodes. We know Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the time spent watching 30-minute episodes is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

"Let's dive into the problem. Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year.
2. This year, he wants to make twice as many as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies.
3. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.
6. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.
7. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

"Let's break down the problem. We have two roll-ups with different dimensions. Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, while Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.

To find the total number of roll-ups eaten by each, we need to multiply the width by the length of each roll-up. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

Now, we need to find the average number of roll-ups eaten. To do this, we add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and divide by 2.

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of rowing in feet per second: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

Now, let's divide the total time by the rate to find the total distance rowed: 64 seconds / 1.25 feet/second = 51.2 feet.

Since we are only interested in sets of 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10: 51.2 feet / 10 = 5.12 sets.

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2: 5.12 sets * 2 liters/set = 10.24 liters.

2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sasha has leftover lumber that she bought at a certain price, and now she wants to sell it after the prices have gone up by 50%. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each, so the total cost of these boards is 10 * $10 = $100. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each, so the total cost of these boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each, and the new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards, so the total revenue from these boards is 10 * $15 = $150. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards, so the total revenue from these boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the fraction of the total mixture that is sugar. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means the total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.

The fraction of the total mixture that is sugar is 7/20. Now, we can multiply this fraction by the total amount of the mixture (120) to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar: (7/20) * 120 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount John paid for the shoes, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all 3 children. 

First, we find the cost of the shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 = $120. 

Then, we multiply this by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

The final answer is: $360"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there were initially 2 containers with 5 vehicles each at the port. This means the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we're told that the total number of vehicles at the port on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles imported on the second day by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's salary. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago was 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. To find his new salary, we need to calculate 40% of his old salary and add it to his old salary. 40% of $40000 is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. So, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of her old salary. 40% of $28000 is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. So, Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

The final answer is: $95200"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first determine how many sheets he uses in a week. Since Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week and each pad has 30 sheets of paper, we can calculate the total sheets used in a week by multiplying the number of pads by the number of sheets per pad: 2 * 30 = 60 sheets.

Next, we need to find out how many weeks are in a month. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. To find the total sheets used in a month, we multiply the number of sheets used in a week by the number of weeks in a month: 60 * 4 = 240.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael, on the other hand, brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

To find the total number of fruits Morisette brought, we add the number of apples and oranges: 5 + 8 = 13. Similarly, to find the total number of fruits Kael brought, we add the number of apples and oranges: 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, to find the total number of fruits they have in total, we add the number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought: 13 + 14 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs at two different speeds.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour:
Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jennie is helping at her mom's office. She has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and a pile of letters already stamped. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, how many were in that pile when Jennie began?

To find the initial number of letters in the already-stamped pile, we need to determine how many letters Jennie added to it. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she must have added 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters to the already-stamped pile.

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the already-stamped pile after Jennie added 20 letters. To find the initial number of letters, we subtract the number of letters Jennie added from the current total: 30 - 20 = 10.

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"The problem at hand is quite straightforward. Julia initially had an unknown number of spoons, which we'll denote as 'x'. Her husband then gave her 5 additional spoons, bringing the total to x + 5. After using 3 spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

To find the initial number of spoons Julia had, we can set up the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has. 

Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's determine the cost of each item. The cost of each pepper is given as $15. 

A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180.

Dillon buys 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers is 20 * $15 = $300.

Dillon buys 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the hospital's profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total revenue from patients.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. We multiply the number of patients by the average time per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Now, let's find the total revenue from patients. We multiply the number of patients by the hourly rate charged to the patients and then by the number of hours.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour = 2000 * $200/hour = $400000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $400000 - $30000
Profit = $370000

The final answer is: $370000"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday, so we can subtract these from the total to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday: 
41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items.
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
- Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the tip of $5.00 to the total cost with the delivery fee.
- Total cost with delivery fee and tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mark took a test with 75 questions and another test with 100 questions. He completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete it. Since he completes 5 questions per hour, he would have completed 8 * 5 = 40 questions in that time. However, he only completed 40 questions out of 75, so he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete it. At a rate of 5 questions per hour, he would have completed 6 * 5 = 30 questions in that time. However, he only completed 30 questions out of 100, so he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests: 35 + 70 = 105.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a total of 700 bees in the hive. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many babies as queens. 

Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We know that W = 2B, since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. We also know that B = 2Q, since there are twice as many babies as queens.

Now, let's use the fact that the total number of bees is 700. We can write the equation W + B + Q = 700. 

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Since B = 2Q, we have B = 2(100) = 200.

Since W = 2B, we have W = 2(200) = 400.

So, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

The final answer is: 400"
"Let's calculate how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

First, we need to determine the total hours he would work in a week. Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours more each day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

"Let's break down the costs of John's purchases. 

First, we have the food items: milk for 2 dollars and eggs for 3 dollars. The total cost of these food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

Next, we have the non-food items: light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. The total cost of these non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

However, there's a 10% tax on all non-food items. To find the tax amount, we multiply the total cost of non-food items by 0.1: 10 * 0.1 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

There are 100 pineapples per hectare. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.

Now, let's consider the bees that have left the hive so far. We have the initial 30 bees that left, and 15 of them returned. That means 30 - 15 = 15 bees have not returned yet.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.

Now, let's consider the total number of bees that have left the hive so far. We have the initial 30 bees that left, and 60 more bees left in the last 6 hours. That makes a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees. However, we know that 15 bees had not returned yet from the first 6 hours, and 60 bees left in the last 6 hours. So, the number of bees that have not returned yet is 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 15 bees return.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up an equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has ""x"". Then, Charlie has 3x friends.

We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two racers, Steve and Tim, who are competing to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives 3 miles away from the school and can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school and can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can calculate the distances as follows:

Steve's distance = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 15840 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 36 minutes

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 36
Difference in time = 4 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Shawnda's bike inflation service charges 25 cents per tire. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated. 5 people came by on bicycles, and each bicycle has 2 tires, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 bicycle tires. 3 people came by on tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tricycle tires. And 1 person came by on a unicycle, which has 1 tire. 

So, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires. 

Now, let's calculate the total cost of inflating these tires. Since each tire costs 25 cents, the total cost is 20 * 25 cents = $5.00.

Total number of cookies: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Now, we need to find the total cost of the cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie.

Total cost: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill.

Change = $10 - $6 = $4

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially. 
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 14 (by Dave) + 7 (by seagull) = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. 
   After the pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries were left. The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   We can simplify this to (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   We can solve for x by first adding 1 to both sides: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Then, multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18.
   Finally, add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape per month and then multiply it by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"

"Let's break down the situation. Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles in the pond. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out of hiding from under a lily pad, so the total number of tadpoles he can see is 11 + 6 = 17. However, 2 of these tadpoles then hide under a rock, making them invisible to Finn. To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see now, we need to subtract the 2 that hid: 17 - 2 = 15.

"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to first find the depth of the water on Tuesday. 

The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add these numbers together.

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20, and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

After 2 months, the price will be:
Price = Initial price + (Initial price * Increase percentage)
= $20 + ($20 * 0.20)
= $20 + $4
= $24

After 4 months, the price will be:
Price = $24 + ($24 * 0.20)

"Let's break down the situation. If Jackie decides to do her taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, which means she'll lose $35 per hour in missed income. To find out how much she'll lose, we multiply the number of hours by her hourly rate:

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour
= $105

Now, let's consider the cost of hiring an accountant, which is $90. To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the income she'll lose to the cost of hiring the accountant. Since the income lost is greater than the cost of hiring the accountant, Jackie will actually be better off hiring the accountant.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:
Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we denote Brooke's current age as B, then Seth's current age is 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and 2B + 2. The sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write an equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"To find out how much Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons, we need to first determine the total number of gallons they sold. 

Let's start by finding the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue per gallon is:
20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

Since they made a profit of $25, their total revenue is:
Total revenue = Profit + Cost
Total revenue = $25 + Cost

The cost per gallon is $5 ($3 for lemons and $2 for sugar), and they sell each gallon for $10. We can now set up an equation to find the number of gallons:
Number of gallons = Total revenue / $10

However, we don't know the total revenue yet. We can express the total revenue in terms of the number of gallons:
Total revenue = Number of gallons * $10

Now we have two expressions for the total revenue. We can set them equal to each other:
Number of gallons * $10 = $25 + Cost

Since the cost is $5 per gallon, the total cost is:
Total cost = Number of gallons * $5

We can substitute this expression for the total cost into the previous equation:
Number of gallons * $10 = $25 + Number of gallons * $5

Now we can solve for the number of gallons:
Number of gallons * $10 - Number of gallons * $5 = $25
Number of gallons * ($10 - $5) = $25
Number of gallons * $5 = $25
Number of gallons = $25 / $5
Number of gallons = 5

Now that we know the number of gallons, we can find the cost of lemons:
Cost of lemons = Number of gallons * $3
Cost of lemons = 5 * $3
Cost of lemons = $15

The final answer is: $15"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations and 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write the equation 5x = 200. 

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40. 
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can write an equation to represent the situation two years ago:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * Jan's age two years ago + 5
Since Jan is 30, two years ago Jan was 28. 
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * 28 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19

Now, we know Mark's age two years ago was 19. To find Mark's current age, we add 2 to this:
Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:
Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

"Let's break down the information given. We have two teams competing in a 4 by 400 meter relay. The well-rounded team has four members, each running their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. The less well-rounded team's first runner runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the total time for the well-rounded team and the less well-rounded team. The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

Now, let's calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team. Their first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The favorable outcomes for this are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 total outcomes, making the probability 3/6 or 1/2, which is equivalent to 50%.

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the die is rolled again, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Since these events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. 

50% - 25% = 25%

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we need to find half of 20. 

To find half of 20, we can divide 20 by 2. 20 / 2 = 10. So, Jenna picked 10 apples.

Now, we need to find the total number of apples they both picked. We can do this by adding the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, we need to find the number of rats in each cage.

First, let's calculate the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters. Since there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Next, we know that the rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

Now, let's find the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits. This is simply the sum of the straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits, which is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Now, let's find the number of rats in each cage. We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

The total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $100 + $2 = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $102 + $2.04 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25. 
The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, so it's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost is $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is $34."
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he collects and then multiply it by the peaches collected per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. 
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he collects for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of peaches per minute by the total minutes: 
2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects they require per week. Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply this by the number of ducks in the flock.

Total pounds of insects per week = 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Now, to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day, we divide the total pounds of insects per week by 7 (the number of days in a week).

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom starts with 50 trees. Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. So, after 10 years, Tom has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

Now, we subtract the trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"The neighbors decided to play a prank on Sue by placing 18 pink plastic flamingos on her front yard on Friday morning. Then, on Saturday, they took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put them back out. This means they took 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos, leaving 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos. After painting the 6 taken flamingos white, they were added back to the yard, making the total number of white flamingos 6.

On Sunday, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Let's calculate how much change Violetta will get after buying the crayons. 

First, we need to find out how many crayons she can buy. Since one crayon costs $2 and she has $20, we can divide the total money by the cost of one crayon.

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Now, to find out how much change she will get, we need to subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has.

Total cost of crayons = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 * $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. We can do this by multiplying the cost of a single pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed and subtract that from the initial amount.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, subtract the total pounds distributed from the initial amount:

Initial amount = 200 pounds
Total pounds distributed = 80 pounds
Pounds not used = Initial amount - Total pounds distributed = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Since Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents. The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"Let's break down John's situation. He wins an award with a $5000 monetary reward and a 5% raise in salary. His current weekly salary is $2000, and he works every week of the year.

First, we need to calculate the 5% raise:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = 100
New salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John works 52 weeks a year, we'll multiply his new salary by the number of weeks:
Total amount made that year = New salary * Number of weeks
= 2100 * 52
= 109200

However, we also need to add the $5000 monetary reward to this total:
Total amount made that year = 109200 + 5000
= 114200

The total amount John made that year is $114200."

The total number of barrels of wine produced per year is 100."
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the slices used for sandwiches. Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week, which is 7 days. He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. So, the total slices for sandwiches would be 7 * 2 = 14.

Next, let's look at the slices used for omelets. Carl made omelets for 3 days, and he used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. Therefore, the total slices for omelets would be 3 * 3 = 9.

Now, let's consider the slices used for the macaroni and cheese dish. Carl used 8 slices of cheese in it.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to add the slices used for each meal together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Since Brinley needs a total score of 558 for the semester, we need to find the score she needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

"Let's break down Michael's bike riding into two periods. In the first period, he rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks, covering a distance of 25 kilometers each time. 

To find the total distance covered in this period, we multiply the number of kilometers per ride by the number of rides per week and then by the number of weeks: 25 kilometers/ride * 5 rides/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

In the second period, Michael reduced his rides to 2 times a week but increased the distance to 60 kilometers each time. He rode like this for 3 weeks. To find the total distance covered in this period, we multiply the new number of kilometers per ride by the new number of rides per week and then by the number of weeks: 60 kilometers/ride * 2 rides/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, let's add the total kilometers for both periods to find the overall distance covered: 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to find the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples, then add them together.

The weight of each chocolate bar is given as 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

The weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

The total weight of the bag of candy is 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Now, we need to find the number of cups in twenty dozen. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

"Let's break down Sara's situation. She wants to buy a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each, totaling $70. She already has $10 saved.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids and $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we need to calculate how much more money she needs to earn.

The amount she needs to earn is $70 - $10 = $60. She earns $5 from babysitting, so let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

Now, let's find out how much she needs to earn from mowing the lawn: $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jerry has a certain number of red chickens and white chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day, Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs.

We're also given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. This means that W = R + 2.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the total number of eggs collected. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can write the equation as:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Day 1: 100 customers
- Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total by Day 3: 500 customers

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

"Let's dive into the problem. We have two pools, both leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool four minutes ago is 2x gallons.

The total amount of water leaked from both pools in four minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, let's consider the current situation. The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 gallons (since 4 gallons leaked out). The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 4 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water four minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45

"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, we know that Andy plants 90 geraniums. 
Then, we know that he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, the number of petunias is 90 - 40 = 50.

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year. 

The company spends a third of $15000 in the second year. 
A third of $15000 is $15000 / 3 = $5000.

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $15000 (first year) + $5000 (second year) = $20000.

The final answer is: $20000"
"Let's break down the costs for Carlos and Benji's rentals.

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours. To find the total cost, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours: 30 * 3 = $90.

Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours. Similarly, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours: 18 * 5 = $90.

Now, we add the costs for Carlos and Benji to find the total: $90 + $90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to consider the time it takes for each leg of the trip. 

It takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. 
It takes half as many days to travel by car, so it takes 6 / 2 = 3 days to travel by car from Rochester back to New Jersey.

The total number of days Andrew will travel is 6 (by bus) + 3 (by car) = 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. James initially has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type Pokémon cards. 

First, we need to find the total number of cards he has. 
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90

Next, James loses 8 water type cards. 
- Water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32
- Total cards = 90 - 8 = 82

Then, he buys 14 grass type cards. 
- Grass type cards = 20 + 14 = 34
- Total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

Now, we can calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
= (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.333...%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"Let's break down Chad's order step by step. The base burrito costs $6.50. He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. The total cost of the extra items is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.

The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00. Chad decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00, which includes chips and a drink. This brings the total to $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

However, Chad has a gift card for $5.00 that he uses at checkout. To find out how much he still owes, we subtract the gift card amount from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the problem. Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. So, her mom can add 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate.

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks.

First, we need to find the number of melons ready for harvest after two months. 30% of the initial 120 melons were ready, so we calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 melons.

Now, we need to find the number of melons remaining after two months. We subtract the number of melons ready for harvest from the initial total.

120 - 36 = 84 melons.

Next, we need to find the number of melons ready for harvest after two weeks. 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so we calculate 3/4 of 84.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 melons.

Finally, we need to find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks. We subtract the number of melons ready for harvest from the remaining melons.

84 - 63 = 21 melons.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fee.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars. Mark buys 12 cars, each selling for $20,000. So, the total cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the cars. Mark pays 10% tax on the cars. To find 10% of $240,000, we multiply $240,000 by 0.1, which equals $24,000.

Now, let's calculate the registration fee. Mark pays $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars, so the total registration fee is 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Finally, we add the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fee to find the total cost. $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Robert collects 20 shells on Monday. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can find out how many shells Kylie collects on Monday by adding 5 to Robert's total.

Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.

25 * 2 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to determine the number of bugs and add it to the number of ants. 

Since there were half as many bugs as ants, and there were 50 ants, we can find the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects.

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the situation. There are 36 penguins initially sunbathing in the snow. One-third of them decide to jump in the ocean, which is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. Another one-third of them go inside the cave to eat their dinner, also 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

In total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins leave the sunbathing area. To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to determine how many tomatoes Steve eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total tomatoes he eats per week: 
6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. 
So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day. 
His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week. Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find the number of vines needed: 
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and divide it by the number of slices per pizza.

First, let's find the total number of slices required. There are 20 friends, and each friend needs 4 slices. So, the total number of slices required is 20 * 4 = 80.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza, which is 8. 

80 / 8 = 10

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Ram buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low. He can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens. 

First, let's calculate how many new pens he can make from the ink of the 25 pens he buys. Since he can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens from the first 25 pens.

Now, he has 5 empty pens left. He can use the ink from these 5 pens to make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen.

So, the total number of pens he gets is 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens from the first 25 pens) + 1 (new pen from the 5 empty pens) = 31 pens.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Johnny starts with an initial allowance of $20. He then adds an extra $10 to it, bringing the total to $30. 

Now, we need to find out how much this sum of money will be after it triples in a year. To do this, we multiply the current total by 3.

$30 * 3 = $90

So, after a year, Johnny will have $90."
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Jessa is 20 years old. We also know that Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. 

Since Mary is two years younger than Joan, we can find her age by subtracting 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages. The sum is 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The final answer is: 68"

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall.

30% of the students went out through exit A:
30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.
Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.
Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280

The rest of the students went out through exit C:
280 students went out through exit C.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike has 5 pen pals initially, but he stops being pen pals with 2 of them. This leaves him with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Each of his remaining pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and since there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, after Billy took his share, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two aquariums with an equal number of fish, denoted as x. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we determine the cost for each day of makeup application. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works for 6 hours a day. So, the cost per day is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since the makeup artist needs to be done 4 times a week, the weekly cost is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost for the makeup artist is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After completing the movie, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount on the total cost. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1: 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jean paid: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"

"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister.
- Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.
- Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
- Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies
- Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
- Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
- The difference in calories consumed = 9200 - 3600 = 5600

"Let's break down the situation. Travis initially had 61 apps on his tablet. He then deleted 9 apps, which means he was left with 61 - 9 = 52 apps. After that, he downloaded 18 more apps. To find the total number of apps he has now, we need to add the apps he downloaded to the remaining apps: 52 + 18 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46.
The total number of cougars killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

"To find out how many times Anne went down the water slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 
21 * 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Sylas initially had 10 stalls with 20 cows each. This means he had a total of 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Then, he bought 40 more cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide the total number of new cows by the number of stalls:

40 / 10 = 4

So, Mr. Sylas added 4 cows to each stall. Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

24 * 8 = 192

The final answer is: 192"
"Let's calculate the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank.

First, we need to find the value of each type of coin and bill.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section.

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight.

30% of 8000 is 0.3 * 8000 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

2. Andrea has 52 apples.
3. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
5. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
6. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168.

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making. She is baking 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5. 

Since 5.5 dozens is the same as 5 dozen and 6 cookies, we need to calculate the flour needed for 6 cookies. 6 cookies is half of a dozen, so we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we need to add the flour needed for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. 5 dozen cookies need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

So, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first find two thirds of 9,300. 

Two thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.

The final answer is: 270"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Chris has 6 trees in his yard. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

So, Harry has 11 trees.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

The selling price is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

The difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to find the total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

We then subtract the total fees from the selling price to find the net selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to find the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Mico and Marco's current ages sum up to 20. To find their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages.

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as m. We know that M + m = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: (M + m) + 20. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute this into the expression to get 20 + 20 = 40.

However, we can also simplify the expression by distributing the addition: (M + 10) + (m + 10) = M + m + 10 + 10. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute this into the expression to get 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which can be expressed as R = 6S, where R is Ruby's current age and S is Sam's current age.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, which can be expressed as (R + 9) = 3(S + 9).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"To determine how much Maddy will spend on pizzas, we need to calculate the total number of people she needs to buy for. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 
The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we need to find the total length of the space between the gemstones. 

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

Now, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: 25 - 8 = 17 inches. However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: 1.75 / (1/4) = 1.75 / 0.25 = 7.

So, Katerina uses 7 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three family members: Alani, Braylen, and Margot. They each wrote a certain number of stories in the first week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. Her brother Braylen wrote 40 stories, and her sister Margot wrote 60 stories. 

To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we add the number of stories written by each of them: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. So, Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, we need to find the total number of stories written in the second week: 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week: 120 + 240 = 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years, we first need to determine his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his age by multiplying Ann's age by 2.

Ann's age is 9 years, so her brother's age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

In 3 years, her brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's break down Kelly's initial amount. She has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 
Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

The total amount Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount she has. 

145 - 55 = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to determine the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to find the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so we multiply the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone:

80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks, which is 2000 pounds per truck:

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, and the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, the car in the slow lane is traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Given that the car in the fast lane (and the car in the slow lane) traveled 480 miles, we can calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane as follows:
time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, so the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let x be the total number of medals given out. Then, 10x = 39 (since Ali and Izzy have 39 medals together).

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

The total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. There are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get: 16 / 8 = 2.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Susan's earnings for the online task. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break in between, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

To find out how much she earns, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the points of the three friends after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 21 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Will buys 15 oranges and asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges. So, 15 - 12 = 3 oranges are left unwashed.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down Darren's workout routine over two days. On the first day, he does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

On the second day, he increases his pushups by 20, decreases his squats by 10, and doubles his dumbbell presses.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Total for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

The total count of activities in two days is 170 + 200 = 370."
"To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household with 5 members who eat rice every lunch and dinner, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down Sam's sales for the week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so we'll ignore those days. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates.

To find the total number of crates sold, we add these amounts together: 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

Now, let's compare this to his target of 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total number of crates sold from the target: 120 - 65 = 55.

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the number of bids made by the other 3 people and Carmen, and then calculate the total amount bid.

Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, there are 3 bids made by the other people. After each of these bids, Carmen also bids, so there are 3 bids made by Carmen. In total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 bids.

The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. The total amount bid is the sum of an arithmetic series with the first term a = 200, the common difference d = 50, and the number of terms n = 6.

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d)

Plugging in the values, we get:
S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

The final answer is: $1950"
"To calculate the total cost John pays for driving, we need to consider the total miles driven, the driving cost, and the bonus he gives his driver.

First, let's find the total miles driven. Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 

Next, we calculate the total miles driven per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. Then, we find the total miles driven per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Now, let's calculate the total driving cost. John is charged $2 per mile driven. So, the total driving cost per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

In addition to the driving cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus per year, we multiply this by 12: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Finally, we add the total driving cost and the total bonus to find the total cost per year: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, let's consider how the pages are arranged after folding.

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper.

For a 32-page tabloid, we can consider the following arrangement:

- The first page (page 1) is on the left back.
- The second page (page 2) is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back.
- The 31st page is on the right front.

This pattern continues until we reach the middle of the paper, where the 16th page is on the left back and the 15th page is on the left front.

After the middle, the pattern reverses, with the 17th page on the right back and the 16th page on right front.

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, we need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages (left and right sides) and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages (left and right sides).

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 (for the first 16 pages) + 2 (for the last 16 pages) = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down Annika's expenses at the town fair. She initially had $50. 

She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.

Annika also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at $20, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45.

To find the total amount of money she earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the second year. We can do this by subtracting the number of unsold books, the number of books sold this year, and the number of books sold in the first year from the total number of books.

Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To determine how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to find 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight in the same amount of time as Joey, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds by 4. 

The number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds is 4. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we multiply 4 by 4: 4 * 4 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a serum that causes a person to grow extra limbs at specific intervals. 

First, we need to find out how many extra arms the person will grow. Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we divide the total number of days (15) by 3 to find out how many times this happens. 15 / 3 = 5. So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

Next, we need to find out how many extra legs the person will grow. Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, we divide the total number of days (15) by 5 to find out how many times this happens. 15 / 5 = 3. So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

Now, we add the number of extra arms and legs together to find the total number of new limbs. 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down Theo's expenses for his business trip to South Africa.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the business suits. He buys 6 suits at $100 each, so the total cost of the suits is 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases. He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so the total cost of the suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

To find the total cost so far, we add the cost of the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Now, let's calculate how much he has left after buying these items. He started with $6000, so he has $6000 - $1950 = $4050 left.

Since he wants to save $2000, we subtract this from his remaining budget: $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

This means he has $2050 left over, which he can spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a family of 5, and three of them eat 3 eggs each day, while the rest eat 2 eggs each day.

First, let's find out how many eggs the three people who eat 3 eggs each day consume in a day. That's 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs the rest of the family members consume in a day. There are 5 - 3 = 2 family members who eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a day, we add the eggs consumed by both groups: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to multiply the daily consumption by 7 to find the total number of eggs consumed in a week: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. To find Jane's age, we subtract 3 from Quinn's age: 30 - 3 = 27.

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we add 5 to Jane's age: 27 + 5 = 32.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Noah's current age. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old. Since then, Noah has aged 6 years, so his current age is 20 + 6 = 26 years.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old at that time, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total number of players on the football team is 105. We also know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, and half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. Then, the number of players on the offense is 2D, and the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each.

First, we need to find the total number of people invited. 
2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

Now, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. 
24 - 8 = 16 people

However, 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
So, 2 people had previous commitments and couldn't come.

Now, subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited.
16 - 2 = 14 people

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find out how many people left, we need to calculate 1/4 of 40, which is 40 * 1/4 = 10.

Since 10 people left, the number of people remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were 25 men initially, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 (because 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men).

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider the weakening caused by both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's determine the weakening caused by the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and we want to cool it down by 65 degrees. 

The temperature difference is 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. So, the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since 5 ice cubes are added, the coffee becomes 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes.

Next, we need to consider the weakening caused by the cream. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that 5 people came in with old records and left with 7 new records. Since they trade 2 old records for 1 new record, we need to find out how many old records they brought in.

Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the number of old records traded is twice the number of new records. 

Number of new records = 7
Number of old records traded = 2 * Number of new records
Number of old records traded = 2 * 7
Number of old records traded = 14

Since there are 5 people, and they all brought in the same number of old records, we can divide the total number of old records traded by 5 to find out how many old records each person brought in.

Number of old records per person = Number of old records traded / Number of people
Number of old records per person = 14 / 5
Number of old records per person = 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records.

Total number of old records = Number of old records per person * Number of people
Total number of old records = 2.8 * 5
Total number of old records = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of junior programmers. We know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. The total number of employees is 100, so we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100
= 2 * 20
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is the remaining employees:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers. Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so we can calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers as follows:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Next, we need to find the salary of senior programmers. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is:

Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Finally, we can find the total amount paid to all programmers by adding the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Before that, 8 people got in at the second bus stop. So, at the second bus stop, there were 20 - 8 = 12 people on the bus.

Now, we need to find out how many people were on the bus before the second bus stop. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off, so before that, there were 12 + 7 = 19 people on the bus.

We know that at the first bus stop, 5 people got in. So, before the first bus stop, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's break down Oscar's lollipop adventure step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. On his way to school, he eats 2, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes 14 out to his friends, which brings his total down to 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

After school, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Adding these to his existing stash, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, Oscar eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, bringing his total down to 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we first need to determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to charge 40%, we multiply 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

Now, we need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 120 by 60.

120 / 60 = 2 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so we add 10 to 7. 

7 + 10 = 17

"To find out how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then subtract the total from the amount spent on the current shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on the last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On the current shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The amount the customer paid is $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's break down the information given for the two job options.

For Job A, we know the hourly wage is $15 and the total hours worked per year is 2000. To find the total income, we multiply the hourly wage by the total hours worked: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year.

Next, we need to calculate the income tax for Job A. The state has a 20% total tax rate, so we multiply the total income by the tax rate: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. Subtracting the income tax from the total income gives us the net income for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, we know the total annual income is $42,000. However, there's a property tax of $6,000 and a 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax. First, we subtract the property tax from the total income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Then, we calculate the income tax by multiplying the net income by the tax rate: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. Subtracting the income tax from the net income gives us the final net income for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, let's compare the net incomes of the two jobs to find the difference. We subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"

"Let's break down the two offers from Furniture United and Cozy Homes to determine the cost difference.

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment. The total amount paid in installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment. The total amount paid in installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers. Subtracting the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from Furniture United's offer, we get $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each. The stock price increases by 50% in the first year, and then decreases by 25% in the second year.

First, we need to find the price of the shares after the first year. To do this, we'll calculate the 50% increase in the initial price of $8. The increase is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4. So, the price of each share after the first year is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, we'll find the price of the shares after the second year. The stock price decreases by 25% from the price after the first year, which is $12. The decrease is 25% of $12, which is 0.25 * $12 = $3. Therefore, the price of each share after the second year is $12 - $3 = $9.

Now, we can find the total value of all Maria's shares. She has 8 shares, and each share is worth $9 after the second year. So, the total value of all shares is 8 * $9 = $72.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a class of 200 students that's split into 3 groups. Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two.

Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. So, we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x: 
70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals on his farm, and they are all either chickens or cows. We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, we can express this as H = 2C.

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation H + C = 60.

Substituting H = 2C into the second equation, we get 2C + C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Now that we know C = 20, we can find the value of H by substituting C into the equation H = 2C, which gives us H = 2 * 20 = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

"Josh decides to take up juggling to perform at the school talent show a month in the future. He starts off practicing juggling 3 balls, and slowly gets better adding 1 ball to his juggling act each week. After the end of the fourth week, the talent show begins, but when Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops three of his balls. 2 of them are caught by people in the crowd as they roll off the stage, but one gets lost completely since the auditorium is dark.

To find out how many balls Josh has left, we need to calculate the total number of balls he had initially and then subtract the number of balls he lost. Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, he has 3 + 4 = 7 balls.

When he drops 3 balls, 2 are caught, so 1 ball is lost.

So, Josh starts juggling with 7 balls and loses 1, leaving him with 7 - 1 = 6 balls.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that a pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, a green toad, and that the yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog. Additionally, the red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can determine the weights of the other animals as follows:

- The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of the animals and the container, which weighs 20 pounds:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds

"Let's break down John's activities to find out how much time he spent sightseeing.

First, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity. John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. He also watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We know that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. If 30% of the total time is 6 hours, we can find the total time by dividing 6 by 0.30. This gives us 6 / 0.30 = 20 hours.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying 0.40 by the total time: 0.40 * 20 = 8 hours.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. 

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

"Let's break down Marisa's daily expenses and savings. She gets $5 as pocket money every day and buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. 

First, we need to convert the cost of lollipops from cents to dollars. 
25 cents = $0.25
So, 4 lollipops cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day.
Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days.
Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Billy starts with $10 and buys candy at $1.5 per pound. After buying the candy, he takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs that cost $0.05 each. He buys 40 gumballs.

First, let's find out how much money Billy had left after buying the candy. If he spent x pounds of candy, the total cost of the candy is 1.5x. So, the amount of money he had left is 10 - 1.5x.

He then takes half of this amount and spends it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Carver's age is 45, and it's 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can represent his son's age as 'x'. 

The relationship between Carver's age and his son's age can be expressed as:
Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:
45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':
50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

"To find the distance from the third city to the first city, we need to add the distances from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city, then subtract 50 miles. 

Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Combined distance: 75 + 100 = 175 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance traveled in one trip. 
Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 125 miles
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is:
Total distance in one trip: 300 miles
Total trips in a day: 3
Total distance in a day: 300 * 3 = 900 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we need to divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day.
Total distance between services: 18,000 miles
Total distance in a day: 900 miles
Number of days between services: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2. 
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 
Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the total distance John drove to his friend's house, we need to add the detour to the original distance. The detour added 10 miles to the 200-mile trip, making the total distance 210 miles.

The time taken to drive to his friend's house is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed. In this case, the speed is 70 mph. So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

For the return trip, John drove 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph. To find the time taken for the return trip, we divide the distance by the speed: 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

The total time taken for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house and the time taken to drive back home. Therefore, the total time taken for the trip is 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to consider the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to consider the cost of etching the logo on each frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost, which is 20% of $20, or $4 per frame. Therefore, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching to get the total cost of the picture frames and etching: $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each, so the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Lastly, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 11 seniors. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. Therefore, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

To find the total cost of all the gifts, we add the cost of the picture frames and etching, the cost of the pins, and the cost of the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"To find the total number of shoes sold, let's break it down step by step.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double that number of shoes, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls. After feeding her 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Now, she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces. To find out how many pieces she had in total, we multiply the number of rolls left by the number of pieces per roll: 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we need to first find the number of pupils who like blue and green, and then subtract that from the total number of pupils.

Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5.

The total number of pupils who like blue and green is 20 + 5 = 25.

The number of pupils who like yellow is 40 - 25 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples picked, and she got $56 from selling them at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is:
$56 / $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we add the number of apples picked on each day to find the total:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The final answer is: 50"
"The mystery of the missing socks. Lindsay is doing the laundry, and she's concerned that some socks have gone astray. There are 50 socks that need washing. If she washes 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks, how many socks has Lindsay missed?

Let's break it down. 10 pairs of socks is equal to 10 x 2 = 20 socks. Adding the 15 loose socks, Lindsay has washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, to find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she's washed from the total number of socks. That's 50 - 35 = 15.

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Let's break down the situation. Rachel initially bought 23 cookies. Then, Janet gave her 42 cookies. To find the total number of cookies Rachel has, we need to add these two numbers together.

23 (initial cookies) + 42 (cookies from Janet) = 65

Now, Rachel's brother ate 44 cookies. To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies her brother ate from the total number of cookies.

65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten by brother) = 21

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel."
"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest and then divide it by the number of months.

The total interest is calculated as: Principal * Rate * Time
Principal = $3,650
Rate = 10% or 0.10
Time = 5 months

Total interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5 = $1,825

The total amount to be paid is the principal + interest = $3,650 + $1,825 = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
$5,475 / 5 = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how far Cho hiked and how far Chloe hiked, and then determine the difference between their distances.

Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance Cho hiked, we multiply the speed by the time: 14 kilometers/hour * 8 hours = 112 kilometers.

Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance Chloe hiked, we multiply the speed by the time: 9 kilometers/hour * 5 hours = 45 kilometers.

Now, we need to find the difference between Cho's distance and Chloe's distance. To do this, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance: 112 kilometers - 45 kilometers = 67 kilometers.

The final answer is: 67"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as he does, which means she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. Additionally, Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together: 50 (Axel's silver pesos) + 100 (Anna's silver pesos) = 150 silver pesos.

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together: 80 (Axel's gold pesos) + 120 (Anna's gold pesos) = 200 gold pesos.

To find the total number of pesos they have together, we add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos: 150 + 200 = 350.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, she can make a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. So, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to sell all the lemonade. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cups by the cups sold per hour: 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how many people sang in the performance, we first need to determine the number of girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls.

However, on the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. This means that half of the girls can't make it, so we need to find half of 26, which is 26 / 2 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with the remaining girls. To find the total number of people performing, we add the number of girls who made it to the show (26 - 13 = 13) to the number of teachers (3). So, the total number of people performing is 13 + 3 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu. 

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out the cost of the rides for Dasha. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides, the total cost for her is 9 * $4 = $36.

Now, let's look at David's option. He buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. This means he doesn't need to buy any additional tickets.

Since they both ride all 9 rides, the cost for Dasha is $36 and the cost for David is $30.

The amount of money David saves is $36 - $30 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we need to first determine the number of popsicles each of them has. We know that the ratio of their popsicles is 5:6 and the total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

To find the number of popsicles each person has, we divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the ratio parts (5+6=11) and then multiply by the respective ratio parts.

Betty's popsicles = (5/11) * 165 = 75
Sam's popsicles = (6/11) * 165 = 90

Now, let's find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty:
Difference = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15

"Let's break down the cost of the streaming services. Tim gets Netflix for $10 a month. 

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% for bundling. To find the bundled cost, we need to calculate 20% of $20 (the normal cost of both services). 

20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we first need to calculate the total time she spent working on the song. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of time spent editing by dividing the time spent editing by the total time and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

"To determine how many bags of flour Mark needs to buy, we need to divide the total amount of flour required by the amount of flour in each bag. 

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour for a single batch, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, so the total flour required is 4 * 3 cups = 12 cups. Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so we divide the total flour required by the amount in each bag: 12 / 2 = 6.

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to divide the total amount of milk required by the amount of milk in each bottle. The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk for a single batch, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, so the total milk required is 4 * 1 cup = 4 cups. Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so we divide the total milk required by the amount in each bottle: 4 / 2 = 2.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis, and he initially has 40 cannolis. This means he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Now, Allan buys 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 fewer corns than that, which is 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

To find the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has now, we add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis he bought: 
Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 20
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

"Let's break down Elliott's steps. He finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. Half of 10,000 is 5,000 steps. 

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and it averages 200 words per page, we can calculate the total number of words in the book as follows:

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Now, we can find the time it will take Toby to read the book by dividing the total number of words by his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

Time to read the book = Total words / reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Next, we need to add the time it takes to get to the airport, which is 10 minutes. So, the total time Toby will be at the airport is:

Total time = Time to read the book + Time to get to the airport = 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we can find out how many minutes early he will be by subtracting the total time from the time he has to be there:

Time early = Time to be at the airport - Total time = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that in May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each of them $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. To find the total amount paid to each employee in May, we need to calculate the total hours worked by each employee and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Since each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400.

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid to all employees in May. Since there are 40 employees, the total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400.

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid to all employees in June. Since there are 30 employees, the total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to add the total amount paid in May and June. The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"The fourth of July is just around the corner, and I'm excited to light off some fireworks. I've got a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much, which is $800. So, the total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

However, I'm lucky to get a 20% discount on them. To calculate the discount, I'll multiply the total cost by 0.2, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240. Now, I'll subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted price: $1200 - $240 = $960.

I also need to buy a finale firework that costs $150. To find the total amount spent, I'll add the discounted cost of the fireworks to the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the conditions given. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

However, we're only interested in the candles that are more dangerous and have a 99% guarantee not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles are more dangerous and can explode. The number of candles that are more dangerous is 0.01 * 50000 = 500.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, we can find this by multiplying 0.05 by the number of more dangerous candles: 0.05 * 500 = 25.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's call the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"The problem at hand is quite intriguing. We have a herd consisting of camels and dromedaries, with a total of 180 heads and 304 bumps. Camels, being the majestic creatures they are, have two humps each, while dromedaries have a single hump. 

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We can start by setting up two equations based on the given information. The first equation accounts for the total number of heads:

C + D = 180

The second equation takes into account the total number of bumps, considering the hump count for each type of animal:

2C + D = 304

Now, let's solve this system of equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation will allow us to eliminate D and find the value of C:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

With the number of camels determined, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, the number of dromedaries in the herd is 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"Let's break down Tom's two-week-long trip through Europe. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

In the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is (30/100) * 800 km = 240 km. So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

In the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches (Zack's locker size)

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. To find Timothy's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2.

2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches (Timothy's locker size)

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb is, we need to determine the point where it landed after falling from his initial position. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.
2. The first bank gave him $4000.
3. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.
4. So, the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.
5. To find the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. To find the total number of cats taken away, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat carried: 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods and calculate the cost for each period.

First, let's calculate the cost for the introductory period of 6 months at $8 a month:
6 months * $8/month = $48

Next, we'll calculate the cost for the 8 months at the normal rate of $12 a month:
8 months * $12/month = $96

Then, we'll calculate the cost for the remaining months at the increased rate of $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, we subtract the first 6 months and the next 8 months to find the remaining months:
24 months - 6 months - 8 months = 10 months
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

Next, we're told that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Now, let's substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we get: 3T - 6 = 18.

Adding 6 to both sides, we get: 3T = 24.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others. We know that each bird feeder attracts 20 birds throughout the day. However, the homemade feeders seem to attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones.

Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can calculate the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as 20. The homemade feeders, therefore, attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders: 3 * 30 = 90.

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders: 3 * 20 = 60.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted to the homemade and store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5.
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he needs to make $50 from selling the cards. 

Since each card is sold for $1.5, we can calculate the number of cards he sold by dividing the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5 = 33.33 (round down to 33 since you can't sell a fraction of a card)

However, Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. 

Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.33

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to determine how many hotdogs were prepared. The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests were prepared for to have two hotdogs. This means 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests. 

However, the caterer prepared enough for the other half of the guests (also 18) to have one hotdog each. So, 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests. 

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were needed. 

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. This means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 6 + 7 = 13.

"Let's break down Charlotte's order to find the total cost. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The items are 20% off, so we multiply the total cost by 0.20 to find the discount amount: 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte needs to pay: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"

"The tale of the brave princes and their dragon-slaying exploits is a fascinating one. Let's break it down step by step.

Prince Thaddeus, with his mighty sword, slew 100 dragons. Prince Arthur, wielding a spear, managed to slay three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. To find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew, we need to calculate three quarters of 100, which is 75.

Now, Prince Walter, armed with a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Since Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons, Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Lastly, Prince Bruce, who forgot his sword at home, used a nail file to slay one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to divide 150 by 5, which equals 30.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. 

1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons

Now we convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 0.75 by 8.

0.75 * 8 = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. 
2. Since 1% of his money is equal to $0.01, 99% of his money is equal to $5 - $0.01 = $4.99.
3. The cost of 3 bags of chips is 3 * 40 cents = $1.20.
4. The amount of money George spent on chips is $1.20.
5. The amount of money George spent on candy bars is $4.99 - $1.20 = $3.79.
6. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars George bought is $3.79 / 0.75 = 5.0533. 
   Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Ray had 25 lollipops initially. He decided to keep 5 for himself, so we need to find out how many lollipops he had left to share.

25 (initial lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept) = 20 lollipops left to share.

Now, we know Ray has 4 friends and he wants to share the remaining lollipops equally among them. To find out how many lollipops each friend will get, we divide the total lollipops left by the number of friends.

20 lollipops / 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend.

So, each of Ray's friends will receive 5 lollipops.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rory makes a cake that weighs 20 ounces and cuts it into 8 equal pieces. Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find the weight of the remaining cake.

First, we need to find the weight of each piece. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, the total weight of the cake they ate is equal to 2 times the weight of each piece.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is: 15"

Now, they want to share these oranges with their 6 other friends, making a total of 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends) sharing the oranges.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:
56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's. So, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time difference between their arrival times.

If Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, and she needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.

However, since we want to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to subtract the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater from the time Bernadette needs to leave. So, Bernadette should leave 21 - 4 = 17 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how many beads each sister has and then determine the difference between their total bead counts.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has

"To find out how long it took James to complete the triathlon, we need to first determine his total time. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.

First, let's convert Jon's times into minutes: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to swim and bike. 
- James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's, so it is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes.
- James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to run. 
Total time for James: 180 minutes
Time for James to swim and bike: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:

"Let's break down the information given:

You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?

Let's analyze the situation: If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If you buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can set up the equation 20x = 900. 

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45. 

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. 

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65. 

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. Multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11050.

Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. 

First, we need to find out how many sapphires she has left. To do this, we subtract the number of sapphires she traded from the total number of sapphires she had initially: 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires.

Next, we need to find the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, we multiply the number of sapphires she has left by the value of each sapphire: 5 * $800 = $4000.

Now, we need to find the value of the rubies she received. Since each ruby is worth $1200, we multiply the number of rubies she received by the value of each ruby: 2 * $1200 = $2400.

Finally, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of her jewels: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"Let's calculate the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days. 

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. To find the total number of apples they eat per day, we add their individual amounts together: 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30:
8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one bed is length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to find the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"Let's break down the situation. Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest. After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined the group.

So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 

To find the number of fairies remaining, we subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total number of fairies: 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of the feed. 

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 pounds. 

Next, he buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

The farmer also buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

Lastly, he buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we add up the weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity: 3400 / 2250 = 1.511.

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Grayson's recycling earnings. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. 

Aluminum cans are worth two cents each, so three cans are worth 3 * 2 = 6 cents. 

Plastic bottles are worth three cents each, so five bottles are worth 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

To find her weekly earnings, we add the value of the cans and bottles: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

Since there are four weeks in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Frederick has 10 plants. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:
Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the situation. Leila gave Ali half of her $100. To find out how much she gave him, we need to divide $100 by 2.

$100 / 2 = $50

So, Leila gave Ali $50. Now, we need to add this amount to the $21 Ali already had.

$21 + $50 = $71

Therefore, Ali now has $71.

The final answer is: $71"
"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate 1/5 of the cost of the pizza and add it to the cost of the pizza.

The cost of the pizza is $15. To find 1/5 of this amount, we multiply $15 by 1/5.

1/5 of $15 = (1/5) * $15
1/5 of $15 = $3

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man.

Total amount = Cost of the pizza + Tip
Total amount = $15 + $3
Total amount = $18

The final answer is: $18"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Miss Maria has six decks of basketball cards, each containing 25 cards. To find the total number of basketball cards, we multiply the number of decks by the number of cards in each deck: 6 * 25 = 150.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of baseball cards. Miss Maria has five boxes of baseball cards, with 40 cards in each box. We multiply the number of boxes by the number of cards in each box: 5 * 40 = 200.

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards to find the overall number of cards: 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, we subtract this number from the total to find out how many cards she gives to her students: 350 - 50 = 300.

Finally, we divide the number of cards given to the students by the number of cards each student receives to find the number of students: 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount. 

Becky's cost per apple is 45 cents. She bought 20 apples, so the total cost is 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents. Since she received a $1 discount, which is 100 cents, we subtract this from the total cost: 900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 800 cents / 100 = $8.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount. Kelly's cost per apple is 50 cents. She bought 20 apples, so the total cost is 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents. Since she received a 10% discount, we calculate 10% of 1000 cents, which is 0.1 * 1000 cents = 100 cents. We subtract this from the total cost: 1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 900 cents / 100 = $9.

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. We subtract Becky's total cost from Kelly's total cost: $9 - $8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is equivalent to 5 * 2 = 10 shoes. 

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes. 

On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs: 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

However, on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. To find the total number of shoes he has on Sunday, we need to subtract 180 from 300: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to figure out how many cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, she can decorate 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide 48 by 12 to get the number of pans.

48 / 12 = 4

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the cost of the paper, we need to calculate three times the price of the pen and then subtract $1 from it.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of pencils initially in the class. There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils. 
Total pencils initially = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

Next, 1/5 of the total pencils were used after two months. 
Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils

Now, we need to find the remaining pencils after two months. 
Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. 
Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils

"Let's break down the problem. Matt's dad tells him he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can express this as an equation:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

We want to find the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat, which is represented by 'x'. To do this, we need to solve the equation for 'x'. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies."
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

"Let's break down the problem. We're told that three-fourths of the students at a certain grade level have a desktop computer at home. This means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We're given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, which is equal to one-fourth of the total number of students.

We can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to isolate x:
x = 20 * 4
x = 80

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sarah spent $300 on books, and each book costs $15. To find out how many books she bought, we need to divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Now that we know Sarah bought 20 books, we need to find out how many books each of her 4 kids will get. Since she's giving an equal number of books to each child, we'll divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to consider the total number of kids in the class and the number of kids allergic to dairy, peanuts, or both.

First, let's add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts, then subtract the number allergic to both to avoid double-counting. This is based on the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Number of kids allergic to dairy: 9
Number of kids allergic to peanuts: 6
Number of kids allergic to both: 3

Total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts: 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything:
32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic kids) = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and add the number of tour guides.

There are 3 groups of 200 employees, so the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Each group has 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups, so the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

The total number of people going on the tour is 600 (employees) + 21 (tour guides) = 621.

"The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000. 

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the new price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price. 20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. So, the new price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"Let's break down the information given. Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, which means Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper also has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes together: 2 + 9 = 11.

"To find out how much more Keegan and Tasha need to earn, we need to subtract the total amount they have already earned from their goal.

First, let's add up the amount Keegan and Tasha have earned so far. Keegan earned $83 and Tasha earned $91, so together they have $83 + $91 = $174.

Now, we need to subtract this amount from their goal of $200 to find out how much more they need to earn. $200 - $174 = $26.

So, Keegan and Tasha need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

"I've been watching Stetson eat oranges all day, and I'm starting to get a little worried about my bet. We picked 60 oranges in total, and I know Stetson ate 2/5 of them. To figure out how much I'm going to have to pay him, I need to find out how many oranges he ate.

To do that, I'll multiply 2/5 by 60. 

2/5 of 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 oranges.

Now that I know Stetson ate 24 oranges, I need to multiply that by the amount I owe him per orange, which is $10.

24 oranges * $10/orange = $240.

I guess I'm going to have to pay Stetson $240."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first determine how many miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. 
So, miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles run in a week by his speed.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Uncle Ben has four horses, and each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal. Since he feeds his horses twice a day, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Now, we need to find the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in a day. This is simply 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5. So, 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats are needed for five days.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats needed by the weight of one bag to find the number of bags required. This gives us 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 saved. To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first.

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount.

Daily savings = $2
Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount."
"Let's break down the problem. Jaime has 2 trays, and each tray can hold 24 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs that can fit on the trays.

The total number of eggs that can fit on the trays is 24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs.

Jaime has 64 eggs, and 48 eggs can fit on the trays. To find the number of eggs that won't fit, we subtract the number of eggs that can fit from the total number of eggs:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, let's break it down step by step.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but since they are buy one get one free, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00.

She also has a $2.00 coupon, which she can use to get a discount.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how old Brett will be in four years. Since he's currently 14 years old, we add 4 to that: 14 + 4 = 18.

Now, we know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, we multiply Brett's current age by 3: 14 * 3 = 42.

Since Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we need to subtract 4 from that to find her current age: 42 - 4 = 38.

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old."

"Let's break down the problem. Mark is considering two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, while the second charges $25 per person who attends. However, the first venue doesn't include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends. On the other hand, the second venue includes food in the price.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). The cost of the second venue is $25x (per person charge).

We can set up the equation: 200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides: 200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20: 10 = x

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We can express the number of insects Lily found as B/2 + 7, since she found 7 more than David.

The total number of insects they collected is the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi, which is 43. We can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. 
So, the rug's width = chair's width + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. 
Twice the width of the rug = 2 * 8 = 16 feet.
The couch is 2 feet longer than this, so the couch's length = 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"Let's break down the information given: Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She got 2 packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, we need to find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost.

Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

Since the total cost is $7, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out which type of wood gives the most popsicle sticks per dollar. 

A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and gives 200 sticks, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50.
A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and gives 400 sticks, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67 (round down to 66.67 since we can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood).

Since 66.67 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood I can buy with my $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first find the total number of snowshoes needed. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"Let's break down Janet's bus expenses. She takes two bus trips five days a week, which means she takes a total of 10 bus trips in a week. Each bus trip costs her $2.20.

To find out her weekly bus expenses, we multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of trips she takes in a week.

Cost of one bus trip: $2.20
Number of trips in a week: 10

Total weekly cost of bus trips: $2.20 * 10 = $22.00

Now, let's compare this to the cost of a weekly bus pass, which is $20. 

Weekly bus pass cost: $20
Weekly bus trip cost: $22.00

By buying a weekly bus pass, Janet would save $2.00.

2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals: 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

However, this equation is not necessary to solve the problem. We can simply use the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. This means that the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 1/4 of the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.

The total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. To find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can divide this total by 4:
16 / 4 = 4

So, Sophia bought 4 onions and potatoes in total.

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the number of days he has to lose the weight. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days:

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know that the house cost three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the canvas bags. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. To find the total number of bags, we multiply the number of packs by the number of bags in each pack: 8 * 5 = 40 bags. 

Now, we multiply the total number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost: 40 bags * $4 = $160.

Next, we need to find the total revenue. Tara sold each bag for $8, so we multiply the total number of bags by the selling price: 40 bags * $8 = $320.

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight in minutes and multiply it by the average number of punches he throws per minute.

The fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Suzanne made 36 cookies. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can find out how many cookies Josh made by dividing 36 by 4.

36 / 4 = 9

So, Josh made 9 cookies. Now, we need to find out how many cookies Kelsie made. We know Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find this out, we multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 

Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

Next, Ali gives his sister half of the total money. Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of the remaining money, we multiply $80 by 3/5.
3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) * $80 = $48
Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

The final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. To find out how long it takes him in minutes, we need to convert 2 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Now, we're told that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. To find out how long Royce takes, we need to calculate double the time it takes Rob and then add 40 minutes. Double the time it takes Rob is 2 * 120 = 240 minutes. Adding 40 minutes to that gives us 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total for each item and then add them together.

For the hats, Martha needs 3 children * 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins.
For the scarves, she needs 3 children * 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins.
For the sweaters, she needs 3 children * 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins.
For the mittens, she needs 3 children * 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins.
For the socks, she needs 3 children * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins.

Now, let's add the total number of skeins needed for each item:
6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins

The final answer is: 63"
"Let's break down Chris's math homework progress. He has a total of 100 math problems to complete.

On Monday night, Chris completes 12 problems. 

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of problems Chris has to complete is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

The number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 100 - 61 = 39.

The final answer is: 39"
"Let's break down the strawberry-picking abilities of Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. 
Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

"To find the number of loaves of bread left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves baked.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold. The bakers sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. So, the total number of loaves sold is 93 + 39 = 132.

Now, we need to subtract the total number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves baked. The bakers baked 200 loaves and returned 6 loaves. So, the number of loaves left is 200 - 132 - 6 = 62.

The number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. 

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be used for the granola and snack mix. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. So, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

Daily consumption before adding the device is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Weekly consumption before adding the device is 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour.
Cost before adding the device is 84 * $1.50 = $126.

Daily consumption after adding the device is 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.
Weekly consumption after adding the device is 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour.
Cost after adding the device is 98 * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

"To determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to first figure out how many days it would take for them to complete the task.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, as their combined work rate is five times faster. 

Since 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days, as 2 halves make a whole.

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for a total of $48. To find out how many more CDs he could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to first determine how much money he spent on the headphone set.

The total money spent is $48, and the money spent on the CD is $4. So, the money spent on the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. The cost of one CD is $4, so the number of CDs that could have been bought is $44 / $4 = 11.

If Tom had spent the $44 on CDs instead of the headphone set, he would have bought 11 CDs. However, he actually bought 1 CD, so he could have bought 11 - 1 = 10 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours, the weeks where he spent 5 hours, and the week where he spent 6 hours.

For the weeks where he spent 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (since 8 - 2 = 6). 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week where he spent 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add up the total hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Now, let's find out how many passengers get on at the second stop. It's mentioned that 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times the number of passengers who got off (21) fewer passengers get on. 3 times 21 is 63, so 63 fewer passengers get on. However, since we are looking for the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. So, 21 - 63 = -42. Since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that 63 more passengers got on.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122.

The final answer is: 122"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age:
   Difference = Jame's current age - cousin's current age
             = 22 - 47
             = -25

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference:
   Difference = | -25 |
             = 25

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer = $2,400
2. Cost of the computer = $1,100
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, we need to find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there are 20 kids in total, and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys went out for the scavenger hunt and brought back 60 shells each. To find the total number of seashells brought by the boys, we multiply the number of boys by the number of shells each brought: 10 * 60 = 600.

Now, we need to find the number of seashells brought by the girls. The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 (the number of shells brought by the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times the number of shells brought by the boys) seashells.

First, we calculate four times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add the number of shells brought by the boys to this result: 60 + 240 = 300.

So, the girls brought 300 more seashells than the boys. To find the total number of seashells brought by the girls, we add this to the total number of seashells brought by the boys: 600 + 300 = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls to find the number of seashells brought by each girl: 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"

3. George ate 5 candies, so he has x - 5 candies left.
4. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so x - 5 = 3.
5. Solving for x, we get x = 8.
6. Since Nick had 2x candies initially, Nick has 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

"To find Anne's age, we need to find Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we subtract 4 from Chenny's age to get Alyana's age.

Chenny is 10 years old, so Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6.

Now, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we add 2 to Alyana's age to get Anne's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 = 81
81 + 45 = 126
126 + 62 = 188

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to get his initial share. $18 / 3 = $6.

Next, he added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

Then, he added another $10, bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21.

However, he needed some money and spent $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we need to determine the amount he saves each day in the first half and then double it.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. The number of days in the second half will also be x, as April has 30 days.

Let's denote the amount saved in the first half as y. Then, the amount saved in the second half will be 2y.

The total amount saved in the first half is xy, and the total amount saved in the second half is 2xy.

The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation: 3xy = 1125.

Since x is the number of days in the first half, and the total number of days in April is 30, we can write x + x = 30, which simplifies to 2x = 30, and x = 15.

Now we can substitute x = 15 into the equation 3xy = 1125 to find y: 3(15)y = 1125, which simplifies to 45y = 1125.

To find y, we divide both sides by 45: y = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

"Let's break down the problem. Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars between them, and Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of what Jeff and Brad get is 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters from the first two times, and the 13 letters from the third time. So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. So, the total number of letters she has written is 65 + 65 = 130.

For the sales over $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission. Since she sold goods worth $2500, the sales over $1000 are $2500 - $1000 = $1500. The additional commission for this amount is 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Now, we add the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the sales over $1000 to get the total commission: $300 + $150 = $450.

The total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"To figure out how many water bottles Bill needs to buy for his party, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he requires. 

Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles in each case, so he has a total of 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

He wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, so he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles for his guests.

In total, Bill needs 140 (for guests) + 48 (he already has) = 188 bottles.

Since Bill already has 48 bottles, he needs to buy 188 - 48 = 140 additional bottles.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how long Ray takes to swim a mile on a warm day, we need to calculate twice the time it takes him to swim a mile on a cold day and add 2 minutes to it. 

Time to swim a mile on a cold day = 16 minutes
Twice the time = 2 * 16 = 32 minutes
Time to swim a mile on a warm day = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a warm day.

Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes
Time to swim 3 miles on a warm day = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes

Now, we can find the difference in time between the two days.

Difference in time = Time to swim 3 miles on a warm day - Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day
= 102 - 48
= 54 minutes

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's break down John's situation. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. To find out his daily earnings, we multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a day:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Since he works 4 days a week, we need to calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a week:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, we can determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80 by dividing the target savings by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Since it costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, we multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

Cost of the foot-long fish sub: $40
Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub: $40 * 3 = $120

Now, we add the cost of both subs to find the total cost.

Total cost for both subs: $40 + $120 = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a bag of buttons with 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each, and the rest have 4 holes each.

First, let's find the number of buttons with 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes: 7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes.

Next, let's calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes: 14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes.

To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we add the holes from the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to find the size of Zack's locker first, and then find half of that size.

Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Zack's locker is 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.

Now, we need to find Peter's locker size. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so Peter's locker is 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and her husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. 

Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. 
Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.
Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

We are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. 
So, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of hamsters. There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters in each cage, so we multiply 3 by 10 to get the total number of hamsters: 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters.

Next, we find the number of guinea pigs. There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs in each cage, so we multiply 3 by 5 to get the total number of guinea pigs: 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together to get the total number of rodents: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to find their total weight and divide it by 3.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

The total weight of the 3 friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

The average weight of the 3 friends is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The final answer is: 180"
"The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when viewed from the entrance of Sahir's house. The sun is moving at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. If the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours, we need to calculate the final angle from the ground to the sun.

To do this, we first calculate the total angle moved by the sun in 10 hours. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so in 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Now, we add the initial angle of the pyramid (32 degrees) to the angle moved by the sun (50 degrees) to find the final angle from the ground to the sun.

Final angle from the ground to the sun = 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to figure out how many candles he needs. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are one per year of age, so James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy.

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the total pages she read in the first week and then add that to the total pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. To do this, we'll calculate a third of the total sandwiches, which is 12. A third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.

Next, we need to find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate. To do this, we'll calculate a quarter of the total sandwiches, which is 12. A quarter of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

Now, we need to find out how many sandwiches are left. We'll do this by subtracting the total number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches. Cody and Trevor ate a total of 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

So, the number of sandwiches left is 12 - 7 = 5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew. 

Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.
This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.
This simplifies to x = 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for each of the next three teeth, she left $1.00, so the total for those teeth is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

We know that Richie scored 80 goals. We also know that he scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna.

To find out how many goals Mark scored, we subtract 20 from Richie's total: 80 - 20 = 60.

To find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 45 from Richie's total: 80 - 45 = 35.

Now, let's add up the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses ordered per week is: 
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

"To find the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

First, let's determine the total cost. The bread costs $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. The cheese and condiments cost $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need to buy 1 set of cheese and condiments.

Total cost = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

Next, we calculate the total revenue. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.

Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to consider the area of the bedroom, the cost of the materials, and the cost of labor.

First, let's find the area of the bedroom. The length of the room is 18 feet and the width is 12 feet. The area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width: 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the materials. The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592. The padding costs $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432. The total cost of the materials is $2592 + $432 = $3024.

Next, let's calculate the cost of labor. The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864. The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344. The total cost of labor is $864 + $7344 = $8208.

Finally, we can find the total cost to replace the carpet by adding the cost of the materials and the cost of labor: $3024 + $8208 = $11232.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to first determine the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have. Since 90 single use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day.

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

The total number of days the contacts will last is:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, he will use a total of 180 contacts.

The cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is:
2 boxes * $100/box = $200
10% discount = $200 * 0.10 = $20
$200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:

"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns from her activities. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour.

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units there are.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 to find the total amount of water she needs to drink.

8 * 100 = 800

"The problem at hand is quite intriguing. We have a jar containing red, blue, and green jelly beans, with a note on the outside stating that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. We can express the total number of jelly beans as B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3.01B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3.01:
B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

Then, I called 10 friends to invite them personally, and 8 of them said they'd be bringing their spouses. That's 10 + 8 = 18 more people.

To find the total number of people attending, I add the two groups together: 300 + 18 = 318. However, I almost forgot that I'm also attending the event, so I need to add 1 to the total.

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first, then multiply it by 44.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"Let's break down the costs of the boots on both Amazon and eBay. 

The boots on Amazon cost $16, and shipping costs $4. So, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, but shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we first need to determine how much protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. If we denote Jerry's current age as 'x', we can express this relationship as an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since he needs 2 implants, the total base price is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a triangle, and we know that the sum of its three angles is 180 degrees. One angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle.

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. This means the other two angles are 2x and 3x, respectively.

Now, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combining like terms, we get 6x = 180.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

Since we're looking for the largest angle, we compare the three angles: 30, 60, and 90 degrees. The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in cents. 

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

The final answer is: 69"
"To find the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to 8 pounds gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than this, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down Steve's game collection over the years. 

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 24 = 29 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 48 = 53 games in the third year.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve gets in 3 years: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. Since he makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, we can divide 120 by 2 to get the hourly rate. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates per hour for Ruiz.

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. It's given that she makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 

To find Marissa's hourly rate, we multiply Ruiz's hourly rate by 3/4. 
60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds of chocolates per hour for Marissa.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"

To find the total amount he spent, we add these amounts together: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Since Howard originally had $100, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount to find out how much he has left: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total amount earned from each period, then add them together.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
Total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total amount earned in 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total amount earned in 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Total amount earned in 6 hours = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine how long the tires will last, we need to calculate the total number of rotations they can handle in a month. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can find the rotations per mile by dividing 725 by 2.

Rotations per mile = 725 rotations / 2 miles
Rotations per mile = 362.5 rotations/mile

Now, we can find the total rotations per month by multiplying the rotations per mile by the miles driven per month.

Rotations per month = 362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month
Rotations per month = 145,000 rotations/month

Next, we need to find out how many months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. We know the total allowed rotations are 10,440,000.

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 145,000
Months before replacement = 72

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 72 / 12
Years before replacement = 6

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price, which is $25. To find 30% of $25, we multiply 0.3 by $25, which equals $7.5.

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt by subtracting the discount from the original price: $25 - $7.5 = $17.5.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the items. We add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.5 + $35 = $52.5.

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately. Now, let's find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase. We subtract the total cost from the amount Joe has: $50 - $52.5 = -$2.5.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.5"
"To determine the amount of butter Juan needs to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of dozen croissants per day by the number of days:

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Now, we convert the total number of dozen croissants to individual croissants:
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Next, we find the amount of butter needed per dozen croissants, which is 1/4 pound. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the increased funding for the remaining 45 months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months, the funding is 50% more than the initial funding. 
50% of $100,000 is $50,000, so the increased funding is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

The total cost for the remaining 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months:

"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we first need to determine the total number of seats. Since there are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row, we can calculate the total number of seats as follows:

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we find the number of seats occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the total seats were occupied by the administrators.

Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Now, we need to find the remaining seats after the administrators have occupied their seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.

Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

To find the number of students, we subtract the number of parents from the remaining seats.

Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, and the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell, we can calculate the price of the gold Jewell as follows:

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Given that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold, we can calculate the price of the silver Jewell as follows:

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to find the number of truck and rose stamps first. 

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Max bought: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine how long it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider their relative speed and the distance between them.

First, let's find the relative speed between Tom and Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract their speeds to get the relative speed. Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour. The relative speed is 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.

Now, we need to divide the distance between them by the relative speed to find the time it will take for Tom to catch up. The distance between them is 75 miles.

Time = Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can find out how many fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17. 

17 - 6 = 11

So, Darren caught 11 fish. Now, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. We know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. 

11 + 3 = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Total cost of classes = $60
Number of classes = 10

Cost per class = Total cost of classes / Number of classes
Cost per class = $60 / 10
Cost per class = $6

Since Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's say Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and y classes at $10 per class. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

6x + 10y = 60

Since Manny can't attend a fraction of a class, we need to find the maximum whole number of classes he can attend at $6 per class.

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 1, 6(1) + 10y = 60
6 + 10y = 60
10y = 54
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 6(2) + 10y = 60
12 + 10y = 60
10y = 48
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 6(3) + 10y = 60
18 + 10y = 60
10y = 42
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 4, 6(4) + 10y = 60
24 + 10y = 60
10y = 36
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jewel processes 50 customers per day. To find her weekly production, we need to multiply this number by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

Jewel's daily production: 50 customers
Jewel's weekly production: 50 * 7 = 350 customers

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie's daily production is 50 * 2 = 100 customers.

Julie's weekly production: 100 * 7 = 700 customers

To find the total weekly production for the two, we add their individual weekly productions together.

Total weekly production: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers

The final answer is: 1050"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. 

Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

"To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to multiply the cost of 4 apples by 5/4. 
Cost of 4 apples = $5.20
Cost of 5 apples = $5.20 * (5/4) = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to multiply the cost of 3 oranges by 5/3.
Cost of 3 oranges = $3.30
Cost of 5 oranges = $3.30 * (5/3) = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole, is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can find the total time it will take him to dig the hole by multiplying the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"The promotion Tim received is quite a significant one. It includes a 5% raise on his monthly salary of $20,000. To calculate the new monthly salary, we need to find 5% of $20,000 and add it to the original amount.

5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000, which equals $1,000. Adding this to the original salary gives us a new monthly salary of $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

In addition to the raise, Tim also receives a bonus worth half a month's salary. Half of $20,000 is $10,000.

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income by adding the new monthly salary and the bonus: $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

To find the total annual income, we multiply the total monthly income by 12: $31,000 * 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"Let's break down the costs of James' new wardrobe.

First, we need to find the cost of the suits. James bought 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, which is $750 * 1/5 = $150 per pant. Since James bought 10 dress pants, the total cost of the pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James bought 3 dress shirts per suit, and since he bought 10 suits, he bought a total of 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we add up the costs of the suits, pants, and shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

"Let's break down the information given. Steve is 60 years old, and his wife is 4 years older than him, which makes her 64 years old.

Since their son is half as old as his mom, we can calculate his age by dividing his mom's age by 2. So, the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Now, we know that Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. To find her age, we subtract 3 from her husband's age: 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to first find the total amount of flour in one bag and then multiply it by 3.

Each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, so the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3 to find the total amount of flour in three bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet of soil per hour. Since he has to dig through 24 feet of soil, it will take him 24 / 4 = 6 hours to dig through the soil.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, which means he can dig 4 / 2 = 2 feet of clay per hour. Since he has to dig through 8 feet of clay, it will take him 8 / 2 = 4 hours to dig through the clay.

Now, let's add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay together. 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Fishio initially posted a selfie on Instagram and received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes increased significantly. We know that the number of likes after 3 weeks was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 

To find the number of likes after 3 weeks, we multiply the initial number of likes by 70. 
2000 * 70 = 140000.

However, we are not given the number of likes received in the 3 weeks between the initial post and the 3-week mark. Instead, we are told that Fishio received 20000 more new likes recently. Since the number of likes after 3 weeks is 140000, the number of likes received in the 3 weeks is 140000 - 2000 = 138000.

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the total number of likes after 3 weeks.
140000 + 20000 = 160000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. However, she received a $2 discount due to a voucher. To find the total cost, we need to subtract the discount from the total price:
20 * $20 = $400
$400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of pomegranates increased to $30 each, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. First, we need to calculate the total cost without the discount:
20 * $30 = $600
Next, we calculate the discount, which is 10% of $600:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$600 - $60 = $540

To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we subtract the cost of the first day from the cost of the second day:
$540 - $398 = $142

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In a particular month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total sales from green hats in that month ""x"". Then, the sales from red hats in that month is $400, which is half of x, so x/2 = $400.

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = $400 * 2 = $800.

So, in that month, Ariadne's total sales from green hats were $800 and from red hats were $400.

The total sales in that month are $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori needs for her party, we first need to find out how many deviled egg halves her guests will eat. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she's inviting 16 guests, we can multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves per guest.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves she needs to make. We already know she needs 48 deviled egg halves.

Number of deviled egg halves needed: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Lee has a farm with sheep and geese, and we're given two pieces of information: the total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20.

Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can write the equation 4S + 2G = 70 to represent the total number of legs.

We also know that each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, so the total number of heads can be represented as S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Now, substitute G = 20 - S into the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

"Let's calculate how much candy each of them would have after sharing. To do this, we need to add up the total amount of candy they have and then divide it by the number of people.

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy. 

Total candy = Robert's candy + Cindy's candy + Aaron's candy
Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4
Total candy = 12 pounds

There are 3 people sharing the candy, so we divide the total candy by 3:
12 / 3 = 4

Each of them would have 4 pounds of candy after sharing."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B. The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, and the cost of one candy of type B is $0.75.

First, we need to find the total cost of the type A candies: 7 candies * $0.5 = $3.5. Then, we calculate the total cost of the type B candies: 10 candies * $0.75 = $7.5.

Now, we add the costs of both types of candies together: $3.5 + $7.5 = $11. This is the total amount Adam spent on candies.

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, we need to find the change he got. To do this, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid: $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"Let's break down Christina's mood records. We know that over the past thirty days, she had twelve good days and eight bad days, with the rest being neutral. The first eight days were good, the next eight days were bad, and the third eight days were neutral.

Now, let's consider the next three days: good, neutral, and good. We need to find out how many good days were left in the month.

We already know that the first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good. So, the total number of good days we know about is 8 + 3 = 11. However, we know that Christina had 12 good days in total. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 12 - 11 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Let's break down the problem. We're told that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, we can represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. 

The relationship between Janey's and Sally's books can be expressed as: Janey's books = 2x + 3. Since we know Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation 2x + 3 = 21.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 21 - 3, which simplifies to 2x = 18.

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x': x = 18 / 2, which gives us x = 9.

So, Sally has 9 books."
"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 4 + 8 = 12.

When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. This brings the total number of dogs to 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12 + 28 = 40.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means the total number of toys needed is 40 - 3 = 37.

The final answer is: 37"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to calculate the remaining amount after Dylan and Frances invested.

Dylan's investment: 2/5 of $1200 = (2/5) * 1200 = 480

Remaining amount after Dylan's investment: 1200 - 480 = 720

Frances' investment: 2/3 of 720 = (2/3) * 720 = 480

"Let's break down the problem. Carol and Jennifer have been collecting signatures from celebrities during their summer break. After five weeks, Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. They want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer, which is after three more weeks.

First, we need to find out how many signatures they have in total so far. To do this, we add the number of signatures Carol and Jennifer have.

Total signatures so far = 20 (Carol's signatures) + 44 (Jennifer's signatures) = 64

Now, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect to reach their goal. We subtract the total signatures they have so far from their goal of 100.

Signatures needed = 100 (goal) - 64 (total signatures so far) = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal.

Signatures needed per week = 36 (signatures needed) / 3 (weeks remaining) = 12

The sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of 100 signatures."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows: 

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

We can then cross-multiply to solve for x:

6x = 96 * 36
6x = 3456
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: 576"
"To find out how much the group of adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 adults and then subtract the maximum load.

First, we'll find the total weight of the 9 adults. Since an adult weighs an average of 80 kg, we multiply this by the number of adults.

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Now, we'll find the difference between the total weight of the 9 adults and the maximum load of the elevator, which is 700 kg.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Max has 5 less cookies than Katarina, we can find Max's total by subtracting 5 from Katarina's cookies: 68 - 5 = 63 cookies for Max.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we subtract 12 from Max's total: 63 - 12 = 51 cookies for the Cookie Monster.

Now, we know Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. To find Summer's total, we add 23 to Max's total: 63 + 23 = 86 cookies for Summer.

To find the total number of cookies, we add up the number of cookies each person has: 68 (Katarina) + 63 (Max) + 51 (Cookie Monster) + 86 (Summer) = 268.

The final answer is: 268"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the added length. The dress was extended by 50% of its original length and then 20cm was added. Let's call the original length 'x'. 

The extension is 50% of x, which is 0.5x. Adding 20cm to this extension gives us 0.5x + 20.

The final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: x + (0.5x + 20) = 140.

Combine like terms: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120.

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Chris has a two-speed lawn mower. He can mow his entire lawn in 1 hour in ""turtle"" mode, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. Alternatively, he can mow the lawn in 40 minutes in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to calculate the time it took for each mode and then add them together. To find the time for each mode, we multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, we need to find the age of one of the twins.

Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

We have two equations based on the given information:

1. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, we need to find the age of the older twin. 

The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

The total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

So, the cost of 4 candies is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Rong saves 20 coins every month, and Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we need to calculate 2/5 of 20, which is 8. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20, the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"

Next, we find the cost of one orange, which is three times as much as a banana. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function at Mia's restaurant. To find out how many chairs are needed, we add the number of adults and babies together.

Total number of chairs needed = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57

Now, we need to find out how many regular chairs the restaurant has. We're told that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Since there are 8 high chairs, we can multiply 8 by 5 to find the number of regular chairs.

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Now that we know the total number of chairs needed and the total number of chairs available, we can find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get.

Total number of chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

Number of chairs needed to be added = Total number of chairs needed - Total number of chairs available

Adam has 50 points. Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 0.3 by 50, which equals 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Now, let's find out how many points Tom has. We know he has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. To find 3 times 35, we multiply 3 by 35, which equals 105. So, Martha has 105 points.

The total points collected by the class is 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate of chocolate ice cream, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

Now, let's look at the production rate of vanilla ice cream. The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate of vanilla ice cream, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now that we have the production rates for both types of ice cream, we can calculate the total quarts produced in 48 hours. For chocolate ice cream, we multiply the production rate by the number of hours: 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts. For vanilla ice cream, we multiply the production rate by the number of hours: 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts.

To find the total quarts of ice cream produced in 48 hours, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream: 2400 + 600 = 3000.

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item. Marcus ordered 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece, which is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00. He also ordered 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, which is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00. Additionally, he bought 3 mini quiches for $4.00 apiece, which is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. Lastly, he purchased 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each, which is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy, we need to consider the deal offered by the ice cream parlor. The deal is buy 2 scoops of ice cream, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. We can do this by dividing the total amount of money she has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal allows Erin to get 1 free scoop for every 2 scoops she buys. This means she can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. To take advantage of the deal, Erin should buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops. 

The remaining $1.50 can be used to buy 1 more scoop, making it a total of 4 scoops.

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two people, Ginger and Amy, who start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy each. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day.

To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount. Two weeks is equal to 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Now, let's calculate how much candy each person has left. Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the total number of mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we first need to calculate two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom. 

Two thirds of 36 is calculated as (2/3) * 36 = (2 * 36) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24.

So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 sq ft. 

For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 sq ft, he would need 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. James initially pays $20 to go blueberry picking. Then, he picks 30 pounds of blueberries at a cost of $1.5 per pound. To find the total cost of picking the blueberries, we multiply the cost per pound by the number of pounds: $1.5 * 30 = $45. Adding the initial cost, we get $20 + $45 = $65.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries at $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds. So, the total cost at the store would be $2.5 * 30 = $75.

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store: $75 - $65 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"The company in question wanted to purchase 500 computers. Initially, they had allocated $700 for each computer. However, upon ordering, they discovered that the price of each computer was 10% higher than their initial estimate.

To determine the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of the original price. This is done by multiplying the original price by 0.1. So, 0.1 x 700 = 70.

The new price of each computer is the original price plus the 10% increase, which is 700 + 70 = 770.

Now, to find the total amount the company paid for 500 computers, we multiply the new price by the number of computers: 500 x 770 = 385,000.

The final answer is: $385,000"

First, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils: 6 pencils * $0.50 = $3. 

Next, we'll calculate the total cost of the erasers: 8 erasers * $0.25 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and erasers together: $3 + $2 = $5.

Since we paid $10, we need to find the change. To do that, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: $10 - $5 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that 100 people apply for a job at Google. 

First, we need to find out how many people receive interviews. Since 30% of the applicants receive interviews, we can calculate this as follows:
30% of 100 = 0.3 * 100 = 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we need to determine how many of those who receive interviews receive a job offer. This is 20% of the people who received interviews:
20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, we need to find out how many of those who receive a job offer accept the position. Since a third of those who receive a job offer accept the position, we can calculate this as follows:
A third of 6 = 6 / 3 = 2 people accept the position.

"Let's break down Helga's clog dancing into two scenarios: when her arms are down and when her arms are up.

When her arms are down, Helga can tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute and her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute. This means she taps a total of 550 times per minute. Since she dances for 3 minutes with her arms down, the total number of taps in this scenario is 550 * 3 = 1650.

When her arms are up, Helga's tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute for each foot. This means she taps a total of 400 times per minute. Since she dances for 2 minutes with her arms up, the total number of taps in this scenario is 400 * 2 = 800.

To find the combined total number of taps, we add the taps from both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"The pothole in front of Ron's house is causing quite a headache. If it's not fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. However, the city council is unwilling to fix it, and if Ron decides to take matters into his own hands, he'll be fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance. Additionally, he'll need to purchase 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each.

To calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole, we need to add the fine and the cost of the asphalt. The fine is $120, and the cost of the asphalt is 3 * $25 = $75. So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the total damage it will cause to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is: $255"
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

The restaurant initially had 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. 

Total chairs sent for repair = 20 (normal) + 13 (baby) = 33

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs left. We'll subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of normal and baby chairs separately, then add the results.

Normal chairs left = 170 - 20 = 150
Baby chairs left = 23 - 13 = 10

Total chairs left = Normal chairs left + Baby chairs left
Total chairs left = 150 + 10
Total chairs left = 160

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people in total, including Bryce and his 4 friends. 

First, let's find out how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

40 slices - 24 slices = 16 slices

Now, we know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

Total number of slices = 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices
Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 16 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches, so 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches. 
Adding 4 inches to that gives us 96 + 4 = 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

- Now, we know Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so we multiply Sean's marbles by 4: 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: 224 (Carl) + 112 (Cal) = 336.

The final answer is: 336"
"To find out how many more groups are needed, we first need to determine the number of students per group. We have a total of 54 students and we want to divide them into 6 groups. 

Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we are told that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students, we multiply the number of groups by the students per group.

Total students = Number of groups * Students per group
Total students = 12 * 9
Total students = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups.

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

Since each group requires 9 students, we need to find the number of additional groups required.

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month).

In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. 

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekend days: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, multiply the total chairs rented in a week by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month):
500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"Let's break down the events step by step to find out how many bananas Gunther had at the end.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

When Arnold stole half of the bananas, he took 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. So, the number of bananas left is 48 - 24 = 24.

Gunther then added 25 bananas to the pile, making it 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

However, Arnold wasn't done yet. He stole another 12 bananas, leaving 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

Finally, Gunther added 6 more bananas to the pile, bringing the total to 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

The final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to first find out how much they will pay per month and then multiply it by 12.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, they will divide the bill equally among themselves. 

$100 / 4 = $25 per roommate per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12:

$25 * 12 = $300 per roommate per year.

The final answer is: $300"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30 small stickers, we multiply 0.9 by 30, which equals 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. To find 50% of 40 large stickers, we multiply 0.5 by 40, which equals 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

Next, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers, 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons. To find the total number of buttons she has, we add these together: 3 + 20 + 27 + 20 = 70.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the council has 33 members and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. 

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

"To find the total number of shirts ordered, we need to calculate the number of students for each size and add them together.

First, we know that 11 students need size extra-small. Then, twice as many students need size small as extra small, which is 2 * 11 = 22 students. 

Next, four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.

We also know that half as many students need size large as size medium, which is 18 / 2 = 9 students.

Finally, six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add the number of students for each size together:
11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and then the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
2. One third of the Pomeranians are girls.
3. There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and we are given that this number is 6. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we found that there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for the three houses is 250. We also know that the first house needs 1/2 of the second, and the third house needs double the first.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles, and the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

Now, we can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to determine how many books he read in that hour.

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can find Ahmed's total by dividing Ezra's total by 2. 

Ahmed's books = 300 / 2 = 150

Now, we know Ezra will read a total of 300 + 150 = 450 books.

To find the total number of books both Ezra and Ahmed read, we simply add their individual totals together.

Total books read by Ahmed = 150
Total books read by Ezra = 450
Total books read by both = 150 + 450 = 600

"To find the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to first calculate the total time she has available and the time she spends playing soccer.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total time available - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
= 12 - 3 - 3
= 6 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer:
Percentage = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection.

First, we need to find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we divide the total number of movies by 3:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:
200 * $6 = $1200

Next, we find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

Now, we need to find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply the remaining movies by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot. 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma separately and then find the difference.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. 

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is (60 - (x + 4)) = 56 - x.

The total score for Emma is x + 0 (since she doesn't jump on any extra enemies or collect any extra berries) + 0 (since she finishes the level in the same time as the timer is 60 seconds) = x.

The total score for Ava is (x + 8) + (x + 3) + (56 - x) = 2x + 67.

However, we can simplify this problem by directly calculating the difference in their scores. 

The difference in their enemy scores is 8.
The difference in their berry scores is 3.
The difference in their timer scores is (60 - (x + 4)) - 60 = -4.

The difference in their scores is 8 + 3 - 4 = 7.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known.

The total cost of the two known pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas.

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. He then bought some more fish from the pet store, where a sales assistant dipped out 17 fish from a mixed tank.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O. After adding these fish to his pond, he found that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

We can set up two equations based on this information. The first equation comes from the fact that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17: W + O = 17.

The second equation comes from the fact that Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We can solve the second equation for O: O = 2(4 + W) - 3 = 8 + 2W - 3 = 5 + 2W.

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the first equation: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combine like terms: 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

The distance between his home and office is 5 miles, and he travels this distance twice a day (to and from work), so the total daily distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost per week: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt. 

First, we need to find the total value of the quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter: 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, we need to find the total value of the twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply the number of twenties by the value of each twenty: 10 * $20 = $200.

However, Carrie only spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find the amount she spent, we multiply the total value of the twenties by 3/5: 3/5 * $200 = $120.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money she spent. We add the value of the quarters to the value of the twenties she spent: $35 + $120 = $155.

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to find the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point. 

The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder, so it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

The temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to determine the number of groups formed. Since 90 people were required to split into groups, and each group had 9 members, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we need to find the number of groups that brought back seashells. Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we can calculate this as follows:

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we can find the total number of seashells. Each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells, so we can calculate the total number of seashells as follows:

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to track the changes in the number of passengers at each stop.

Initially, there were 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

The number of people on the train is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's calculate how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month. 

Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day on his way home, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. To find the total amount of money he makes, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the value of each bottle cap and then multiply the result by the number of days in the month.

First, we multiply the number of bottle caps per day by the value of each bottle cap:
10 * $0.25 = $2.50 per day

Then, we multiply the daily amount by the number of days in the month:
$2.50 * 30 = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. 150% of $20 is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. For 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. 

First, we know there are 12 female lions. 
Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can find the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2: 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.
We also know there are 14 lion cubs.

Now, we can add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions: 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"The original price of Mike's favorite jeans was $40. However, they're on sale for 25% off. To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40
25% of $40 = $10

Now, let's find the price after the discount:
Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

Since Mike is paying with a $50 bill, we need to find out how much money he'll have left over:
Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
200 employees * $4000 = $800,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$800,000 * 3 = $2,400,000

The final answer is: $2,400,000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, and the choir plans to sing it twice. So, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long. 

Now, let's add the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find Billy's hourly wage after his raises. Initially, Billy was paid $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Then, on his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Sally's hourly wage. Her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Next, we need to find their total earnings after working 20 hours. Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230. Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"

Pierson's score is 278. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class.

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply the result by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Total trees planted = Total trees planted by students + Total trees planted by teachers
Total trees planted = 1000 + 240
Total trees planted = 1240

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more. 

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we can set up the equation: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has played.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two cars traveling on a highway. The first car is moving at a speed of 60 miles per hour, and the second car is moving at a speed of 70 miles per hour. We want to find out how many miles will separate them after 2 hours.

To do this, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. The distance traveled by an object is given by the formula: distance = speed * time. 

For the first car, the distance traveled in 2 hours is:
distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

For the second car, the distance traveled in 2 hours is:
distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

Now, we need to find the distance between the two cars. This is simply the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the ring, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the 30% premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Adding these together gives us $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we need to calculate the 30% premium. This is done by multiplying the total cost of the diamond and gold by 0.3, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold to get the final amount James paid: $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"

- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders, and the pass rate of fourth-graders is 40/100, the pass rate of fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we first need to figure out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with the glass chips he has. Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many chips he has in total.

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with 144 chips.

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it can be. We know that the area of a rectangle (such as the mosaic) is length * width. Since we know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), we can find the length.

Area = length * width
12 = length * 3
length = 12 / 3
length = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can find the total amount of tea drank in gallons by dividing 38 by 4, which equals 9.5 gallons. 

However, we are asked to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, which includes the tea left. The amount of tea left is 10 quarts. 

To find the total amount of tea at the beginning, we need to add the amount of tea drank to the amount of tea left. 

Total tea at the beginning = 38 (tea drank) + 10 (tea left) = 48 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the situation. Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies. He then sold 150 of them. To find out how many candies he has left, we need to subtract the number of candies he sold from the initial number of candies he ordered. 

100 (initial candies) - 150 (candies sold) = -50 (candies left)

However, having a negative number of candies doesn't make sense. This means Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold. 

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. So, he now has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 candies.

Since he sold 150 candies, he still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We start with 10 students at the beginning of the year. Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

Now, to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch.

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"The task at hand is to determine the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase. To do this, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that John and DeSean bought a bag of marshmallows, and they have a total of 35 marshmallows. Each S'more requires one marshmallow, and they both make 9 S'mores each. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

First, we need to find out how many marshmallows they used in total. Since John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, the total number of marshmallows used is 9 + 9 = 18. However, we also need to account for the 3 marshmallows they dropped, so the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

Now, we can find out how many marshmallows are left by subtracting the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial total. So, 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows are left.

Since there are two kids, John and DeSean, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have. Therefore, 14 / 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have four people playing games at the arcade: Jack and three of his friends. Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. Two of his friends are less skilled and can only play for half the time, which is 10 minutes per quarter. The other friend is more skilled and can play for 1.5 times the time, which is 30 minutes per quarter.

They play for a total of 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time played by each person. Jack plays for 240 minutes. The two less skilled friends play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. The more skilled friend plays for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played is 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

To find the total amount of money used, we multiply the total time played by the cost per minute: 840 * 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats: 3 goats * $500 = $1500.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the cows: 2 cows * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent a total of $4500 at the market."
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

First, let's add up the number of cupcakes Paul already has: 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. That's a total of 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we subtract the number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which gives us 8 cars sold.

Now, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

So, Joe gives away a total of 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine how much money the students raised in total. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, bringing the total to 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, he noticed that half of the cars had left. To find the number of cars that left, we need to calculate half of 70, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35.

So, 35 cars left the parking lot. To find the number of cars remaining, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars before the lunch break: 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, when Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, there were 35 cars in the parking lot.

The final answer is: 35"
"To determine how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate his daily earnings first. 

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. Each task pays $1.20. 

Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Since John works a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7 to find his weekly earnings.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"Let's break down the information given about the basketball games between Sasha and Julie. 

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. We know that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. So, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.

Now, let's consider the second game. Sasha struggles during away games, and this one was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her points from each game: 14 + 4 = 18.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs: Cindy had 5 of those.

Next, we know she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. So, 2 times the number of green eggs is 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

Now, let's move on to the pink eggs. Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, which means she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, we have the yellow eggs. Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. To find this number, we divide the number of pink eggs by 3: 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"To determine how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles.

Cost per pound: $0.35
Weight of the book: 4 pounds
Cost per mile: $0.08
Distance: 20 miles

The total cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
(0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20) = 1.4 + 1.6 = $2.99

Next, we need to find the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The purchase price of the book is $32.

Refund amount: 0.75 * 32 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
Total cost of shipping: $2.99
Refund amount: $24
Total loss: 2.99 + (32 - 24) = 2.99 + 8 = $10.99

"Let's break down Boris's chocolate production for the first three weeks. 

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate. 
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production. The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's break down the time Britany spends on TikTok-related activities per week:

- She spends 2 hours writing amateur songs, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes on makeup, 6 days a week, which is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.
- She records 18 videos, each lasting 4 minutes, so the total time spent on recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity: 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the initial installation and the additional items Angela needs.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures for $129.00. Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed.

For the additional mirrors, we subtract the 4 included in the initial installation from the total number of mirrors Angela has: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. The cost for these additional mirrors is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

For the additional chandeliers, we subtract the 1 included in the initial installation from the total number of chandeliers Angela has: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier. The cost for this additional chandelier is 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

For the additional pictures, we subtract the 10 included in the initial installation from the total number of pictures Angela has: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures. The cost for these additional pictures is 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, we add up the costs of the additional items: $30.00 (mirrors) + $15.00 (chandelier) + $150.00 (pictures) = $195.00.

Finally, we add the cost of the initial installation to the cost of the additional items: $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take a total of 18 hours to cross the highway. To find out how long it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway, we need to divide the total time by the number of kangaroos. 

So, one kangaroo would take 18 / 3 = 6 hours to travel across the highway.

Now, we're told that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means they will take twice as long to travel across the highway. Since there are four turtles, we need to multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2 and then by 4.

So, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is 6 * 2 * 4 = 48 hours.

"Let's break down Erika's situation. She's saving for a new laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price of the new one will be reduced by $200, making it $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has received some money from her part-time job, which is $150, and her mom has given her $80 to help out. So, the total amount of money she's received is $150 + $80 = $230.

Since Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs, which is $400 + $50 = $450.

To find out how much money Erika had in her purse initially, we subtract the money she received from the total amount she has: $450 - $230 = $220.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam wants to eat some sliced apples. He decides to slice 3 large apples and 5 small apples.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so 3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

To find the total number of apple slices, we add the slices from the large and small apples together: 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack collected by dividing the number of dishes by 2. Jack collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes together is 180."
"Let's break down the information given: there are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. 5 of them are good at math only, and 8 of them perform well in English only. The rest are good at both math and English.

To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English. The students good at both math and English are counted in both the math only and English only groups, so we need to add them to the students good at math only to get the total number of students good at math.

First, let's find the number of students good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total, and 5 are good at math only and 8 are good at English only, the number of students good at both math and English is 20 - (5 + 8) = 7.

Now, we can find the total number of students good at math by adding the students good at math only and those good at both math and English: 5 + 7 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine how many groups can perform at Vicki's pop concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time for each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes to perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

After 1 year, Brenda will have: $300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525
After 2 years, Brenda will have: $525 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $750
After 3 years, Brenda will have: $750 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $975

"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to determine the number of white shirts that have collars. Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, that's 40 / 2 = 20 shirts with collars. 

The number of white shirts with no collars is then 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. 

The difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many goats were sold from Farm Y. Since Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, and he sold 10 goats from Farm X, we can calculate the number of goats sold from Farm Y by multiplying the number of goats sold from Farm X by 2. 
Number of goats sold from Farm Y = 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we know that Mr. Smith sold 20 goats from Farm Y. To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm Y.
Number of goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of goats left in Farm X. We know that Mr. Smith initially had 55 goats in Farm X and he sold 10 goats. To find the number of goats left in Farm X, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm X.
Number of goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45

Finally, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y.
Total number of goats left = 45 + 25 = 70

"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to determine the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of that would be 45 rooms.

45 rooms need to be cleaned, and it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. To find the total time, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

Now, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60.

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have the following information:

1. I am three years younger than my brother, so my brother's age is x + 3.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1.
4. The sum of our ages is 87.

We can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

However, age cannot be a decimal, so we need to re-examine the equation. Let's try to find a whole number solution.

Since x must be a whole number, we can try x = 8 or x = 9.

If x = 8, then my brother's age is 8 + 3 = 11, my sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6, and my mom's age is 3(11) - 1 = 32.

The sum of our ages is 8 + 11 + 6 + 32 = 57, which is less than 87.

If x = 9, then my brother's age is 9 + 3 = 12, my sister's age is 9 - 2 = 7, and my mom's age is 3(12) - 1 = 35.

The sum of our ages is 9 + 12 + 7 + 35 = 63, which is still less than 87.

If x = 10, then my brother's age is 10 + 3 = 13, my sister's age is 10 - 2 = 8, and my mom's age is 3(13) - 1 = 38.

The sum of our ages is 10 + 13 + 8 + 38 = 69, which is still less than 87.

If x = 11, then my brother's age is 11 + 3 = 14, my sister's age is 11 - 2 = 9, and my mom's age is 3(14) - 1 = 41.

The sum of our ages is 11 + 14 + 9 + 41 = 75, which is still less than 87.

If x = 12, then my brother's age is 12 + 3 = 15, my sister's age is 12 - 2 = 10, and my mom's age is 3(15) - 1 = 44.

The sum of our ages is 12 + 15 + 10 + 44 = 81, which is still less than 87.

If x = 13, then my brother's age is 13 + 3 = 16, my sister's age is 13 - 2 = 11, and my mom's age is 3(16) - 1 = 47.

The sum of our ages is 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.

Therefore, the correct answer is 13."
"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack.

First, let's find the total number of glue sticks required. Mr. Jackson has 27 students, and he wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. So, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Now, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack, which is 8. 54 / 8 = 6.75.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, this amount doubles to 8000 gallons. 

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. To find the new total, we need to add this increase to the amount from the second day. So, 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Now, we need to add the initial amount of water to the total from the third day to find the overall amount of water passing through the river at that point. 4000 + 14000 = 16000 gallons.

The final answer is: 16000"
"To find the total number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day and add them up.

Day 1: 
- Initially, there are 10 people infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new people are infected.
- Total people infected after Day 1: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2: 
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total people infected after Day 2: 70 (previous) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 490.

Day 3: 
- The 360 people infected on Day 2 infect 360 * 6 = 2160 new people.
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total people infected after Day 3: 490 (previous) + 2160 (new) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 3070.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves every hour, and she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. So, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked a total of 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and we need to convert this to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can divide the price per slice by 100 to get the price in dollars: 50 cents / 100 = 0.5 dollars per slice.

Now, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

However, I made a slight miscalculation. Let's redo the math: 80 * 0.5 = 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can find the number of silver coins by subtracting 30 from the number of gold coins.

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
Number of silver coins = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins.

Total coins = Number of silver coins + Number of gold coins
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

The total number of burritos eaten is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos in total, the number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three variables: the number of books Sofie has (S), the number of books Anne has (A), and the number of books Fawn has (F).

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can express this as S = A + 25.

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, which can be expressed as A = F - 12.

Now, let's combine these two equations. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25.

Simplifying this, we get S = F + 13.

We also know that the total number of books they have together is 85, so we can write the equation S + A + F = 85.

Substituting the first equation into this equation, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85.

Combining like terms, we get 2F + A + 13 = 85.

Now, let's substitute the second equation into this equation. We get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85.

Combining like terms, we get 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get 3F = 84.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get F = 28.

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens is:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000, so the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, the amount he needs to make from selling the chickens to make a profit of $2000 is $9000. 

However, we are asked for the cost price of the chickens. To find the cost price, we need to subtract the profit from the selling price. 

The selling price is $9000 and the profit is $2000.

Now, we need to find out when her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call the number of years it takes for her age to be thrice her present age 'x'. At that time, her age will be 8 + x, and it will be thrice her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

So, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 24.

Solving for x, we get x = 24 - 8 = 16.

Therefore, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, we can find the cost of one pack of bacon by dividing the total cost by the number of packs: $10 / 5 = $2. Then, we multiply this by 2 to find the cost of one packet of chicken: $2 * 2 = $4. Now, we multiply the cost of one packet of chicken by the number of packets Kelly has: 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, we need to find the cost of the apples. Since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, and the strawberries cost $4 each, we can find the cost of one pack of apples by dividing the cost of a strawberry by 2: $4 / 2 = $2. Now, we multiply the cost of one pack of apples by the number of packs Kelly has: 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we can find the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart by adding up the cost of the bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples: $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and at the end of the concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as x minutes. The final concert's runtime is 2x minutes, and the encore is 15 minutes. We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's calculate how many toys Argo has now. 

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then multiply the number made on Friday by 2.

The number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday is 125 + 125 = 250. 
The number of chimichangas made on Friday is 2 * 125 = 250.
So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 250 + 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the singer has 50 microphones in total, and 20% of them won't find any space to fit in. This means 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs.

To find the number of microphones that will be arranged in pairs, we can calculate 80% of 50. 

80% of 50 = 0.8 * 50 = 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the total number of microphones arranged in pairs by 2.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's consider the birds nesting in the bushes: 6 birds.

Next, we have birds flying overhead, which is 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. To find this, we multiply 6 by 2/3: (2/3) * 6 = 4.

Now, let's look at the birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8: 3 * 8 = 24.

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group: 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies and then divide the result by the number of jars.

Total cookies = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 55 - 5 = 50

Number of jars = 5
Cookies per jar = Cookies left / Number of jars = 50 / 5 = 10

Therefore, there were 10 cookies in each jar.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Since Joelle has 5 orchids and each orchid has 5 petals, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, we calculate the total number of petals on the daisies. Joelle has 4 daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals, so we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we first need to determine the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

One-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants: 100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants.

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants: 75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants: 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first determine the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down Ellen's daily expenses. She buys two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which means it costs $3.

To find the cost of one carrot, we need to consider the total daily cost, which is $11. We can represent the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Since Ellen buys two carrots, the total cost of the carrots is 2x.

The total cost equation is: 2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

So, the cost of one carrot is $1."
"Let's break down Mark's new weekly earnings. He works 8 hours a day, and his pay was increased by $2 per hour. His original hourly wage was $10, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

To find out his weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of hours he works in a week. Since he works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, the total number of hours is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x (for Joe's lawn) + 18x (for Kamala's lawn) + 30x (for Alba's lawn) = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

To find y, we need to find the value of x. Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y. 
54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

First, let's find his total earnings. John rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour. 

Total earnings = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, we need to subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Car payment: $500

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha.
2. Martha bought 5 more notebooks, and now she has a total of 7 notebooks.

From point 2, we can find out how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since she bought 5 more and now has 7, she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha had 2 notebooks initially, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Susan initially made 100 cookies for her nephews. However, her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself before she could package them. 

To find out how many cookies are left, we subtract the number of cookies taken by her husband from the total number of cookies. 

100 (initial cookies) - 4 (cookies taken by her husband) = 96 cookies left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Let's break down the information given. Denise read 10 pages yesterday, and Daniel read 13 pages yesterday. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, we can calculate Denise's total pages read today as 5 + 13 = 18.

To find out Denise's total pages read, we add the pages she read yesterday and today: 10 + 18 = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 pages since he didn't read any pages today.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel: 28 - 13 = 15.

"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows. 

So, the number of cups in each row is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 / 2 = 4.5. However, since you can't have half a cup of tea, this means that the number of mint tea cups in each row must be 4 or 5.

Let's consider the two possibilities:

If there are 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. 

If there are 5 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15.

Since the total number of mint tea cups is 15, the correct answer is 5.

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, and there are 10000 gallons of water in the pool, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Next, we need to find the total amount of water used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the total amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"Let's break down Colby's expenses for the month. He's already spent money on 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays ($10 each) and 8 movies on other days ($7 each), 2 tubs of popcorn ($8 each), and 4 boxes of candy ($2 each).

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on movies: 5 * $10 = $50 for Friday and Saturday movies, and 8 * $7 = $56 for other days. The total spent on movies is $50 + $56 = $106.

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent on snacks: 2 * $8 = $16 for popcorn and 4 * $2 = $8 for candy. The total spent on snacks is $16 + $8 = $24.

Now, let's add the total spent on movies and snacks: $106 + $24 = $130.

Colby's monthly budget is $150, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can spend $10 of his remaining money on a ticket. This leaves him with $20 - $10 = $10.

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

In total, Colby can see 1 movie on a Friday and 1 movie on another day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 
Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories. 
Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 378 / 5 = 75.6"
"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled. 

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so it traveled 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so it traveled 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to determine how many toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls and then subtract that from the total number of toys after the purchase.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks, the bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals, and the tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings. 

Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls = 31 + 8 + 9
= 48

We know that after buying the bouncy balls, Sophie had a total of 62 toys. 

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after buying bouncy balls - Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J. 

We can start by using the information that Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
Pp = J + 10

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
P = Pp + J

Now, we can use the fact that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
P + Pp + J = 100

Substituting Pp with J + 10 in the equation P + Pp + J = 100:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P with Pp + J in the equation P + 2J + 10 = 100:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
3J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
3J = 80
Divide both sides by 3:
J = 80/3
J = 26.67

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 26.67 + 10
Pp = 36.67

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 36.67 + 26.67
P = 63.34

The final answer is: 63.34"
"Let's break down the situation. Maria invited 4 friends over for a water balloon fight. At the start, she gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. So, her friends have a total of 4 * 2 = 8 balloons. Maria also has 1 balloon for herself. 

In total, they have 8 (friends' balloons) + 1 (Maria's balloon) = 9 balloons initially.

Then, Maria's mom comes out and gives each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine how many tables the charity group needs, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, so they need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"The watermelon seed spitting contest between Zoey and Sydney is quite the event. To determine the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each participant and then divide by the number of seeds.

Zoey's watermelon has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet. So, her total distance is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney's watermelon has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet. Therefore, her total distance is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Now, let's add their total distances together: 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we need to divide the total distance by the total number of seeds spat. The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

Average total distance spat = Total distance spat / Total seeds spat = 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet

The final answer is: 10.93"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000.

First, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. To do this, we'll multiply the number of widgets each machine can produce per hour by the number of hours it runs per day and then by the number of days in the month.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and runs 24 hours a day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total number of widgets it can produce is:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and also runs 24 hours a day. With 30 days in the month, the total number of widgets it can produce is:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now that we know the total number of widgets each machine can produce, we can calculate the total revenue from each machine. Since each widget sells for $6, we'll multiply the total number of widgets by the price of each widget.

The revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 is:
43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 is:
32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we'll subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"Let's break down Cameron's hotel stay. He arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay, and 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. However, Cameron can also choose to pay 1000 pesos for the initial 12 hours and an additional 70 pesos for every hour after that.

Since Cameron stays for 17 hours, he needs to pay for the initial 12 hours and 5 additional hours. The cost of the additional hours is 70 * 5 = 350 pesos.

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost of the 24-hour option is 1600 pesos. To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the 12-hour option with additional hours instead of the 24-hour option.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat requires 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs by finding twice the amount each goat needs and then subtracting 3 pounds.

Twice the amount each goat needs is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"Let's break down John's situation. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked for 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars. After spending 50 dollars on gas, he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

John also wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, which means he'll have 250 - 100 = 150 dollars remaining.

Now, let's consider the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars, and John wants to buy 5 of them. The total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. After buying the pencils, John will have 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

With the remaining 100 dollars, John can buy 25-dollar pens. To find out how many pens he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of each pen: 100 / 25 = 4.

So, John can buy 4 pens with the money he has left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters Craig spelled to the total number of letters his brother spelled: 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: 650"
"To find the total number of children participating in the drill, we need to calculate the total number of children in one school and then multiply it by the number of schools.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows. So, the total number of children in one school is 8 * 7 = 56.

Now, we have 5 different schools, each with 56 children. To find the total number of children, we multiply 56 by 5.

Total number of children = 56 * 5
Total number of children = 280

The final answer is: 280"
"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles she gives to the students. 

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she gets is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, to find out how many bottles she has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she got. 

900 - 58 = 842

"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the visit fee.

First, let's calculate the labor cost. Since Patty charges $35 per hour, or part thereof, for labor, we multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly rate. In this case, the job took 2.25 hours, so the labor cost is 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75.

Next, we need to add the cost of parts, which is $60, and the visit fee, which is $40.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. James gets 10 new CDs, each costing $15. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of CDs by the cost per CD.

Total cost = 10 * $15 = $150

However, James gets a 40% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (40% or 0.4).

Discount = $150 * 0.4 = $60

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final price James paid.

Price after discount = $150 - $60 = $90

James decides to sell 5 CDs for $40 each. To find the total amount he made from selling these CDs, we multiply the number of CDs sold by the selling price per CD.

Total amount made = 5 * $40 = $200

To find out how much money James was out, we need to compare the amount he made from selling the CDs to the price he paid for them. Since he made $200 and paid $90, he was actually out $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find out how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of crop and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the yams. She has 6 yams that can be sold at $1.5 each, so the total earnings from yams are 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we'll calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes. She has 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each, so the total earnings from sweet potatoes are 10 * $2 = $20.

Lastly, we'll calculate the earnings from the carrots. She has 4 carrots that cost $1.25 each, so the total earnings from carrots are 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

"Let's break down James' journey across the lake. First, we need to find the time it took him to swim 60% of the 20-mile lake. To do this, we'll calculate 60% of 20 miles.

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, so we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

15 (initial stickers) - 7 (lost stickers) = 8

After losing 7 stickers, Jasmine has 8 stickers left. Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. To find the total number of stickers she has now, we add the stickers she received to the ones she already had.

8 (remaining stickers) + 5 (additional stickers) = 13

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end."
"To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

Commission from New York Times: 
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
- Commission = 300 / 100
- Commission = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal: 
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100
- Commission = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100

2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is twice Marcus's age.

To find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2: 21 * 2 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. 

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We can express Bahati's score in terms of Azibo's score as B = A + 20. 

We can also express Bahati's score in terms of Dinar's score as B = D + 10. 

Since both expressions represent Bahati's score, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We can simplify this equation to A = D - 10. 

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so we can write the equation A + B + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation A + B + D = 45 to get A + (A + 20) + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45. 

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation A + B + D = 45 to get A + (D + 10) + D = 45. 

This simplifies to A + 2D + 10 = 45. 

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and A + 2D + 10 = 45. 

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (A + 2D + 10) = 45 - 45. 

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0. 

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10. 

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation A + 2D + 10 = 45 to get (D - 10) + 2D + 10 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = 15 - 10. 

This simplifies to A = 5. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider that each paper is printed on both sides, effectively doubling the number of pages per inch. Given that there are 100 pages to the inch, we multiply this by 2 to get the total number of pages per inch, which is 200.

Now, we know the book is 1.5 inches thick. To find the total number of pages in the book, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 200 * 1.5 = 300 pages.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. Vince stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:
15 * 60 = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 / 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 * 60 = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of cups.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of spoons.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the total number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to determine the initial number of occupied beds. Since 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we can calculate this as follows:

1/5 of 1000 = 200

This means that 200 beds are occupied initially. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract this from the total capacity:

1000 - 200 = 800

Now, we need to account for the patients admitted due to the coronavirus outbreak. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we multiply this by the number of days in 2 weeks (14):

50 * 14 = 700

These patients will occupy the hospital beds, so we add this to the initial number of occupied beds:

200 + 700 = 900

Finally, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds:

1000 - 900 = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work-related. To find out how many emails are not work-related, we subtract the work emails from the total: 16 - 7 = 9.

Now, we know that two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family. To find two-thirds of 9, we multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3: (2/3) * 9 = (2 * 9) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. So, 6 emails are to her family.

The remaining non-work emails (not to family) are 9 - 6 = 3. Now, we need to find out how many of these emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from the number reported by Courtney.

Let's assume the number reported by Courtney is 100%. 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, let's find the total number of balls carried by the three boys. We add the number of balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls carried by the boys, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is also 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"The pirate crew's digging adventure is quite the tale. Let's break it down step by step. They started by digging 10 holes on the first day. The next day, they dug 13 more holes, bringing the total to 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes but had to fill in 2 of them, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

Now, we're told that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. Amora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally, but it turned out that only two people would get an equal amount, while the other person would receive 15 more corn chips than the number the others got. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each.

Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add the number of corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = 70 + 70 + 85
Total = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"I'm Alex, and I'm super excited to figure out how many Pokémon my friends Stan and Adelwolfe have caught. We've caught a total of 339 Pokémon together. I've caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

Let's start by using some variables to represent the number of Pokémon each of us has caught. I'll use A for Adelwolfe, S for Stan, and L for me (Alex). We know that A + S + L = 339.

I've caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so L = S + 5.

Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now, let's substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Next, substitute the third equation into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.
9A - 21 = 339.

Now, let's add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Next, let's divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan has caught: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's break down the information given: each episode of the show is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode.

Since there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, the number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 10 hours. The bird flies at a speed of 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled is 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Next, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this direction is 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Finally, the bird changes direction and flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this direction is 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Since the bird traveled 36 miles north, we need to subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to find the net distance between the two homes.

Net distance = Distance traveled in the first 10 hours + Distance traveled in the last 5 hours - Distance traveled in the 2 hours
Net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"Let's break down the brownie situation for Greta. She started with a batch of 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is equivalent to 12 brownies. 

At her office, she received 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. 

Later, her friends surprised her with 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we add the brownies from each source: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

However, during the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is equivalent to 18 brownies.

To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she had: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

To find Nani's sister's age, we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age. Since 25% is the same as 0.25, we multiply Nani's age by 0.25 to find the age difference. The age difference is 8 * 0.25 = 2 years. To find Nani's sister's age, we subtract the age difference from Nani's age: 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

First, let's find the time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Next, we'll calculate the time for polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Then, we'll find the time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we add these times together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

The final answer is: 227"
"Let's break down the cost of the phones. The first two phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining two phones are half price, so each costs $600 / 2 = $300. The total cost for the remaining two phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

To find the total cost for all four phones, we add the cost of the first two phones to the cost of the remaining two phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to find the number of players in Zeke's team and add it to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Carlton's team has 13 players. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can find the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

13 + 7 = 20

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed for the fence, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the garden is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges at the market. Each box contains 20 oranges, so she initially had 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She then gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. This means she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, let's find out how many oranges she had left. We subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the initial total: 240 - 80 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of states in both the USA and India, we need to determine the number of states in each country. 

The USA has 50 states. 

Now, let's find the number of states in India. It's mentioned that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25, and 4 more than 25 is 29. 

So, India has 29 states. 

To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books he wants to buy. 

The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

The total cost of the books is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so we can find the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. To find out how many cherries Richard has, we need to subtract 10 from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Richard and Robert have 20 + 30 = 50 cherries together, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's total from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which means he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Since he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday, and he sold 15 boxes on Sunday, he must have sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use. 

She reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce. So, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Since each bottle of sunscreen is 8 ounces, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces) to find out how many bottles she will need.

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

The price of the blue car is $100. To find 40% of this price, we multiply it by 0.4. 

40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, we subtract this discount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car.

Price of red car = Price of blue car - Discount
= $100 - $40
= $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The total cost of both cars is the sum of their prices:
Total cost = Price of blue car + Price of red car
= $100 + $60
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil will be 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

From point 2, we know that when Emil turns 24, his dad will be twice as old as Emil. So, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Now, we need to find the current age of Emil's dad and brother. Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old (since Emil is 19 now and will turn 24 in 5 years). Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend. So, 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down Joe's crawfish catch. On Thursday, he caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

To find the number of cheerleaders or band members, we need to calculate 25% of the remaining 24 students. 
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members. 
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to first figure out how many plants she can fit in her flower bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant is 12 inches wide. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant. To find out how many plants she can fit, we need to subtract the width of the plant (12 inches) and the space between plants (18 inches) from the total length of the flower bed. Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1320 - 30n.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of 18.

"To find the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias. There are 5 baskets, and each basket will have 3 petunias. The cost of each petunia is $3.00. So, the total cost of petunias is 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of sweet potato vines. There are 5 baskets, and each basket will have 2 vines. The cost of each vine is $2.50. So, the total cost of sweet potato vines is 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00.

Now, we add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together to find the total cost. $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Artemis and her father have a 30-pound bag of soil. They plan to use it to plant roses, carnations, and sunflowers. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. They are planting 4 sunflowers, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. So, the total soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, they are planting 10 carnations, and each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. So, the total soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil in total, the amount of soil left for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 roses.

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year to find the total savings in a year: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we need to divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both tasks simultaneously. 

First, let's calculate how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

Since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Next, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to figure out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet and then determine Bill's age at that time.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 

Three times the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is 3 * 30 = 90 years old. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. 

So, Bill's dad was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when Bill was born. 

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, Bill was 30 - 15 = 15 years old when his dad was born.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and add them together.

First, let's consider the regular monthly bills. Buford writes a check for the electric bill once a month, so that's 12 checks per year. He also writes a check for the gas bill once a month, which adds another 12 checks per year.

Next, we have the checks to the church. Buford writes two checks to the church every month, so that's 24 checks per year.

Lastly, we have the quarterly checks to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, Buford writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane. Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

"The three little wolves, Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous, are quite the vocal trio. Let's break down their howling habits. Tobias lets out a 20-second howl each time. Chikote, being the more enthusiastic one, howls for twice as long as Tobias, which means Chikote's howls last 40 seconds.

Now, Igneous is the longest of the three, howling for as long as the other two combined. So, Igneous howls for 20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) = 60 seconds.

To find the total howling time, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60, since there are 60 seconds in a minute: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

First, let's find the total age of Akbar and Alessandro. 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age = 3 + 4 = 7

Since the total age of the children is 20, we can express the total age as:
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20

We are also given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4)

We can simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
7 + (7 + W) + W = 20
14 + 2W = 20
2W = 6
W = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Walter starts by collecting $500 from his neighbors. Then, he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. 

The total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

However, Walter's lawyer will only consider the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, not the $200 donated by his friend. Therefore, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 is still $2000.

To find out how much the lawyer will contribute, we multiply $2000 by 3.

$2000 * 3 = $6000

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we need to first determine the total number of cookies given to the church. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a family of 6, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids. They need to divide a watermelon in such a way that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

To simplify the problem, let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. If each kid gets x units, then each adult gets 2x units, since they get twice as much as each kid.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each). The total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combine like terms: 6x = 100.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

So, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 33.33"
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes
Convert total time from minutes to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Jordan needs 3 hours to make the cake. To be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm, she should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Lisa and Peter sold a total of 64 chocolate bars together. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total earnings per month are $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each. We also know that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars.

To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know there are 9 red sticks. We also know that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

Now, we're told that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

To find the total number of sticks, we need to add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

"To find the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, let's break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the 3000 students are over 16 years old. This means there are 1500 students over 16. Since one-fourth of these students are male, we can find the number of male students over 16 by dividing 1500 by 4, which equals 375. Therefore, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Next, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which also equals 1500 students. Since one-half of these students are male, we can find the number of male students under 16 by dividing 1500 by 2, which equals 750. Therefore, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16, which equals 1125 + 750 = 1875.

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, let's start with Bethany. She can run 10 laps in one hour.

Next, we know that Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany. So, Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Now, Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey. To find out how many laps Shaelyn can run, we need to divide the number of laps Trey can run by 2. Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Finally, Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn. To find out how many laps Quinn can run, we need to subtract 2 from the number of laps Shaelyn can run. Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Maria's power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours, and then it loses 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. We're also given that the final charge remaining is 28%.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

For the next 3 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%. However, we know that the final charge remaining is 28%, so the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

Now, let's find the charge remaining after 8 hours. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 6%, so the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34% - 6% = 28%. This means that the charge remaining after 8 hours is indeed 28%.

Now, let's find the initial charge. We know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 50.71%. The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 50.71% = 4.29%. Since the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour, the charge lost in the first 5 hours is 9% * 5 = 45%. However, we know that the charge lost is 4.29%, not 45%. This means that the initial charge is not 55%.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. We know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. The charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%. Since the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour, the charge lost"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. 20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000) to find out how many weeks she needs to work. 

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruits. He's already bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, 4 pears at $0.5 each, 2 kiwis at $1 each, and 5 apples at $0.75 each.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Now, let's find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining money. Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to determine how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, we need to divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends. There are 10 friends, so each friend received 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are in 1.3 packs. 1 pack has 60 pieces, so 0.3 packs have 0.3 * 60 = 18 pieces.

Therefore, each friend received 60 + 18 = 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first determine the number of pictures in each album. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Since 3 albums were selfies only, the number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums = 5 albums. 
The number of portraits is 5 albums * 9 pictures per album = 45 portraits.

However, we were told that 2 of the albums were portraits. This means the 5 albums of portraits include the 2 portrait albums and 3 other albums. The 3 other albums must be selfies. 

The number of portraits is 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits.

The number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The total number of portraits and selfies is 18 portraits + 27 selfies = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

James reads 18 pages in total. Since he reads 3 pages per set, we divide 18 by 3 to find the number of sets: 18 / 3 = 6 sets.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we multiply the number of sets by the time per set: 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the situation at the hotel. Initially, there were 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so we subtract those as well: 76 - 15 = 61 guests.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. We add these new guests to the remaining count: 61 + 30 = 91 guests.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, bringing the total to 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then find out how many of each she is sure to get.

First, let's find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are in the quiz:
- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36
- Average questions: 36 / 2 = 18
- Difficult questions: 36 / 2 = 18

Now, let's find out how many of each type of question Aries is sure to get:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Since x = 2y, we can substitute this into the equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The family consists of a man who eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife who eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son who eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

So, the total number of sandwiches they eat per day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.

In one week, they eat 11 * 7 = 77 sandwiches.

"Let's break down Suzanne's earnings and expenses to find out how much money she has left.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies:
80 cookies at $1 each is 80 * $1 = $80.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes:
60 cupcakes at $4 each is 60 * $4 = $240.

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes:
$80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings:
$320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 60 eggs. There are 10 eggs that were not found by anyone.

To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we need to subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to first determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

Now, let's calculate how much ore he can mine with a steel pickaxe. A steel pickaxe allows him to mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now that we know one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, we can find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day by multiplying 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2 and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2. 

Since the ratios are the same, the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches will be proportional to the price of the second package. 

The price of the second package is $6 for 4 sandwiches. To find the price per sandwich, we divide the price by the number of sandwiches: 6/4 = 1.5. 

Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: 1.5 * 8 = 12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month for the bedroom set, we need to calculate the remaining balance after he sells his old bedroom set and then determine the monthly interest.

First, let's find out how much Tom still owes after selling his old bedroom set:

Total cost of bedroom set: $3000
Amount paid from selling old bedroom set: $1000
Amount still owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to find out how much Tom has to pay per month. The interest rate is 10% per month, so we need to calculate 10% of the amount still owed:

Amount still owed: $2000
Interest rate: 10% = 0.10
Monthly payment: $2000 * 0.10 = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"Let's break down the situation step by step. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst due to the gust of wind. To find the number of red balloons that burst, we multiply 25 by 0.4, which equals 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 15 red balloons.

Next, the loud sound startled Sally, causing her to release half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 6 yellow balloons.

As Sally approached the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree. She added 75% of these blue balloons to her remaining clutch. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.75, which equals 6. So, Sally added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons Sally has: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. The total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

The probability of not having to turn in his homework is 102% - 100% = 2%. However, this is not possible since the probability cannot be greater than 100%. To find the correct probability, we need to subtract 100% from 102% to get -2% and then add 100% to -2% to get 98%. 

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 98%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to subtract the number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question asks for the number of tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, implying that the remaining tickets are for guests.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we need to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. We're told that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we can set up a proportion.

Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Then, 3x = 150. To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three people who divided an amount of $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first, and the third person took twice what the second took.

Let's denote the share of the first person as x. The second person's share would then be x + 80, and the third person's share would be 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combining like terms, we get: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Simplifying further, we get: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtracting 240 from both sides, we get: 4x = 1680.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 420.

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Rory retrieved tennis balls from three sets, and we need to find out how many he retrieved in the first set.

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car is $20,000, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

= $9,851.68

The final answer is: $9851.68"
"To find the number of Spanish books in the library, we first need to determine the number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so the number of English books is 50 / 2 = 25.
10% of the books are written in German, so the number of German books is 50 * 0.1 = 5.

The total number of books written in English and German is 25 + 5 = 30.
Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 325 kilometers

Distance left to drive = Total distance - Distance driven

"To find out how many gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. 
There are 16 cups in a gallon. 
So, 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Romeo boards a train with 120 people. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's start with the tank top, which costs $10. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.

Next, we have the tennis shoes. They were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. To find the sale price, we divide the original price by 2: $48 / 2 = $24.

Now, let's consider the athletic socks. They cost $8, and Alison had a coupon for $2 off. To find the final cost of the socks, we subtract the coupon value from the original price: $8 - $2 = $6.

Now that we have the cost of each item, we can add them together to find the total amount Alison spent: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find James' increased insurance cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12.

Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. 
They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, so they watch 4 / 2 = 2 movies on Sunday.

In one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

"Let's break down Leo's sticker collection. Two years ago, he had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

To find the total number of stickers Leo has now, we add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 250 = 500 stickers.

The final answer is: 500"
"To determine how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food each cat eats per day. Since Imma feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get the daily consumption per cat: 60 * 2 = 120 grams.

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily consumption per cat (120 grams) to find out how many days it will last: 720 / 120 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 8 * 4 = 32.

We are also given that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Furthermore, Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, which means Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes.

Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Then, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down the expenses. 

First, let's consider the cost of the cast, which is $200. 

Next, we have the doctor's visit, which costs $300 per hour. Since the visit lasted for 30 minutes, we need to calculate the cost for half an hour. To do this, we multiply the hourly rate by 0.5, which gives us $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The patient also needs to pay for 30 painkillers at $4 each, resulting in a total of $4 * 30 = $120.

Lastly, there's the mandatory parking fee, which is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours. This comes out to $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we need to calculate 70% of 20. 

70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and there are 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of coupon. The cost per small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents. The cost per big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. To find out how many he ordered, we need to subtract 3 from 10.

10 - 3 = 7

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

7 * 4 = 28

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, there were 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left. Sidney ordered 3 more sub sandwiches. 

3 + 3 = 6

Now, there are 6 meatball sub sandwiches left. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

6 * 4 = 24

"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

Since Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he needs 6 pounds of butter. 

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, so for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays the full price of $4.00 for one pound and half off for the other pound. 

For 6 pounds of butter, he will need to buy 3 sets of 2 pounds. 

The cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter is:
- 3 sets * $4.00 (full price) = $12.00
- 3 sets * $2.00 (half off) = $6.00
- Total cost for 6 pounds of butter = $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

"To find the total cost of Kayla's party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and multiply it by the cost per guest, then add the initial fee.

First, let's find the total number of guests attending the party. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and the 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members. However, 4 people said they could not come. So, the total number of guests attending is 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. The number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost per additional guest is $6. Therefore, the cost for the additional guests is 21 * 6 = $126.

The initial fee to rent the theater is $125. To find the total cost, we add the cost for the additional guests and the initial fee: $126 + $125 = $251.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending a portion of their money, we can infer that the amount they spent is the difference between their initial and final amounts.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza had as 'x'. Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money, she has 3/4 of her money left, which is $60. This means 3/4 * x = $60. To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4/3, which gives us x = $80.

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, so she has 2/3 of her money left, which is $60. This means 2/3 * x = $60. To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2, which also gives us x = $80.

Now that we know they initially had $80 each, we can find the total amount of money they had: $80 + $80 = $160.

Since they each had $60 after spending a portion of their money, the total amount they spent is $160 - $120 = $40.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the initial amount: $160 - $40 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for his three monkeys, which will last them for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many bananas they eat each day by dividing 315 by 7.

315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day

Now, let's consider the eating habits of the monkeys. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten each day. 

45 (total bananas per day) - 10 (first monkey) - 14 (second monkey) = 45 - 24 = 21 bananas

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"Jenny goes to the florist to buy some flowers. Roses cost $2 each and $15 for a dozen. If she bought 15 roses and arrived with five $5 bills, they only have quarters for change. Let's break this down.

Since Jenny bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen. 15 roses is 1 and 3 roses. 1 dozen is 12 roses, so she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses.

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

"To find the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is:
2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:
1500 * 1.2 = $1800

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price he paid:
2000 - 1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
(200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many bananas Jenny bought in total. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, we multiply the number of bunches by the number of bananas per bunch: 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 bananas individually. The price per banana is $0.80, so we multiply the total number of bananas by the price per banana: 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, we need to find the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, we multiply the number of bunches by the price per bunch: 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"

Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month.

First, we need to find the number of each type of bike sold. We know that Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, which is 300 / 2 = 150. 

Next, we need to find the number of BMX bikes sold. We know that 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so we multiply 300 by 0.15 to get 45.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105.

Now that we know the number of each type of bike sold, we can calculate the total earnings for each type of bike. The price of a Trekking bike is $450, so 150 * $450 = $67,500. The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500, so the price of a BMX bike is $250. Therefore, 45 * $250 = $11,250. The price of an MTB is $500, so 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The farmer is making 5 bales of hay per hour, and the truck is picking up 3 bales per hour. They both work for 6 hours.

First, we need to find out how many bales the farmer makes in 6 hours. To do this, we multiply the number of bales made per hour by the number of hours worked: 5 * 6 = 30.

Next, we need to find out how many bales the truck picks up in 6 hours. We do this by multiplying the number of bales picked up per hour by the number of hours worked: 3 * 6 = 18.

Now, we need to find out how many bales are left in the field. To do this, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and the extra time he dedicates on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total minutes John spends in class. He has 6 periods a day, each lasting 40 minutes, and he attends classes 5 days a week. So, the total minutes for the regular classes are:
6 periods * 40 minutes per period = 240 minutes per day
240 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1200 minutes per week

John also has 2 extra classes, each lasting 40 minutes, and he attends these classes 5 days a week. So, the total minutes for the extra classes are:
2 classes * 40 minutes per class = 80 minutes per day
80 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 400 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes:
1200 minutes per week + 400 minutes per week = 1600 minutes per week

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He dedicates 1/16 of his weekly minutes to learning on these days. 
First, let's find the total minutes in a week: 
7 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 1680 minutes per week
1/16 * 1680 minutes per week = 105 minutes per day
105 minutes per day * 2 days = 210 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes, and the extra minutes for Saturday and Sunday:
1600 minutes per week + 210 minutes per week = 1810 minutes per week

Finally, let's convert the total minutes to hours:
1810 minutes per week / 60 minutes per hour = 30.17 hours per week

The final answer is: 30.17"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

The height of the ball after the first bounce is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child step by step.

First, let's convert the height of the first child to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned from selling apples, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"The tale of the triceratops' demise is a fascinating one. Let's unravel the mystery of its original weight.

We know that a group of lazy Allosaurus devoured the last 270 kilograms of meat. But before they did, a pack of cunning velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. This means the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Now, we must consider the Tyrannosaurus rex's role in this saga. It's clear that the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops' original weight, and the velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex consumed. Therefore, the T-Rex must have eaten 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, we can deduce that the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's break down the situation. Ellen initially had 12 sodas, but she shook 3 of them. This means 3 sodas are shaken and 9 are unshaken. She then took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother came by and took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. This leaves us with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.29}$"
"The problem at hand is quite straightforward. We have two trains departing from a station in opposite directions. One train is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour, while the other is traveling at half that distance per hour, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and add them together. 

The first train, traveling at 60 miles per hour, will cover a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles in 3 hours.

The second train, traveling at 30 miles per hour, will cover a distance of 30 * 3 = 90 miles in 3 hours.

Now, to find the total distance between the two trains, we simply add the distances covered by each train: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many people Billy helps, we first need to determine the total number of days he is available to help. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, multiply the number of days Billy helps by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he helps: 
40 * 6 = 240

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present. However, the question does not provide the total number of people present, so we will assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since we are assuming that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported, the number of people inside the church is equal to the number of people transported.

The final answer is: 480"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to first determine Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can subtract 4 from Mike's age to find Martha's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age, as Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.
The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, let's break down the transactions step by step.

First, Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. Then, she returned one item that cost $15.00. This means we need to subtract the cost of the returned item from the initial charge.

Initial charge: $85.00
Return: -$15.00
New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. We calculate the discount in the same way.

Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the new balance.

Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

Finally, we add the total cost of the new purchases to the previous balance.

New balance: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"The jellyfish tank is quite an intriguing place. Let's dive into the problem at hand. We're told that a fifth of the jellyfish in the tank are large, and a third of those large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

Let's break this down step by step. If a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can represent the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. This means the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

Now, a third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We're given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation x/15 = 6 to find the total number of jellyfish in the tank.

Solving for x, we get x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

The final answer is: 90"

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement and then determine how many years it will take her to save that amount.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, her annual savings will be:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

Next, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary in retirement, her annual retirement income will be:

Annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

Total savings needed = Annual retirement income * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Now, we need to calculate how many years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of $20,000 per year:

Number of years = Total savings needed / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can calculate the total number of students by dividing the number of boys by the decimal equivalent of 40%.

40% as a decimal is 0.4. 

Now, let's divide the number of boys by this decimal: 240 / 0.4 = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 4 workers who produce toys at different rates. Two workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work for 10 hours.

First, let's find the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers in 10 hours. The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. 

The total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 10 hours is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. The fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys, which is 420 - 200 = 220 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour is 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie the albatross to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that would be 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to cover this distance. Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can divide the total distance (20,000 km) by the distance he flies per day (400 km) to find out how many days it will take him to fly that distance.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so its speed is 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find the speed of the fastest car. We're told that it's 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find its speed, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25: 600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Since two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, we can determine Vince's age two years ago by dividing Liam's age at that time by 2. So, Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so we can denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A and Madeline as M, and we can say A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so we can denote the number of eggs painted by Camden as C and Sarah as S, and we can say C + S = 30.

Furthermore, we know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so we can say C = S + 12.

Now, let's solve for S. We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S + 12 + S = 30, which simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them into boxes, with each box holding 8 crayons. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of it, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, we divide 64 by 4 to find the number of logs, as each log is 4 feet.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.
2. Valerie's brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, so her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.
3. Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so their mother earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.
5. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

"Let's break down Grandma's walking routine. She covers 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach is given as 40 minutes. 

To find her speed on the beach, we can use the formula distance/speed = time. So, 2 miles / x miles per minute = 40 minutes. Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"Let's break down Jane's savings. She has been saving $4 of her allowance every week for 8 weeks. To find out how much she has saved so far, we multiply her weekly savings by the number of weeks:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she continues to save $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

"Let's break down the information given. We have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, and 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

First, let's calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees with 7 birds each: 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we'll calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees with 4 birds each: 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.

Now, we add the number of blue birds in the tree with 3 birds: 8 blue birds.

Finally, we add the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to understand that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 + 24 = 84 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles. Let's call the number of marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles 'x'. Then, x + 24 = 84. To find 'x', we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 84 - 24 = 60.

Now that we know Bob has 60 marbles before receiving 2 dozen more marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 60: 60 - 10 = 50.

"The problem at hand is quite intriguing. Donny, it seems, has a rather specific requirement for his water temperature. He can only drink it if it's at least 40 degrees. 

Let's break down the situation: Donny has two mugs of water, one of which is 33 degrees. He pours 4 ounces from this mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other, unknown temperature mug. This combination allows him to drink the water.

To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the average temperature of the two mugs after the transfer. The average temperature is calculated by adding the temperatures of the two mugs and dividing by 2. Since Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other, the average temperature is (33 + x) / 2, where x is the temperature of the second mug.

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average temperature multiplied by the total ounces, which is 5 ounces in this case. Therefore, the total temperature is (33 + x) / 2 * 5.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40.

Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 / 2 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 >= 80
165 + 5x >= 80
5x >= 80 - 165
5x >= -85
x >= -85 / 5
x >= -17

However, since x represents a temperature, it cannot be negative. Therefore, the minimum value of x is 40 degrees.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. We need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately after three weeks.

First, let's find the number of cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 21 days in three weeks, the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows. Adding this to the initial 50 cows, we get 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows.

Next, let's find the number of chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. The total number of chickens added in three weeks is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens. Adding this to the initial 20 chickens, we get 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.

Now, we add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks. Total number of animals = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to first calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels. Each pack costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in it. 

Total cost of 4 packs = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the total cost.
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00
Discounted cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
Number of bagels in one pack = 9
Total number of bagels in 4 packs = 4 * 9 = 36

To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels.
Cost of each single bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many scoops he ate, we need to subtract 5 from 23. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we're told that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's find out how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 

1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, it takes 3 * 2 = 6 potatoes to make 6 scoops. 

To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to find out how many groups of 6 scoops are in 18 scoops. 18 / 6 = 3.

So, Gomer ate 3 * 6 = 18 potatoes.

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquet per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to get the number of bouquets sold per day.

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 12 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets.

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Next, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold per day from the individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from the sunflowers per day, we can divide $26 by $2 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day.

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can add the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam has $100 to invest in his rock stand. He buys rocks for $5 each and sells them for $7 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * $5 = $100

However, since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 + $40 = $140

Since Adam only made $84 from selling the rocks, we subtract the revenue from the total cost to find out how much money he loses:

$140 - $84 = $56

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

   Solving for C, we get C = 22.

2. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as R. Then, Carlos collected 2R seashells.
   We already know that Carlos collected 22 seashells, so we can write the equation: 2R = 22.

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2.

"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the total number of face masks he uses in a day. Since he changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2.

6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. To find the total number of eggs hidden, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's consider the number of eggs found by each person. Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs found, we add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of apartments. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree first. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. 

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000, x = 1200. 

So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 0 + 1000 = 1550

The final answer is: 1550"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find out how much money that is, we need to divide $100 by 5.

$100 / 5 = $20

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, we need to add this amount to Jack's initial $100.

$100 + $20 = $120

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three ropes: red, blue, and yellow. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. We know that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can express the combined length of the ropes as R + B + Y = 37. Substituting R = 4B into this equation, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Now, substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37. This gives us 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37. Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12. Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. If Ronnie was given $5, then Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.
(15 - x) = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given about the wall mural. We know there are four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, which means the total amount of these three colors is three times the amount of one of them. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint.

Given that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow, the other half is 6 pints. This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, we can represent the amount of each of these colors as x. Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. 
Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3160}$"
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To determine how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days he can use the chalk after Monday.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of girls by 1/3. The total number of girls is 12, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.

Next, we need to find the number of boys on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of boys by 1/4. The total number of boys is 12, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

Now that we have the number of girls and boys on varsity, we can find the total number of students on varsity by adding these two numbers together. The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class. The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24. Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. James has 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. 

First, we need to find the number of teeth the dentist caps. Since the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, and he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth he caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we need to find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. This is the sum of the teeth he drills and the teeth he caps, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, and then multiply by 100. So, (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is 50%.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given two pieces of information about Wendy and Colin's ages. Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples. Total apples = 1 (in pocket) + 5 (new) = 6.
3. He put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 5 apples in his pocket. Total apples = 1 (outside) + 5 (in pocket) = 6.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples. Total apples = 6 (from previous step) + 6 (new) = 12.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, so he now has 12 apples in total.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples."
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to calculate the number of bags of coal he ordered and multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, let's determine the number of bags. Since the coal is delivered in 50 kg bags, we divide the total weight of coal by the weight per bag:

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, we know the cost per bag is $18. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat, and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. To find out how many snowballs he builds per minute, we divide 20 by 60, which gives us 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, we also need to consider that 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which they melt, we divide 2 by 15, which gives us 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, let's find the net rate of snowballs by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate: (1/3) - (2/15). To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15. So, we convert 1/3 to 5/15. Now we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3, which gives us 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how long it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. To do this, we divide the number of snowballs by the rate: 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 50 / 2 = 25).
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages (since they ordered 1 pack of 50).
After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages.
After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100 bandages (since they ordered 2 packs of 50).

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

"To calculate Jen's total earnings, we need to consider her regular pay and attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April. Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

First, we need to find the cost per bottle of scotch. Since John buys 10 bottles for $600, the cost per bottle is $600 / 10 = $60.

Next, we know that John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which means he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

Now, we can find the total cost of the cognac by multiplying the cost per bottle by the number of bottles: 20 * $90 = $1800.

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total cost: $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Lodgepole Pine: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the events and calculate the remaining root beer.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, his wife accidentally spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, his friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Now, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of people.

8 gallons / 3 people = 2.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40. This can be written as an equation: 4x + 8 = 40, where x represents the number of coffee mugs.

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish in the tank.

One-third of 66 = 66 / 3 = 22

Now, let's find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. We'll subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

Total fish = 66
Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish without red stripes = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44

Next, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish.

5/11 of 44 = (5/11) * 44 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes.

Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish with blue stripes = 20
Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the situation. Amy initially had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, which gives her a total of 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had three makeup sets, each containing six eyeshadow colors, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister then stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Next, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of that is 3. So, she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"Let's break down the information given about Mattison's house. We know that Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, which means the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Now, we're told that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

To find the height of the second floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Since we're interested in the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to find the height of the roof above the second floor. This is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

The final answer is: 180"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 700 shells in total, and team Alphas found 40% of them. To find 40% of 700, we multiply 0.4 by 700.

0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. 

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs. The first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second needs to walk 4 miles, and the third needs to walk 3 miles. 

So, the total miles walked by the first three dogs is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, the total miles walked by all 4 dogs should be 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, to find the miles walked by the last dog, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all 4 dogs: 
12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

The last dog needs 4 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find out how much John borrowed, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house, which is worth $250,000.

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

He used 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To find out how much money he had leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the amount borrowed.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's calculate Deandre's earnings from selling the tunas. 

The first tuna he caught weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

To find the total weight of the tunas, we need to add the weights of all three tunas. 

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 
The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.  Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day.  Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.  Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

The total amount of water removed is 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many balloons were thrown during Jolene's water balloon fight, we need to calculate the total number of balloons and then subtract the number of balloons left.

First, we find the total number of balloons: 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.

Then, we subtract the number of balloons left: 300 - 12 = 288.

So, they threw 288 balloons during the water balloon fight.

The final answer is: 288"
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the capacity of John's classes, we need to find 1/8 of Ali's class capacity. 

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. 
1/8 of 120 is 120 / 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 
Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

The final answer is: 150"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. 

First, we need to calculate the interest he owes. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

Now, we need to find the remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. This is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's break down the problem. Jordan has 2 children, and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day. So, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. This means Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume. 

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are told that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed. 

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total number of people 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Pauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. Initially, the cost of one visit is $2. 

For the first 5 years, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. To find the total cost for these 5 years, we multiply the annual cost by 5: 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's consider the cost increase. The cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

To find the total cost for all visits, we add the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

There are 4 grades at Cedar Falls Middle School (grades 4-7), and each grade has 10 students. So, the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many groups can be formed: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, and there are 5 groups, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Ian has a 40-foot board and he wants to make a cut so he can have two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine how much of Aiden's secret seasoning he needs, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total seasoning needed.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be x, then the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation:
x + 3x - 2 = 10
4x - 2 = 10
4x = 12
x = 3

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance covered = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the distance covered, we'll divide the distance covered by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, and then multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is 36 / 12 = 3 pies.

Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) + 36 (by their mother) = 102 grapes.

The total cost of the macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00 per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to determine the total time they have to clean and the total time it takes to clean all the classrooms.

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task. Since they work 8 hours a day, the total time they have is 5 * 8 = 40 hours.

The total time it takes to clean all 80 classrooms is 80 * 15 minutes = 1200 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1200 / 60 = 20 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 / 40) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase: 
Middle shelf 1 + Middle shelf 2 + Bottom shelf + Top shelf = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are needed to hold all of them. To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 
110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost of the eggs. Since she bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen, we multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen.

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's determine how many sets of 3 eggs Rose can sell. 

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since she sells each set for $1, the total revenue will be:

20 sets * $1/set = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Mary makes some strawberry cubes and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes in total, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We know that B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B into the second equation, we get S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"The power goes out in Brianna's house, and her family is preparing for the night ahead. They have a total of 8 rooms in their house and 4 people living there, including Brianna. Each person has a flashlight, so the total number of flashlights is 4.

Now, let's consider the candles. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since there are 8 rooms, half of them is 4. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have five phones on a phone plan, and the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. The main phone plan costs $20.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Conor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun. On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were present at the beach than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, which is 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people he saw on the first three days to the number of people he saw on the remaining days: 260 + 240 = 500.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with popcorn popping at different rates over a series of 30-second intervals.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 

In the next 30 seconds, the rate triples, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, the rate quadruples, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the rate halves, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make. He's planning to make 4 gallons for the party, and his friend Allen asked him to make an extra gallon that's twice as tart as the others. So, the total amount of lemonade is 4 + 1 = 5 gallons.

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many cups of juice are needed for 5 gallons. 

Total cups of juice = 5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade. This lemonade is twice as tart as the other gallons, which means it requires twice the amount of lemon juice. 

Extra tart lemonade cups = 1 gallon * 2 = 2 cups

Total lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade = 2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons

Total lemons needed for the regular lemonade = 5 cups - 2 cups = 3 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 3/6 * 6 = 3 lemons

Total lemons needed = 2 lemons (for the extra tart lemonade) + 3 lemons (for the regular lemonade) = 5 lemons

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed they eat per day is 5 * 8 = 40 pounds.

In a week, there are 7 days, so the total amount of feed they eat in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the amount eaten from the total amount ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party.

John invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs required is:
20 * 2 = 40

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. To find out how many hot dogs he needs to buy, we subtract the leftover hot dogs from the total required:
40 - 4 = 36

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:
36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
6 * 2 = 12

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down Frances' sales and expenses. She sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each, which gives her a total of 20 * $2 = $40. Additionally, she sells 40 cookies at $1 each, resulting in 40 * $1 = $40. Her total earnings from both cupcakes and cookies are $40 + $40 = $80.

Frances also buys five trays at $4 each, which amounts to 5 * $4 = $20. To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract her total expenses from her total earnings: $80 - $20 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

At the end of the first street, there are 5 children. 

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

The original 5 children then leave the group, so we subtract 5 from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mamou has volunteered to distribute 1,360 meals to the affected families. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. To find out how many meals she has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

First, let's calculate the total number of meals given out:
64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) = 94
94 + 48 (Sunday) = 142

Now, let's subtract the total number of meals given out from the total number of meals Mamou has:
1,360 (total meals) - 142 (meals given out) = 1,218

So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

"Let's break down the information given. We have 2 brothers and 3 sisters in the family. The sisters are all the same age, which is 16 years old. One of the brothers is 12 years old, and this is half the age of the older brother.

Since one brother is 12 years old, the older brother must be twice as old, which makes him 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

Now, let's calculate the total age of the sisters. Since there are 3 sisters and each is 16 years old, their total age is 3 * 16 = 48 years.

Next, we need to find the total age of the brothers. We already know one brother is 12 years old, and the other is 24 years old. So, the total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36 years.

To find the total age of all the siblings, we add the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters. This gives us 48 + 36 = 84 years.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

Meditation time per day is 30 minutes (15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night). Since Charisma meditates 7 days a week, the total meditation time per week is 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

Yoga time per day is 60 minutes, and Charisma practices yoga 5 days a week. So, the total yoga time per week is 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week.

In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga is 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. Then, we add this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

Now, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower to find the total number of seeds: 36 + 54 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that George has 18 pens. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has by multiplying 18 by 3. 

18 * 3 = 54

Now, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can calculate the number of pens Sarah has by dividing the number of pens Timothy has by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Albert is 36"" tall, and Anne is twice the size of Albert. To find Anne's height, we multiply Albert's height by 2.

Anne's height = 2 * 36"" = 72""

Now, we know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne. To find Jackie's height, we subtract 2"" from Anne's height.

Jackie's height = 72"" - 2"" = 70""

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before summer.

Jackie's height before summer = 70"" - 3"" = 67""

The final answer is: 67"
"To find out how much money the company receives for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced and then multiply it by the price per bar.

In one day, the company produces 5000 bars. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, the company produces 5000 * 7 = 35000 bars.

In two weeks, the company produces 35000 * 2 = 70000 bars.

"To find out how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many days it takes to fill them. 

First, let's find the total number of holes dug by the dog. Since the dog digs 6 holes a day and Nate is on vacation for 14 days, we multiply the number of holes dug per day by the number of days.

Holes dug per day = 6
Days Nate was on vacation = 14
Total holes dug = 6 * 14 = 84

However, the dog also digs 6 new holes every night, so we need to add these to the total holes dug during the day. Since Nate fills the holes for the same number of days he was on vacation, we'll add the holes dug at night to the total holes.

Holes dug at night = 6 * 14 = 84
Total holes = 84 + 84 = 168

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 / 3
Days to fill holes = 56

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7.

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 8

"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Average enrollment at Norman High School: 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School: 4000 * (3/4) = 3000 students

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in enrollment: 4000 - 3000 = 1000

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: This statement is incorrect, but we can infer that Igor gathered 2 more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested. So, if he gathered 2 more test tubes than Petri dishes, then he gathered 14 - 2 = 12 Petri dishes.
- Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 12 Petri dishes = 27 items.

Since Igor had 29 items on the lab bench, he must have lost 29 - 27 = 2 beakers.

"Let's analyze the situation. Aaron and Vanessa are relay race partners, and we know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa. This means if Aaron runs a certain distance in a given time, Vanessa will take twice as long to run the same distance.

We're also told that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, this means Aaron ran half the distance, which is 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

Now, we're given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile by first determining how long it takes Aaron to run 1 mile. 

If Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to run 1 mile by dividing 16 by 2:
16 / 2 = 8 minutes

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, it takes Vanessa twice as long to run 1 mile. Therefore, it takes Vanessa 2 * 8 = 16 minutes to run 1 mile.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can multiply the time it takes her to run 1 mile by 4 to find the total time it took her to complete her part of the race:
16 * 4 = 64 minutes

However, this is not the correct answer. We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and we know that Aaron ran half the distance in 16 minutes. This means that Aaron's time is half of Vanessa's time. Therefore, Vanessa's time is twice Aaron's time. 

So, Vanessa's time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes.

He already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total amount needed: 
600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's find the daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. So, the daily revenue is calculated as follows:

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5) + $5 (bottle of wine) = (2 * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days they are open:

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * Number of days open = $15 * 2 = $30

"To find the cost of each watermelon, we need to first find the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

The profit percentage is 25%, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit). 

The cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Let's find the cost price of 1 watermelon: 
Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

Now, let's find the selling price of 1 watermelon:
Selling price of 50 watermelons = 125% of $80
Selling price of 50 watermelons = (125/100) * $80 = $100
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John had James when he was 19. This implies that the time that has passed since then is 18 - 19 = -1 year. However, since age cannot be negative, this means that John must have had James after he was 19. This is a contradiction, so the information given is inconsistent.

However, if we ignore the inconsistency and continue with the problem, we can find the current age of John's youngest son. John was 32 when his youngest son was born, so his youngest son's current age is 32. In 3 years, his age will be 32 + 3 = 35 years.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, and Jane spends 4 minutes doing the same. To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each of them can peel in an hour.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 60 by the time it takes Ana to peel an orange, which is 3 minutes. This gives us 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour. We can divide 60 by the time it takes Jane to peel an orange, which is 4 minutes. This gives us 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges peeled by Jane from the number of oranges peeled by Ana: 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

Therefore, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

"Let's break down the costs for Mark's new radiator. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400, and Mark gets an 80% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original cost by the discount percentage: 400 * 0.8 = $320. 

Now, subtract the discount from the original cost to get the discounted price: 400 - 320 = $80.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * 50 = $150.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost: 80 + 150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals on his farm, and they are all either chickens or cows. We also know that the total number of legs is 70.

Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can set up the following equation: 2C + 4W = 70.

We also know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can set up another equation: C + W = 20.

Now, let's solve for W in the second equation: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the first equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

Therefore, the number of chickens on the farm is 5.
