"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she has left after using some for breakfast and baking.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She uses 7 eggs for breakfast and baking (3 for breakfast and 4 for muffins). 

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 

To find the total amount she makes, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber required. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. 

Since half of 2 is 1, the robe requires 1 bolt of white fiber. 

Now, we add the blue and white fiber together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

The total number of bolts required is 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the new value, we can use the formula: New value = Original value + (Original value * Percentage increase)
New value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon. 

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time. 

Let's find the common ratio between the costs of the glasses. The ratio is 0.6. 

Now, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to find the total cost of the glasses: 

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = $5, r = 0.6, and n = 16. 

S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)
S = $5 * (1 - 0.00006103515625) / 0.4
S = $5 * 0.99993896484375 / 0.4
S = $5 * 2.49959726671875
S = $12.4974863345625

However, this is the sum of the costs of the glasses, excluding the first glass. To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the first glass: 

Total cost = $5 + $12.4974863345625
Total cost â‰ˆ $17.4974863345625

The total cost is approximately $17.50."
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to start with the number of sheep in Seattle, which is given as 20. 

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we multiply 20 by 4 to find the number of sheep in Charleston: 20 * 4 = 80.

Next, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. To find the number of sheep in Toulouse, we multiply the number of sheep in Charleston by 2: 80 * 2 = 160.

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle to find the total: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To determine the total time it takes to download the file, we need to consider the interruptions and restarts. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

During this time, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. This means Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

However, since Carla has to restart the download from the beginning after the 20-minute update, we need to add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file again:
Time to download 80 GB again = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 40 minutes + 60 minutes = 160 minutes

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each segment of his trip and then determine the remaining distance.

1. Distance traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

2. Distance traveled in the first 2 hours of the return trip in standstill traffic:
Distance = Speed * Time
Since he is not moving, the distance is 0 miles.

3. Distance traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

4. Distance traveled in the remaining 2 hours of the return trip at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 160 = 175 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled in the 4 hours:
Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles
Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

However, since John is now back home, we need to consider the time he spent driving and the time he spent in standstill traffic. The 4 hours include the 3 hours of driving away and the 1 hour of driving back (2 hours of standstill traffic + 0.5 hours of driving at 30 mph + 1 hour of driving at 80 mph).

To find the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he would have traveled if he had driven the entire 4 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 4
Distance = 240 miles

Since John actually traveled 355 miles, the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours is:
Distance from home = Total distance traveled - Distance traveled in 4 hours at 60 mph
Distance from home = 355 - 240
Distance from home = 115 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{115}$"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours. 

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 * $10 = $400. 

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

First, we start with 60 downloads in the first month.

In the second month, the number of downloads is three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it's 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

Now, let's calculate the downloads for the third month. We need to reduce the second month's downloads by 30%. To do this, we find 30% of 180, which is 0.3 * 180 = 54. Then, we subtract this from 180 to get the third month's downloads: 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost of the pastries, we need to calculate the cost of each type and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen is 3 * 68 = $204.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen is 2 * 80 = $160.

Then, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen is 6 * 55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To determine when Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to perform a break-even analysis. The break-even point is the point at which the total revenue equals the total cost.

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the annual cost to maintain the tree is $3. The revenue generated each year is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year.

The total cost is $90 + $3x (since the annual cost is $3 per year), and the total revenue is $10.5x (since the revenue is $10.5 per year).

To find the break-even point, we set the total cost equal to the total revenue and solve for 'x':

$90 + $3x = $10.5x

Subtract $3x from both sides:

$90 = $7.5x

Divide both sides by $7.5:

x = $90 / $7.5
x = 12

This means it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself. However, since the tree will start generating revenue in the first year, it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's dive into the problem. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we need to find out how many she started with.

Let's start by considering the information given. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and she sold half of what was left at the orange house, then she must have had 10 vacuum cleaners before selling at the orange house (since 5 is half of 10).

Now, let's work backwards. If she had 10 vacuum cleaners before selling at the orange house, and she sold half of what was left at the orange house, then she must have had 20 vacuum cleaners before selling at the red house (since 10 is half of 20).

Before selling at the red house, she sold 2 vacuum cleaners, so she must have had 22 vacuum cleaners before selling at the red house (20 + 2).

Before selling at the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with ""x"". Since she had 22 vacuum cleaners before selling at the red house, and she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, we can set up the equation: x - x/3 = 22.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction: 3x - x = 66.

Combine like terms: 2x = 66.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the best investment option for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each item.

For the jewelry, a 2.5% increase in value means the merchant will gain 2.5% of $5,000. 
2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets, a 1.2% increase in value means the merchant will gain 1.2% of $8,000. 
1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Comparing the potential gains, the jewelry option offers a higher increase in value, making it the better choice for the merchant.

The profit from the chosen option is $125."
"When two trains travel in different directions, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance covered. In this case, the trains travel 80 miles westward and 150 miles northward.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we can use the formula:

Total distance = âˆš(horizontal^2 + vertical^2)
Total distance = âˆš(80^2 + 150^2)
Total distance = âˆš(6400 + 22500)
Total distance = âˆš28900
Total distance = 170 miles

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching: 
- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 35 * 50 = 1750
- Annual earnings from teaching: 1750 * $20 = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching: 
- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 15 * 50 = 750
- Annual earnings from coaching: 750 * $30 = $22,500

"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time frame.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, we multiply the number of days by the number of eggs per day: 28 days * 3 eggs/day = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed at which Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Marissa has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. 
2. To find the total time she needs to complete the hike, we can divide the total distance by her desired average speed:
   Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
   Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
   Total time = 3 hours
3. Since she has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.
4. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.
5. To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:
   Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
   Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
   Speed = 6 mph

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink, then subtract the amount of water in the spilled 1 liter of orange drink.

First, let's find the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since it is two-thirds water, we can calculate this as (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Next, let's find the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since it is three-fifths water, we can calculate this as (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink. 
The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract the amount of water in the spilled 1 liter of orange drink. 
The amount of water in the spilled 1 liter of orange drink is (2/3) * 1 = 2/3 = 0.67 liters.

Now, we subtract the amount of water in the spilled 1 liter of orange drink from the total amount of water. 
The remaining amount of water is 15.67 - 0.67 = 15 liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. 
Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, and we have 15 liters of water, the remaining amount of non-water liquid is 24 - 15 = 9 liters.

To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the amount of water in the 9 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. 
Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9 = 3 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9 = 3.6 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 + 3 + 3.6 = 21.6 liters.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation that represents the total cost of the items Marie purchased. Let's denote the number of boxes of pizza as 'x'.

The total cost of the chicken meal is $12, the total cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 = $15, and the total cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 = $6. The total cost of the pizza boxes is $8.50x.

The total amount Marie paid is $50, so we can set up the equation:

12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

33 + 8.50x = 50

Subtract 33 from both sides of the equation:

8.50x = 17

Divide both sides of the equation by 8.50 to solve for x:

x = 17 / 8.50
x = 2

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To determine the total cost of ice cream, we need to calculate the number of cartons Cynthia buys and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night for 60 days, we need to find out how many cartons she will need. Each carton contains 15 servings. 

To find the total number of cartons, we divide the total number of days (60) by the number of servings per carton (15):
60 Ã· 15 = 4

Now that we know Cynthia needs 4 cartons, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton ($4.00):

"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

We know that Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles.

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop. To do this, we can subtract the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that Gloria has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much.

Let's denote the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. Since it costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, we can express it as H = 2 * 33 = $66.

Now, we know that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. We can represent this as an equation: 33 + H - 5 = B, where B is the cost of the boots.

Substituting the value of H, we get 33 + 66 - 5 = B.

Simplifying the equation, we get 94 = B.

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $94.

The final answer is: $94"
"Given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a constant.

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one: 80 / 2 = 40, 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: 80 * 0.25 = 20, 80 + 20 = 100.

The total number of guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30, and the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

We can rewrite the second equation as S + (S + 30) = 110, which simplifies to 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 2S = 80.

Dividing both sides by 2 yields S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and use algebraic expressions to represent the relationships between the variables.

Let's denote the number of jewels Raymond has as R, the number of jewels Aaron has as A, and the number of jewels Siobhan has as S.

Given information:
- R = 40 (Raymond has 40 jewels)
- A = R + 5 (Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels)
- S = A - 2 (Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron)

Now, let's substitute the value of R into the equation for A:
A = R + 5
A = 40 + 5
A = 45

Next, substitute the value of A into the equation for S:
S = A - 2
S = 45 - 2
S = 43

Therefore, Siobhan has 43 jewels.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which equals 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total cost of yogurts over 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of yogurts consumed.

Terry eats 2 yogurts per day. Over 30 days, he consumes 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since the yogurts are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per set: 60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set: 15 sets * $5.00 per set = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets:
13 Lego sets * $15 each = 13 * 15 = $195

Next, we need to find out how much money John spent on video games:
8 video games * $20 each = 8 * 20 = $160

Now, we know John had $5 left after buying the video games. This means he spent a total of $195 - $5 = $190 on video games and his own money.

Since John spent $190 in total, and $160 was spent on video games, he must have used $190 - $160 = $30 of his own money to buy the video games.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $30:
$30 / $15 per Lego set = 2

This means John sold 2 Lego sets with his own money. Since he started with 13 Lego sets, he must have sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 11 Lego sets left."
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours on the first day. For the other two days, he runs half as much, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time.
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half of her running speed. This means her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can set up the equation:

6 = 4x

where x is her walking speed. Solving for x, we get:

x = 6 / 4
x = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Let's denote the total time as t. Then, the time she spends walking is 2/3t and the time she spends running is 1/3t.

We are given that the total time is 6 hours, so we can set up the equation:

2/3t + 1/3t = 6

Combine like terms:

t = 6

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time she spends walking and running:

Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours
Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours

The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"The art of multiplication is a beautiful thing. Let's apply it to this problem. We have three iPhones, each with a different age.

Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. This is our starting point.

Now, let's consider Ben's iPhone. It's two times older than Suzy's iPhone. To find Ben's iPhone age, we multiply Suzy's age by 2: 1 * 2 = 2 years.

Now, let's move on to Brandon's iPhone. It's four times as old as Ben's iPhone. To find Brandon's iPhone age, we multiply Ben's age by 4: 2 * 4 = 8 years.

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while still hitting it with the javelin, we need to consider the increased range of the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

The original range of the javelin is 400 feet, but with the gemstone, it triples. 

Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, we need to find the distance outside this range. 

Distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To find the number of pieces taken by the guests, we first need to determine the total number of pieces available. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each into 8 pieces, we multiply the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie.

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

Now, we need to find out how many pieces were taken by the guests. To do this, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 pieces (total) - 14 pieces (remaining) = 26 pieces

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can still consume, we first need to calculate the remaining calories you can have for the day. Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you've already consumed 1800 calories. 

Remaining calories: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we can find out how many servings you can still have by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams you can eat, multiply the number of servings you can still have by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"To calculate Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we need to determine the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Since Charlie sells each candle for $2.00 and he makes and sells 20 candles, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 per pound * 2, which equals $20.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

First, let's find the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, we need to calculate 2/5 of 5, which is (2 * 5) / 5 = 10 / 5 = 2. Then, we add this to the number of articles she wrote on Monday, which is 5. So, the total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5 + 2 = 7.

Next, we find the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday. Since she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday by 2, which is 7 * 2 = 14.

Now, we add up the number of articles she wrote each day: 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Finally, we multiply the total number of articles by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours) to find the total number of hours spent writing articles: 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased. Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She then purchased a package of Post-it notes and used 220 of them at work. After that, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

Let's represent the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'. The total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package can be expressed as the sum of the initial Post-it notes, the Post-it notes in the package, minus the Post-it notes used, plus the Post-it notes remaining.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of blue ties, the number of red ties, and their respective costs.

Let's denote the number of blue ties as B and the number of red ties as R. We know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so R = 2B.

The cost of each blue tie is $40, and the cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, which is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

We are given that John spent $200 on blue ties. This can be represented as 40B = 200.

Solving for B, we get B = 200 / 40 = 5.

Now that we know the number of blue ties, we can find the number of red ties using the relationship R = 2B, which gives us R = 2 * 5 = 10.

The total cost of blue ties is 40 * 5 = $200, and the total cost of red ties is 60 * 10 = $600.

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply 4 feet by 12 to get the total length in inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces obtained.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

"To find the total number of units in the building, we first calculate the total number of units by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor: 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4: 120 units * 1/4 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens are produced per week:
1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To determine the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spent traveling back.

The distance from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours. Since Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, the distance is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

The time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour is 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Now, we need to find the time it took to travel back. The distance is the same, 30 miles. Since Tom's ship can travel at 6 mph, the time it took to travel back is 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

The total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove from his book bag. We know that his comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and he removed 30 comic books. 

First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of toys Uriah needs to remove. Since he needs to remove a total of 15 pounds and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can calculate the number of toys to be removed by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

To find the revenue earned on Friday, we need to calculate the revenue from car tires only since no truck tires were repaired.

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the two different periods of her pension.

For the first 10 years, she receives the full annual pension of $50,000. 

For the remaining 20 years, she is entitled to 5% of the value of the pension. To find the value of the pension, we multiply the annual pension by the number of years she receives the full pension: $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000.

Now, we need to find 5% of the value of the pension, which is 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000/year.

To find her annual pension after 30 years, we add the annual pension for the first 10 years to the annual pension for the remaining 20 years: $50,000/year + $25,000/year = $75,000/year.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to determine the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The initial monthly charge is $140. For the first half of the year, which consists of 6 months, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount. To find 10% of $140, we multiply $140 by 0.1, which equals $14. Then, we subtract this amount from the initial charge to get 90% of $140, which is $140 - $14 = $126.

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To find the initial amount of money Bailey had, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. 

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she receives from her allowance is $5 * 8 = $40. At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100.

We can set up the equation as follows:

x + 40 = 100

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

"To find the average square footage of a level in the sandcastle, we need to calculate the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can consider this a geometric series with the first term (a) as 16 and the common ratio (r) as 1/2.

The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 16, r = 1/2, and n = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
S = 16 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) * 2
S = 15

Now, to find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 15 / 4 = 3.75.

"To determine the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in that time period.

First, we calculate the amount of dog food the puppy eats in the first 180 days. Since the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for 180 days, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

Next, we calculate the amount of dog food the puppy eats for the rest of the year. Since the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for 185 days (365 - 180 = 185), the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

Now, we add the amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days and the amount eaten in the rest of the year to find the total amount of dog food eaten in the first year: 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we divide the total amount of dog food eaten in the first year by the number of cups in a bag to find the total number of bags used: 550 / 110 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the amount of laundry done by Raymond, Sarah, and David.

Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as D, the amount Sarah does as S, and the amount Raymond does as R.

We are given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so S = 4D.

We are also given that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so R = S/2.

Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can substitute S = 400 into the equation S = 4D to find D:
400 = 4D
D = 400 / 4
D = 100

Now that we know D, we can find S and R:
S = 4D
S = 4 * 100
S = 400

R = S/2
R = 400 / 2
R = 200

Now, let's find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

"To determine the better price for buying 18 flowers, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation: W + L = 22.

We also know that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write the equation: W = L + 8.

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

W + L = 22
W = L + 8

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for L. Replacing W with L + 8 in the first equation, we get:

L + 8 + L = 22

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7

Now that we know L, we can find W by substituting L into one of the original equations. Using W = L + 8, we get:

W = 7 + 8
W = 15

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to apply the 10% annual increase to her initial salary for a total of 8 years.

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount (initial salary), r is the annual increase rate (10% or 0.1), and n is the number of years.

Initial salary (P) = $600
Annual increase rate (r) = 10% or 0.1
Number of years (n) = 8

We will apply the 10% increase for 8 years. The formula becomes:
A = $600(1 + 0.1)^8

Calculating the value:
A = $600(1.1)^8
A â‰ˆ $600 * 1.85099
A â‰ˆ $1110.99

"To find the total number of gift bags needed, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

16 (total guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we first calculate the amount eaten by adults. Since each adult eats 10 pounds, and there are 20 adults, the total amount eaten by adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount eaten by children. Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is 10 / 2 = 5 pounds. With 5 children, the total amount eaten by children is 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts eaten by adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's analyze the given information:

Cindy has 4 pets. 
Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"Let's analyze the given information:

We have four pieces of information:

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
4. We are asked to find Jackson's age.

From the first piece of information, we can write an equation for Corey's age in terms of James' age: Corey = James + 1. Since James is 10, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

From the second piece of information, we can write an equation for Amy's age in terms of Corey's age: Amy = Corey - 2. Since Corey is 11, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

From the third piece of information, we can write an equation for Jackson's age in terms of Amy's age: Jackson = Amy - 5. Since Amy is 9, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, the solution to the problem is that Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's denote Gerald's original time as G. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald. Since Lee runs it in 38 seconds, we can express Gerald's original time as G = 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means his new time is 90% of his original time. We can express this as 0.9G = new time.

We are given that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and we want to find Gerald's new time. We can set up the equation 0.9G = new time.

Since we know Gerald's original time is 40 seconds, we can substitute G = 40 into the equation: 0.9(40) = new time.

Now, we can solve for the new time: 0.9(40) = 36.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R. We are given the following information:

1. R = D + C - 12
2. C = 2D
3. D = 60

We can substitute the value of D into the second equation to find the value of C:
C = 2 * 60
C = 120

Now, we can substitute the values of D and C into the first equation to find the value of R:
R = 60 + 120 - 12
R = 168

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
Total = D + C + R
Total = 60 + 120 + 168
Total = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 must be girls.

Total students = 200
Boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout.

Girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

To do this, we multiply 9 hours by 2/3. Multiplying a number by a fraction is the same as multiplying the number by the numerator and then dividing by the denominator. So, 9 * 2 = 18, and then 18 / 3 = 6.

Now, we need to find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept. 
Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours, so the difference is 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish a ratio between the volume of the sauce and the volume of the tomatoes before cooking. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the ratio of the sauce volume to the original tomato volume is 1:2.

Given that the sauce made is 32 ounces, we can set up a proportion to find the original volume of the tomatoes: 1/2 = 32/x, where x is the original volume of the tomatoes.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 1 * x = 2 * 32, which simplifies to x = 64.

Now that we know the original volume of the tomatoes is 64 ounces, we can find the number of cans used by dividing the original volume by the volume of each can: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can find the total number of tomatoes by multiplying the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's dive into the problem at hand. We're given that some cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, and then 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. After that, 5 cars took an exit, leaving 25 cars that actually drove through the traffic jam.

We know that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Since we know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, we can represent the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

We're also given that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25. So, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she gives away.

First, let's find out how many potted plants Mary already has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home. To find the total number of plants, we multiply the number of plants per ledge by the total number of ledges: 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, Mary received 18 new potted plants from the nursery. To find the new total, we add the number of new plants to the initial number of plants: 80 + 18 = 98.

Now, we need to find out how many plants she will give away. She will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family. So, the number of plants she gives away is 40.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to determine the number of doorbell rings for each friend and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we multiply 20 by 1/4, which is 5, and then add it to 20. This gives us 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, we add 10 to 60 to find the number of doorbell rings for the third friend, which is 70.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

"To determine the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we need to add up the pages from all his textbooks. 

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) = 24 pages
24 pages + 7 pages (History) = 31 pages
31 pages + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many pages are left to read.

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

"To determine the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to establish the ratio of the city's distance to the rate at which the fog bank covers it.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

We can set up a proportion to find the time it takes to cover the entire city:

42 miles (city distance) / 3 miles (fog bank rate) = x minutes (time to cover the city) / 10 minutes (time to cover 3 miles)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

42 * 10 = 3x
420 = 3x
x = 420 / 3
x = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the inner volume of the boxes, we need to calculate the volume of the inner space of each box. 

The dimensions of the inner space of each box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the original dimensions).

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height. 

So, the volume of the inner space of one box is 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"Let's break down Frankie's TV-watching schedule into a system of equations to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday as x. 

We know that the total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up an equation based on the time spent watching 1-hour episodes and 30-minute episodes:

2 (1-hour episodes on Monday and Tuesday) + 1.5 (1-hour episode on Thursday) + 2 (1-hour episodes on Friday) + 0.5x (30-minute episodes on Wednesday) = 7

Simplifying the equation, we get:
2 + 1.5 + 2 + 0.5x = 7
5.5 + 0.5x = 7

Subtracting 5.5 from both sides of the equation:
0.5x = 1.5

Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.5:
x = 3

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards and then subtract the cashback rewards.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the cashback reward per gallon is $0.20. 

First, we multiply the cost of gas per gallon by the number of gallons to find the total cost of gas without rewards: 
$3.00 * 10 = $30.00

Next, we multiply the cashback reward per gallon by the number of gallons to find the total cashback rewards:
$0.20 * 10 = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each person had and then find the average.

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so we multiply the width by the length to find the total number of roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so we multiply the width by the length to find the total number of roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42.

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each person: 48 + 42 = 90.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups eaten by 2: 90 / 2 = 45.

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten is 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to establish the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that for every 10 feet rowed, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. 

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is rowing. It took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the rate, we can set up a proportion: 20 feet / 16 seconds = x feet / 1 second. Solving for x, we get x = 1.25 feet/second.

Now, we can use this rate to find the total distance rowed in 64 seconds: distance = rate * time = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

Since the boat takes on water at a rate of 2 liters for every 10 feet, we can set up another proportion: 2 liters / 10 feet = y liters / 80 feet. Solving for y, we get y = 0.25 liters/foot. 

To find the total amount of water taken on, we can multiply the total distance by the rate: 80 feet * 0.25 liters/foot = 20 liters.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo as D.

From the given information, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. This can be expressed as:
   1800 = 6B

2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This can be expressed as:
   B = 50D

Now, we can solve for B using the first equation:
   B = 1800 / 6
   B = 300

Now that we know B, we can solve for D using the second equation:
   300 = 50D
   D = 300 / 50
   D = 6

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is 6.

"To find the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from selling it.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 each = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 each = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 each = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 each = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Lylah's salary as 70% of Adrien's salary. Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, Lylah's salary four years ago was 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Next, we need to calculate the increase in Adrien's salary over the four-year period. His new salary is 40% higher than his old salary. To find the increase, we calculate 40% of $40000, which is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. Therefore, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Similarly, we need to calculate the increase in Lylah's salary over the four-year period. Her new salary is 40% higher than her old salary. To find the increase, we calculate 40% of $28000, which is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. Therefore, Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

The final answer is: $95200"

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour:
Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph

"To find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we need to determine how many letters were in that pile before Jennie started stamping.

Let's denote the initial number of letters in the already-stamped pile as x.

Jennie stamps one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps, which is 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters. This means the number of letters needing stamps after Jennie started is 60 - 20 = 40.

Since the number of letters in the already-stamped pile after Jennie started is 30, and she added 20 letters to it, the initial number of letters in the already-stamped pile is 30 - 20 = 10.

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"Let's dive into the problem at hand. Julia is preparing for a dinner party and needs to determine the number of spoons in the package she initially bought. We know that she had a total of 12 spoons after her husband gave her 5 more spoons and she used 3 spoons while making the stew.

To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. Initially, Julia had 'x' spoons. After her husband gave her 5 more spoons, she had 'x + 5' spoons. However, she used 3 spoons while making the stew, so she had 'x + 5 - 3' spoons left. We know that this number is equal to 12.

We can set up the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. w = 3p (A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs)
2. o = w - 5 (An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon)
3. 4w + 20p + 10o = Total (The total amount of money Dillon will spend)

We are given that the cost of each pepper is $15, so p = 15.

Substituting p = 15 into equation 1, we get:
w = 3(15)
w = 45

Substituting w = 45 into equation 2, we get:
o = 45 - 5
o = 40

Now that we have the values of w and o, we can substitute them into the third equation:
4(45) + 20(15) + 10(40) = Total
180 + 300 + 400 = Total
880 = Total

The final answer is: $880"
"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total revenue generated.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. We multiply the number of patients by the average time per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Now, we calculate the total cost for the doctors by multiplying the number of hours worked by the hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Next, we find the total revenue for the hospital by multiplying the number of patients by the hourly rate charged to the patients and then converting the time to hours.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour = 2000 * $200/hour = $400000

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $400000 - $30000
Profit = $370000

The final answer is: $370000"
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we calculate a third of the total number of elves, which is 60. To do this, we divide 60 by 3, resulting in 20. This is the number of elves that quit after children vomit on them.

2. Now, we subtract the number of elves that quit from the total number of elves: 60 - 20 = 40. This gives us the number of elves remaining after the first incident.

3. Next, we subtract the number of elves that quit after kids kick their shins from the remaining number of elves: 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30."
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June.

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = Expenditure in May - $60
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60 = $440

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

The final answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. Then, on Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. This means he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

Now, we know the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total. 

So, we subtract 4 miles (Monday) and 24 miles (Tuesday) from the total of 41 miles: 
41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find the total cost of car washes per year, we need to calculate the total cost of car washes per month and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15. 
So, the total cost per month is 4 * $15 = $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of video games Brian has after losing 5. We know Brian initially has 20 video games, so we subtract 5 from this number to find his remaining video games.

Brian's remaining video games = 20 - 5 = 15

Now, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. We are told that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find this number, we multiply Brian's remaining video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

Bobby's video games = (3 * 15) - 5

First, we multiply 3 by 15: 3 * 15 = 45

Then, we subtract 5 from this result: 45 - 5 = 40

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to calculate two thirds of the unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. 

First, we find the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this by dividing 27 by 3. 

27 / 3 = 9

Now, we need to find two thirds of 9. To do this, we multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3.

(9 * 2) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee to the total cost of the items. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20:
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
- Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total cost with the delivery fee:
- Total cost with delivery fee and tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 
Time taken to complete the first test = 75 / 5 = 15 hours. However, Mark only had 8 hours, so we need to find out how many questions he completed in 8 hours. 
Questions completed in 8 hours = 8 * 5 = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
Time taken to complete the second test = 100 / 5 = 20 hours. However, Mark only had 6 hours, so we need to find out how many questions he completed in 6 hours. 
Questions completed in 6 hours = 6 * 5 = 30 questions.

Total questions completed = 40 + 30 = 70

Total questions in both tests = 75 + 100 = 175

Questions left incomplete = 175 - 70 = 105

The final answer is: 105"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to first determine the relationship between the number of pink and blue gumballs. We are given that there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs.

Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as B. We are given that B = 12.

The number of pink gumballs can be expressed as 4B + 22, since it is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs.

Substituting the value of B, we get the number of pink gumballs as 4(12) + 22.

First, we multiply 4 and 12 to get 48. Then, we add 22 to get 70.

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write the equation W = 2B.

We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so we can write the equation B = 2Q.

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write the equation W + B + Q = 700.

Now we have a system of three equations:

1) W = 2B
2) B = 2Q
3) W + B + Q = 700

We can substitute equation (1) into equation (3) to get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

We can substitute equation (2) into the simplified equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find B by substituting Q into equation (2): B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find W by substituting B into equation (1): W = 2(200) = 400.

The final answer is: 400"

"To calculate the total cost, we need to separate the items into food and non-food categories.

Food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
First, we calculate the total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars
Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we calculate the tax amount: 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar
Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To calculate the total profit, we need to determine the total income and total expenses.

Kim has a total of 8 clients, with each client requiring 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to consider the number of pineapples per hectare and the frequency of harvests.

There are 100 pineapples per hectare, and John has 10 hectares. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is 100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

To find the total number of pineapples harvested in a year, we multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and add them together.

The first set has 500 pieces. 
The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

Now, we add the number of pieces in each set together: 
500 + 1500 = 2000
2000 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. This means 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that have left the hive so far. We have 30 bees that left initially, and 15 bees returned, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. This means 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that have left the hive so far. We have 30 bees that left initially and 60 bees that left in the last 6 hours, so the total number of bees that have left the hive is 30 + 60 = 90 bees. However, 15 bees had not returned yet, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 15 (from the initial 30 bees) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. Since 15 bees had not returned yet, 15 bees return.

The final answer is: 15"

"To find the number of friends James has on Facebook, we need to determine the number of friends Dorothy has first. Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has ""x"". Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of friends James has. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we multiply the number of friends Dorothy has by 4:
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To determine the winner of the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distances to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. Steve lives 3 miles away, which is 5280 feet, and Tim lives 2 miles away, which is 10560 feet.

Now, let's calculate the time taken by each of them to get home.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 5280 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 12 minutes

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 12 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 12
Difference in time = 28 minutes

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires.

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

"Let's work backwards to find the initial number of french fries in the pack.

We know that after all the animals and ants were done, 5 french fries were left. Before that, ants carried off 1 french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries left after the raccoon ate.

Since the raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, the raccoon ate 2/3 of the fries that were left after the pigeons ate. Let's denote the number of fries left after the pigeons ate as y. Then, the raccoon ate (2/3)y fries, and 6 = y - (2/3)y.

To solve for y, we can simplify the equation: 6 = (1/3)y. Multiply both sides by 3 to get y = 18.

Now, we know that 18 fries were left after the pigeons ate. Before that, 3 pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. This means that 18 + 9 = 27 fries were left after the seagull ate.

The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which was 14 fries. So, the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. This means that 27 + 7 = 34 fries were eaten in total by the seagull and Dave.

Since Dave ate 14 fries initially, the total number of fries eaten by the seagull and Dave is 14 + 7 = 21. This means that 34 - 21 = 13 fries were eaten by the pigeons.

Now, we know that 3 pigeons ate 13 fries in total. Since each pigeon ate 3 fries, we can divide 13 by 3 to find the number of pigeons: 13 / 3 = 4.33. However, since we can't have a fraction of a pigeon, this means that the problem statement is incorrect, and we should assume that the pigeons ate 12 fries (3 * 4 = 12).

Now, we know that 12 fries were eaten by the pigeons, and 27 fries were left after the seagull ate. This means that 27 + 12 = 39 fries were left after Dave ate.

The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which was 14 fries. So, the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. This means that 39 + 7 = 46 fries were eaten in total by the seagull and Dave.

Since Dave ate 14 fries initially, the total number of fries eaten by the seagull and Dave is 14 + 7 = 21. This means that 46 - 21 = 25 fries were eaten by the seagull.

Now, we know that the seagull ate 25 fries, and Dave ate 14 fries initially. This means that the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it is 25 + 14 = 39.

The final answer is: 39"
"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: Since each baguette is 2 feet long, we need to convert feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long. Now, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

"To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape per month and then multiply it by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1400}$"
"To determine the distance each person ran, we need to calculate the total distance covered by Blake and Kelly.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"

"To find the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we know the initial depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so we add 7 to 17 to find the depth on Tuesday.

17 + 7 = 24

Now, we need to find two thirds of the depth on Tuesday. To do this, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (2) and then divide by the denominator (3).

24 * 2 = 48
48 / 3 = 16

Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin

P = principal (initial price) = $20
r = annual interest rate (20% increase every 2 months, so we'll calculate the monthly rate) = 20%/2 = 10%/month = 0.10
n = number of times interest is compounded per year = 12 (since it's compounded every 2 months, we'll use 6 periods per year)
t = time in years = 36 months / 12 = 3 years

However, since the interest is compounded every 2 months, we'll use the formula:

A = P(1 + r)^t

Where:
A = final amount
P = principal (initial price) = $20
r = monthly interest rate = 10%/month = 0.10
t = time in months = 36

A = $20(1 + 0.10)^36
A â‰ˆ $20(3.207135)
A â‰ˆ $64.1427

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to calculate the price increase every 2 months and add it to the original price. 

Let's recalculate the price increase every 2 months:

After 2 months, the price will be:
Price = $20 + ($20 * 0.20)
= $20 + $4
= $24

After 4 months, the price will be:
Price = $24 + ($24 * 0.20)
= $24 + $4.80
= $28.80

After 6 months, the price will be:
Price = $28.80 + ($28.80 * 0.20)
= $28.80 + $5.76
= $34.56

After 8 months, the price will be:
Price = $34.56 + ($34.56 * 0.20)
= $34.56 + $6.912
= $41.472

After 10 months, the price will be:
Price = $41.472 + ($41.472 * 0.20)
= $41.472 + $8.2944
= $49.7664

After 12 months, the price will be:
Price = $49.7664 + ($49.7664 * 0.20)
= $49.7664 + $9.95328
= $59.71968

After 14 months, the price will be:
Price = $59.71968 + ($59.71968 * 0.20)
= $59.71968 + $11.943736
= $71.663416

After 16 months, the price will be:
Price = $71.663416 + ($71.663416 * 0.20)
= $71.663416 + $14.3326832
= $85.9960992

After 18 months, the price will be:
Price = $85.9960992 + ($85.9960992 * 0.20)
= $85.9960992 + $17.19921984
= $103.19531904

After 20 months, the price will be:
Price = $103.19531904 + ($103.19531904 * 0.20)
= $103.19531904 + $20.639063608
= $123.834382648

After 22 months, the price will be:
Price = $123.834382648 + ($123.834382648 * 0.20)
= $123.834382648 + $24.7668765296
= $148.6012591776

After 24 months, the price will be:
Price = $148.6012591776 + ($148.6012591776 * 0.20)
= $148.6012591776 + $29.72025183552
= $178.32151101312

After 26 months, the price will be:
Price = $178.32151101312 + ($178.32151101312 * 0.20)
= $178.32151101312 + $35.664302202624
= $214.985813215744

After 28 months, the price will be:
Price = $214.985813215744 + ($214.985813215744 * 0.20)
= $214.985813215744 + $42.9971624431488
= $257.9829756588928

After 30 months, the price will be:
Price = $257.9829756588928 + ($257.9829756588928 * 0.20)
= $257.9829756588928 + $51.59659513177856
= $309.5795707906712

After 32 months, the price will be:
Price = $309.5795707906712 + ($309.5795707906712 * 0.20)
= $309.5795707906712 + $61.91581415813424
= $371.49538494880544

After 34 months, the price will be:
Price = $371.49538494880544 + ($371.49538494880544 * 0.20)
= $371.49538494880544 + $74.299076989761088
= $445.794461938566528

After 36 months, the price will be:
Price = $445.794461938566528 + ($445.794461938566528 * 0.20)
= $445.794461938566528 + $89.1588923877133056

"To determine the difference in cost between doing taxes herself and hiring an accountant, we need to calculate the income Jackie will lose by doing the taxes herself and compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself:
Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant:
Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:
Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

The final answer is: $15"

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information. Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S.

We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write the second equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Now, we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

J = 2E + 2

We are also given that Ethel has $8. Substituting E = 8 into the equation, we get:

J = 2(8) + 2
J = 16 + 2
J = 18

Therefore, Jimmy has $18."
"To find the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking habits. He walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is a total of 5 days. 

The total miles walked from Monday to Friday is 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On the weekends, he walks 10 miles a day for 2 days. So, the total miles walked on Saturday and Sunday is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Let's denote the ages of Sally Two, Sally Four, Granny Red, and Sally Thirtytwo as S2, S4, GR, and S32, respectively.

We are given the following information:

1. S2 = S4 + 3
2. GR = 2 * S4
3. S4 = S32
4. S32 = 8

From equation 4, we know S32 = 8. Substituting this into equation 3, we get S4 = 8.

Now, substituting S4 = 8 into equation 2, we get GR = 2 * 8 = 16.

Substituting S4 = 8 into equation 1, we get S2 = 8 + 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together: S2 + S4 + GR + S32 = 11 + 8 + 16 + 8 = 43

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations involving profit, cost, and unit pricing.

Let's denote the number of gallons as G, the cost of lemons per gallon as L, and the cost of sugar per gallon as S. We know that the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5, and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2, so the cost of lemons per gallon is L = $3.

We are given the following information:

- The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5.
- The cost of sugar per gallon is $2, so the cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
- Each glass of lemonade is sold for $0.50 and they get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.
- They made a profit of $25.

We can set up the following equation based on the profit:
   Total revenue = Total cost + Profit
   10G = 5G + 2G + 25

Simplifying the equation:
   10G = 7G + 25
   3G = 25
   G = 25/3

Now that we have the number of gallons, we can find the cost of lemons:
   Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
   Total cost of lemons = 3 * (25/3)
   Total cost of lemons = 25

"To find the number of Chinese participants, we need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants.

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know the total number of Chinese participants is 160. Since the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations and 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write the equation: 5x = 200. 

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40. 
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote Mark's current age as M and Jean's current age as J. We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write the first equation as:

J = M + 2

We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30, two years ago Jan was 28. We can write the second equation as:

M - 2 = (1/2)(28) + 5

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we have Mark's age, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find Jean's age:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the total time for the well-rounded team and the less well-rounded team.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

However, I noticed that the total time for the less well-rounded team was miscalculated. Let's recalculate it: 60 + 57 = 117, 117 + 54 = 171, 171 + 51 = 222. The total time for the less well-rounded team is indeed 222 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 222 = -2 seconds. However, since time cannot be negative, this indicates that the less well-rounded team is actually faster."
"To determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of outcomes. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) and 6 total outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Since the two events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 25%"
"To find the total number of apples Jenna and her mother picked, we need to consider the number of apples each of them picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, and her mother picked 20 apples, we can find Jenna's share by dividing her mother's total by 2.

20 / 2 = 10

So, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three types of small rodents: rats, hamsters, and rabbits. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r', the number of hamsters as 'h', and the number of rabbits as 'b'. We know that the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 5h, the total number of straw pieces given to the rabbits is 20, and the total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 6r.

We are given that the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160. This gives us the equation 5h + 20 + 6r = 160.

We also know that the total number of hamsters is 10, so h = 10.

Substituting h = 10 into the equation 5h + 20 + 6r = 160, we get 5(10) + 20 + 6r = 160. Simplifying this equation, we get 50 + 20 + 6r = 160, which becomes 70 + 6r = 160.

Subtracting 70 from both sides of the equation, we get 6r = 90.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 6, we get r = 15.

However, we are asked to find the number of rats in each cage, not the total number of rats. Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is r/3.

Substituting r = 15 into the equation r/3, we get 15/3 = 5.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to find the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $100 * 0.02 = $2, since the principal remains the same.
The interest for the third month is $100 * 0.02 = $2, since the principal remains the same.

The total interest is $2 + $2 + $2 = $6.

The total amount Mandy should pay is $100 + $6 = $106.

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the tickets, food, and rides. 

The cost of the tickets is $20.25. 
The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, so it's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, we add the costs together: $20.25 + $15.75 = $36, then $36 + $66 = $102.

To find out how much each friend paid, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years, then subtract the trees that die.

First, let's find the net change in trees per year. Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Tom starts with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

Now, we subtract the trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, let's break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color.

Total number of crayons she can buy = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons she can buy = 10

Now, to find out how much change she will get, we need to subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has.

Total cost of crayons = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 * $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 
Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens.
Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"

"To find the total number of PokÃ©mon cards Elaine has now, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, Elaine initially had 20 PokÃ©mon cards. In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

Next, in the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Then, in the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100, and twice that is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as x. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B is also x.

We know that the total number of sentences Mark edits each week is 1000, so we can write the equation:

x + x = 1000

Combine like terms:

2x = 1000

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 500

This means Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

We are given that Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, the amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, the total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of the amounts from both publishers:

2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To calculate John's total annual income, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = 100
New weekly salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John works every week of the year, we'll multiply his new weekly salary by the number of weeks he works:
Total annual income from salary = New weekly salary * Number of weeks
= 2100 * 52
= 109200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total annual income:
Total annual income = Total annual income from salary + One-time reward
= 109200 + 5000
= 114200

The total amount John made that year is $114200."
"The art of multiplication. It's a beautiful thing. In this case, we have a straightforward problem. We're given that Josie's 10-acre farm produces 5 tons of grapes per acre per year. To find the total tons of grapes produced per year, we multiply the number of acres by the tons per acre:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Now, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, to find the total barrels of wine produced per year, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels per ton:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's consider the slices used for sandwiches. Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week, which has 7 days. He used 2 slices of cheese for each sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches can be calculated as follows:

7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices

Next, let's consider the slices used for omelets. Carl made omelets for 3 days, and he used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. The total slices used for omelets can be calculated as follows:

3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices

Now, let's consider the slices used for the macaroni and cheese dish. Carl used 8 slices of cheese for this dish.

To find the total number of slices used, we need to add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together:

14 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to her initial number of pens.

Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.
Janet bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

The total number of new pens she bought is 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Since Brinley needs a total score of 558 for the semester, we need to find the score she needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks. We know Michael rode his bike 5 times a week, and each time he rode 25 kilometers. So, we multiply the number of kilometers per ride by the number of rides per week and then by the number of weeks:

25 kilometers/ride * 5 rides/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 kilometers

Next, let's calculate the total kilometers for the next three weeks. Now, Michael rides his bike 2 times a week, and each time he rides 60 kilometers. We multiply the number of kilometers per ride by the number of rides per week and then by the number of weeks:

60 kilometers/ride * 2 rides/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 kilometers

Now, we add the total kilometers for both periods to find the overall total:

500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

First, we find the weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, and each weighs 40g. So, the weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Next, we find the weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. Therefore, the weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: 2600"
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

First, let's find the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Since she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, and she bought 4 cakes on Monday, she bought 3 * 4 = 12 cakes on Tuesday.

Next, let's find the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday. Since she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, and she bought 12 cakes on Tuesday, she bought 5 * 12 = 60 cakes on Wednesday.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"To find the cost of each cup, we need to first determine the total cost of twenty dozen cups. Let's denote the cost of each cup as 'x'. Since twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, we can set up the equation:

20 * 12 * x = 36,000 - 1,200

Simplifying the equation, we get:

240x = 34,800

Now, we can solve for 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by 240:

x = 34,800 / 240
x = 145

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy: a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each. 

The total cost of the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40. Adding this to the cost of the jacket, we get $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W.

We know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs while each white chicken produces 5 eggs. This gives us the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

We also know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

W = R + 2

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for R:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

"To find the total time Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now that we have the perimeter, we can find the time Gary spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, so:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to calculate the total number of customers on the first two days and then subtract that from the total by the third day.

The total number of customers on the first day is 100. On the second day, there were 50 more customers than the first day, so the total for the second day is 100 + 50 = 150.

Now, let's add the total number of customers on the first two days: 100 + 150 = 250.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total by the third day: 500 - 250 = 250.

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool as S(t) and the amount of water in the big pool as B(t), where t is time in minutes. We know that both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons/minute, so we can write the differential equations:

dS/dt = -4
dB/dt = -4

We are given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This can be expressed as:

S(t - 4) = B(t - 4)/2

We are also given that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This can be expressed as:

S(0) = B(0)/4

Since the differential equations are linear and constant, we can solve them directly. The general solution for both S(t) and B(t) is:

S(t) = S(0) - 4t
B(t) = B(0) - 4t

We can use the initial condition S(0) = B(0)/4 to express B(0) in terms of S(0):

B(0) = 4S(0)

Substituting this into the equation for B(t), we get:

B(t) = 4S(0) - 4t

Now we can use the condition S(t - 4) = B(t - 4)/2 to find S(0):

S(0) - 4(4) = (4S(0) - 4(4))/2

Simplifying the equation:

S(0) - 16 = 2S(0) - 8

Subtracting S(0) from both sides:

-16 = S(0) - 8

Adding 8 to both sides:

-8 = S(0)

Now that we have S(0), we can find the amount of water in the small pool now, which is S(0) - 4:

S(0) - 4 = -8 - 4
= -12

However, this is not possible since the amount of water cannot be negative. This means that the initial condition S(t - 4) = B(t - 4)/2 is not consistent with the given information.

However, we can try another approach. Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is 2x gallons.

The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 gallons (since 4 gallons leaked out). The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 4 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and we need to find the average age of Harriet, Zack, and Adrian in three years.

We know that Harriet is half the age of Zack, so we can express Zack's age as 2x, where x is Harriet's age. Since Harriet is 21, we can write Zack's age as 2 * 21 = 42.

We are also given that Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so we can express Adrian's age as 3x, where x is Harriet's age. Since Harriet is 21, we can write Adrian's age as 3 * 21 = 63.

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. We can add 3 to each of their current ages to get their ages in three years:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by the other three students. 

Let's start by finding out how many points Yuri scored. Since Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi, we can represent this as an equation: Yuri's points = (Naomi's points / 2) + 10. Given that Naomi scored 68 points, we can substitute this value into the equation: Yuri's points = (68 / 2) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Next, we need to find out how many points Brianna scored. Since Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, we can represent this as an equation: Brianna's points = Naomi's points + 17. Given that Naomi scored 68 points, we can substitute this value into the equation: Brianna's points = 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now that we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna, we can find the total points scored by these three students: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the total points scored by the other three students from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type.

Initial water type cards = 40
Initial grass type cards = 20
Initial total cards = 40 + 20 + 30 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32
- Total cards = 90 - 8 = 82

After buying 14 grass type cards:
- Grass type cards = 20 + 14 = 34
- Total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

Now, we can calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100

The total cost of the extra items is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of work.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the time it will take to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate.

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is: 1"

1. Calculate the number of melons ready for harvest after two months: 
   30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 melons.

2. Calculate the number of melons remaining after two months: 
   120 - 36 = 84 melons.

3. Calculate the number of melons ready for harvest after two weeks: 
   3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 melons.

4. Calculate the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks: 
   84 - 63 = 21 melons.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fee.

First, we calculate the total cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars: 10% of $240,000 is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Then, we calculate the registration fee: 12 cars * $1000 per car = $12,000.

Finally, we add these costs together: $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. Robert collects 20 shells, and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert. 

So, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.

25 * 2 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to determine the number of bugs and add it to the number of ants. 

Since there were half as many bugs as ants, and there were 50 ants, we can find the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects.

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

"To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we need to calculate how many penguins jumped in the ocean and went inside the cave. 

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. 
So, 12 penguins jumped in the ocean and 12 penguins went inside the cave.

In total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the sunbathing area.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 
36 - 24 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first calculate the total number of tomatoes he and his girlfriend eat per week. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats half that amount, which is 3 tomatoes per day. 

To find the total number of tomatoes they eat per week, we multiply the number of tomatoes each of them eats per day by 7: 
6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week (Steve)
3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend)

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find the number of vines needed: 
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we must first calculate the total number of slices required for his friends. 

Total number of friends: 20
Number of slices per friend: 4
Total number of slices required: 20 * 4 = 80

Since pizzas are sold in slices of 8, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 

Number of slices per pizza: 8
Number of pizzas required: 80 / 8 = 10

However, since we cannot order a fraction of a pizza, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure each friend gets their desired number of slices. In this case, we need to round up 10 to 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of pens Ram gets, we need to calculate the number of new pens he can make from the ink of the 25 pens he buys.

Since he can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, we divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many new pens he can make. 25 pens divided by 5 is 5.

Now, we have 5 empty pens left. We can use the ink from these 5 pens to make 5 new pens.

To find the total number of pens, we add the initial 25 pens to the 5 new pens from the first 25 pens and the 5 new pens from the 5 empty pens. 

25 + 5 + 5 = 35

"Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as J', and Mary's age as M. We are given the following system of linear equations:

1. M = J - 2
2. J' = J + 5
3. J = 20

We can substitute equation (3) into equation (2) to find J':
J' = 20 + 5
J' = 25

Now, we can substitute J' into equation (1) to find M:
M = 25 - 2
M = 23

Now that we have the values of J, J', and M, we can find the sum of their ages:
Sum = J + J' + M
Sum = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum = 68

First, 30% of the students went out through exit A:
30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.
Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.
Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280

The rest of the students went out through exit C:
280 students went out through exit C.

"Let's analyze the given information:

John has 54 candies, and he has twice as many candies as Robert. This can be represented as:

J = 2R

where J is the number of candies John has, and R is the number of candies Robert has.

We are given that John has 54 candies, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

54 = 2R

To find the number of candies Robert has, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

R = 54 / 2
R = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find the number of candies James has. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:

J = R + 6
J = 27 + 6
J = 33

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

Difference = J - R
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

"To determine the total time Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"

First, let's calculate the total minutes used for daily calls: 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.

Next, we add the extra minutes: 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan: 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, after Billy took his share, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Now, let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two aquariums with an equal number of fish, denoted as x. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2 to isolate x:

7 = x

This means there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost, we first need to calculate the daily cost, then multiply it by the number of days per week, and finally multiply that by the number of weeks.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works 6 hours a day. 
Daily cost = $250 * 6 = $1500

Since the makeup artist needs to be done 4 times a week, we multiply the daily cost by 4.
Weekly cost = $1500 * 4 = $6000

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so we multiply the weekly cost by 5.
Total cost before discount = $6000 * 5 = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount.
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000
Total amount Jean paid = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"

"To find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister, we need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate and then multiply it by the calories per cookie.

First, let's find the total number of cookies Sue ate. On Monday, she ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, and her sister ate 5 cookies. So, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, and her sister ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's find the total number of cookies her sister ate. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so the total number of cookies her sister ate is 5 + 13 = 18.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can find the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister by multiplying the total number of cookies they ate by 200.

Total calories consumed by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Total calories consumed by her sister = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

Now, let's find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister: 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students in each class. This means the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls: 30 - 27 = 3.

Now, we know that the total number of students in the school is 60, and the total number of girls is 30. Therefore, the total number of boys in the school is 60 - 30 = 30.

Since the third class has 20 students, and we want to find the number of boys in the third class, we can set up a proportion to find the number of boys in the third class.

Let x be the number of boys in the third class. We know that the total number of boys in the school is 30, and the total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33. Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 33 = -3. However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of students.

However, if we re-evaluate the problem, we can find the number of boys in the third class by setting up a proportion. Let x be the number of boys in the third class. We know that the total number of boys in the school is 30, and the total number of boys in the first two classes is 33. We can set up the proportion:

(33 / 60) = (x / 20)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

33 * 20 = 60x
660 = 60x
x = 660 / 60
x = 11

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Rick killed 15 cougars the previous night. Today, he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is the sum of the wolves killed last night and the wolves killed today, which is 10 + 36 = 46.

The total number of cougars killed is the sum of the cougars killed last night and the cougars killed today, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the total number of wolves and the total number of cougars: 46 + 27 = 73.

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

Number of cows added to each stall = Total cows bought / Number of stalls
= 40 / 10
= 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 * 8

"Let's denote the number of apples that Jamal has as 'J' and the number of bananas that Jamal has as 'B'. 

From the given information, we can form the following system of equations:

1. J + 8 = 52 (since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal)
2. B = 2J (since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal)
3. B = J + 4 (since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples)

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From equation 2, we have B = 2J. Substituting this into equation 3, we get 2J = J + 4. Subtracting J from both sides, we get J = 4.

Now that we have the value of J, we can find the value of B by substituting J into equation 2: B = 2(4) = 8.

However, we know that B = J + 4, so we can verify that B = 4 + 4 = 8, which matches our previous result.

Now that we have the values of J and B, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have: 2J + 2B = 2(4) + 2(8) = 8 + 16 = 24 (Andrea's fruits) + 4 + 8 = 12 (Jamal's fruits) = 36.

However, this is incorrect. We need to add the total number of fruits that both Andrea and Jamal have. Since Andrea has 52 apples and Jamal has 44 apples, the total number of apples is 52 + 44 = 96. Since Andrea has 8 bananas and Jamal has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 8 + 4 = 12. The total number of fruits is 96 + 12 = 108.

"To find the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the total number of cookies Carla is making and then determine the corresponding amount of flour.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5. 

Since 5.5 dozens is the same as 5 dozen and 6 cookies, we need to calculate the flour needed for 6 cookies. 6 cookies is half of a dozen, so we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we need to add the flour needed for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. 5 dozen cookies need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

So, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to find the total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

We then subtract the total fees from the selling price to find the net selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the process into its individual steps.

First, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. Since it takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes to determine the additional time required to reach 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil to 400 degrees. Therefore, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time by adding the time it takes to heat up to 300 degrees, the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

Total time = 20 (to heat up to 300 degrees) + 28 (to heat up to 400 degrees) + 23 (to cook) = 71 minutes.

The final answer is: 71"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the total spent on newspaper ads and television ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to determine the total number of golf balls first. Since half of the balls the juggler can juggle are golf balls, we divide the total number of balls by 2.

Total balls = 16
Golf balls = Total balls / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8

Now, we need to find the number of blue golf balls, which is half of the golf balls.

Blue golf balls = Golf balls / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 
300 + 312 = 612
612 + 150 = 762

The final answer is: 762"
"To find the total number of windows, we first need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms. There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, so the total number of bedrooms is 2 * 3 = 6. 
Each bedroom has 2 windows, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Next, we need to find the total number of additional windows in the houses. There are 4 additional windows in each house, and since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the overall total. This is 12 + 8 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to add the cost of the cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

The cost of the cocoa is $4.20, the laundry is $9.45, and the pasta is $1.35. 

First, we add the cost of the cocoa and the laundry: $4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65
Then, we add the cost of the pasta to the previous total: $13.65 + $1.35 = $14.00

The mother pays $20, so to find the change, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount she paid.

Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to determine the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"
"To find the total amount of money spent on seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tomato seeds: 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the celery seeds: 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

Now, we add the two costs together: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The total amount of money spent on seeds is $3200."
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information given.

The solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of these lines are Sean's, we need to divide 108 by 3 to find the number of lines from the first scene that Sean has to memorize: 108 / 3 = 36.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, we need to multiply 60 by 4 and then divide by 5 to find the number of lines from the second scene that Sean has to memorize: (4/5) * 60 = 48.

Now, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene to find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To calculate the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes
Next, let's find the time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes together: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to consider their current ages and add 10 to each of them. 

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as m. We know that M + m = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: (M + m) + 10 + 10. Since M + m = 20, we can substitute this value into the expression: 20 + 10 + 10.

Now, let's perform the addition: 20 + 10 = 30, and 30 + 10 = 40.

The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years is 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can rewrite the second equation to make it easier to solve:
R + 9 = 3S + 27

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To determine the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for, we first calculate the total number of team members, coaches, and guests. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 
The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of sterling silver beads as 'b'. Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 of them, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, so the total length of the spaces is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The length of each space is the total length of the spaces divided by the number of spaces, which is 17 / 7 = 2.4286 (approximately) inches. However, we know that each space is filled with 1/4 inch beads, so we can set up the equation:

7 * (1/4) + 8 * 1 = 25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7/4 + 8 = 25

Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

7 + 32 = 100

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

32 = 93

However, this is not correct. Let's re-evaluate the equation. The correct equation should be:

However, this is also not correct. Let's re-evaluate the equation again. The correct equation should be:

7 * (1/4) + 8 * 1 = 25

Since we know that 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75, we can rewrite the equation as:

1.75 + 8 = 25

Subtracting 1.75 from both sides:

8 = 23.25

However, this is also not correct. Let's re-evaluate the equation again. The correct equation should be:

7 * (1/4) + 8 * 1 = 25

Since we know that 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75, we can rewrite the equation as:

1.75 + 8 = 25

Subtracting 1.75 from both sides:

8 = 23.25

However, this is also not correct. Let's re-evaluate the equation again. The correct equation should be:

"To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we need to add the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

Alani doubled her stories from 20 to 20 * 2 = 40.
Braylen doubled his stories from 40 to 40 * 2 = 80.
Margot doubled her stories from 60 to 60 * 2 = 120.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = 120 + 240 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the brother's current age, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2, as he is twice her age. Ann is 9 years old, so her brother's age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

In 3 years, her brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine how many cents Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop, we need to calculate the total value of her quarters and dimes.

Kelly has 5 quarters, each worth 25 cents. The total value of her quarters is 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, each worth 10 cents. The total value of her dimes is 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

The total amount Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount she has.

145 - 55 = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to determine the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so we multiply the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone:

80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks, which is 2000 pounds per truck:

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

Therefore, the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, and the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, the car in the slow lane's speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour, we can calculate its time as follows:
time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has 22 medals, and his friend Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, which means Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This can be represented as an equation: 10x = 39, where x is the total number of medals given out.

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

However, since the number of medals cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a medal."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet: 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.

Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are given to the adults. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults, so we multiply the number of adults by the number of chocolate bars each adult gets: 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars.

Finally, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars among the children. There are 8 children, so we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a 3-hour period. However, she takes a half-hour break in between. To find the total working hours, we subtract the break time from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first.

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 21 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges the sons washed and then subtract that from the total number of oranges Will bought.

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 
He washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 
15 (total oranges) - 12 (oranges washed) = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of activities for each day and add them together.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Total for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total count of activities in two days: 170 + 200 = 370

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

"To find the difference between Sam's target and the actual number of crates sold, we need to calculate the total number of crates sold and then subtract that from the target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18
Total crates sold = 65

Now, let's calculate the difference between the target and the total crates sold.

Target = 120 crates
Difference = Target - Total crates sold
Difference = 120 - 65
Difference = 55

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the total amount bid. The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, there are a total of 4 people who bid once, and then Carmen bids one more time, making a total of 5 bids.

However, we need to consider the total number of bids made by Carmen. Since she bids after each of the 3 other people, and there are 3 other people, she bids 4 times. So, the total number of bids is 3 (from the other people) + 4 (from Carmen) = 7 bids.

The total amount bid is the sum of an arithmetic series with the first term a = 200, the common difference d = 50, and the number of terms n = 7.

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d)

Plugging in the values, we get:
S = (7/2) * (2*200 + (7-1)*50)
S = 3.5 * (400 + 6*50)
S = 3.5 * (400 + 300)
S = 3.5 * 700
S = 2450

The final answer is: $2450"
"To calculate John's annual driving expenses, we need to consider the total miles driven, the driving cost, and the bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven. Since John commutes to work and back each day, the daily distance is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles. With 5 days of work per week, the weekly distance is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. For 50 weeks in a year, the total miles driven is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Next, we calculate the driving cost. John is charged $2 per mile, so the total driving cost is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

In addition to the driving cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. With 12 months in a year, the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Now, we can calculate the total annual cost by adding the driving cost and the bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find the total minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, let's analyze the pattern of page arrangement.

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper. 

Considering the arrangement of pages, we can see that each pair of pages (one on the left side and one on the right side) corresponds to a single piece of paper. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we can pair the pages as follows:

- Page 1 (left back) and page 32 (right back)
- Page 2 (left front) and page 31 (right front)
- Page 3 (left back) and page 30 (right back)
- Page 4 (left front) and page 29 (right front)
- ...
- Page 16 (left back) and page 17 (right back)

Since there are 16 pairs of pages, we need 16 pieces of paper to accommodate all the pages.

However, we also need to consider the middle page, which is page 16. Since it's on the left back, it's paired with page 17 on the right back. This means we actually need 16 + 1 = 17 pieces of paper.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks. To find half of $50, we multiply $50 by 0.5 (since half is the same as 50% or 0.5). 

$50 * 0.5 = $25

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's analyze the given information:

Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at $20, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45.

Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as 'x'. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x.

We know that the total number of books sold in three years is the sum of the books sold in each year, which is equal to the total number of books minus the unsold books: 250 - 50 = 200.

The equation representing the total number of books sold is: x + 2x + x = 200

Combine like terms: 4x = 200

Divide both sides by 4: x = 50

Now that we know the number of books sold in the current year (x = 50), we can find the number of books sold in the second year. Since the number of books sold in the second year is the difference between the total number of books and the sum of the books sold in the first and current years, we have: 200 - 2x - x = 200 - 3x

Substitute x = 50: 200 - 3(50) = 200 - 150 = 50

However, this is the number of books sold in the second year, not the total amount of money earned. To find the total amount of money earned in the second year, we multiply the number of books sold in the second year by the price per book: 50 * 20 = 1000

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the total amount of money earned in the second year, which is actually 65 books. So, the correct answer is: 65 * 20 = 1300.

The final answer is: $1300"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to determine his weekly earnings and then multiply that by the number of weeks in April.

First, let's calculate his weekly earnings from his hourly wage: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Next, we add his weekly bonus to his hourly earnings: 
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Now, we multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in April: 
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find the number of people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of people he arm wrestled, which is 20.

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we determine the number of loaves sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the total loaves are sold in the morning. The total number of loaves produced is 60. Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. This is done by subtracting the morning sales from the total number of loaves: 60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon. Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is calculated as 20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of ratios and proportions. 

Let's break it down: Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. This means that Joey loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week).

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can set up a proportion to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

Let's say it takes Sandy x weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Since Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight in the same amount of time as Joey, we can set up the proportion:

2 pounds per week (Joey's rate) = 1/4 * 2 pounds per week (Sandy's rate)

To find x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

2 pounds per week * 4 = 1 * 2 pounds per week * x

8 pounds per week = 2 pounds per week * x

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 pounds per week:

8 pounds per week / 2 pounds per week = x

x = 4

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of new limbs, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5, which is 15. This is because the person grows an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days, so we need to find the smallest time interval at which both events occur.

Since the LCM is 15, in 15 days, the person will grow an extra arm and an extra leg. To find the total number of new limbs, we need to divide 15 by 3 and 5 to find the number of times each type of limb is grown.

Extra arms: 15 / 3 = 5
Extra legs: 15 / 5 = 3

However, since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, and an extra leg every 5 days, we need to consider the intervals at which both events occur. In this case, the LCM of 3 and 5 is 15, so we can simply add the number of extra arms and legs grown in 15 days.

Total new limbs = 5 extra arms + 3 extra legs = 8

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for his expenses and savings.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600.

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150.

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times this amount is $500. Therefore, the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of these items: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

To find out how much Theo has left, we subtract the total cost from his initial budget: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost) = $4050.

However, Theo wants to save $2000 for this trip. To find out how much he has left for gifts, we subtract the amount he wants to save from his remaining budget: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

Since he wants to save $2000, he has $2050 - $2000 = $50 left over, which he can spend on gifts.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs consumed in a day first.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they eat in a day is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.

The rest of the family members are 5 - 3 = 2. They eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they eat in a day is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week (7 days) is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

1. Trent is 5 years older than Jane: T = J + 5
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn: J = Q - 3
3. Quinn is 30 years old: Q = 30

We can substitute the value of Q into the second equation to find Jane's age: J = 30 - 3 = 27

Now that we have Jane's age, we can substitute it into the first equation to find Trent's age: T = 27 + 5 = 32

"Let's analyze the given information:

Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, which is 3000 * 20 = 60000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, we can set up the equation: 60000 = (1/2) * P, where P is the current population of Chile.

To find the current population, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2: P = 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D.

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

We are given that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 30

"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

Then, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. 
24 - 8 = 16 people

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
So, 2 people had previous commitments and couldn't come.

Now, subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited.
16 - 2 = 14 people

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find 2/5 of 20, we multiply 20 by 2 and then divide by 5: (20 * 2) / 5 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is a rectangular prism, so we use the formula: length x width x height.

Given dimensions:
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.
Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

Next, we find the number of nongendered children, which is 1/10 as many as the number of boys. This is calculated as 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, let's start by finding the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and the total number of people initially was 40. 

1/4 of 40 is 10, so 10 people left the party. Since 22 men stayed, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3. This means that 7 women left, as 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men.

Now, let's find the number of women who stayed. Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, we can find the magazine's cost by dividing the book's cost by 2.

The cost of the magazine is $4 Ã· 2 = $2.

Now, we need to find the cost of the pen. We know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. To find the pen's cost, we subtract $1 from the magazine's cost.

The cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's analyze the weakening caused by the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. We want to find the weakening caused by cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. 

Since the coffee is cooled from an initial temperature of 100 degrees to a final temperature of 35 degrees, the temperature difference is 65 degrees. The rate of weakening per degree is 12 milliliters / 13 degrees = 12/13 milliliters per degree. 

Now, we can calculate the weakening caused by the temperature change: 65 degrees * (12/13 milliliters/degree) = 60 milliliters.

Next, we need to consider the weakening caused by adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since the cream is added to the already weakened coffee, we simply add this value to the previous weakening: 60 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the problem into a system of equations. We know that 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, and 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records. Let's denote the number of old records each person brings in as 'x'. Since there are 5 people, the total number of old records is 5x.

We can set up the equation based on the number of new records: 2 * 5x = 7 * 1, since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record. However, this equation is not correct as it doesn't account for the fact that 5 people are trading records. A more accurate equation would be 5x / 2 = 7, since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record.

Now, let's solve the equation 5x / 2 = 7 for x.

5x / 2 = 7
5x = 7 * 2
5x = 14
x = 14 / 5
x = 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records. But in this case, we are looking for the total number of old records, so we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people.

Total number of old records = Number of old records per person * Number of people
Total number of old records = 2.8 * 5
Total number of old records = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. We know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. To find the number of junior programmers, we multiply 2/5 by 100.

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100
= 2 * 20
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is the remaining employees after subtracting the number of junior programmers.

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers. We know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Next, we need to find the salary of senior programmers. We know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.

Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers.

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Finally, we can find the total amount paid to all programmers by adding the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers.

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"To find the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, let's denote this number as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes 14 out to his friends, reducing his total to 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Adding these to his existing 8 lollipops, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, Oscar eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, resulting in 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we first need to determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to charge 40%, we multiply 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more and then subtract the 3 lollipops she gives to Ella.

First, we add 7 (Erin's initial lollipops) and 10 (the lollipops her mother gives her): 7 + 10 = 17.

Next, we subtract 3 (the lollipops Erin gives to Ella) from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip. The customer spent $80, and for every $20 they spend, they earn $1 off their next purchase. So, the rewards earned are $80 / $20 = $4.

On the current shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, which is $4 off the price. The remaining amount after using the rewards is $43 - $4 = $39.

Next, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off the price.

Now, we subtract the total discount from the remaining amount after using the rewards. The total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

Finally, we subtract the total discount from the remaining amount after using the rewards to find the amount the customer paid: $39 - $12 = $27.

The final answer is: $27"
"To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we need to calculate the net income for each job, taking into account both property tax and income tax.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. Since there's no property tax mentioned, we'll proceed with the income tax calculation. The income tax is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. Therefore, the net income for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The income tax is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. Consequently, the net income for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, let's compare the net incomes of the two jobs. To find the difference, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220.

First, we convert 40% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40 / 100 = 0.4

Then, we multiply 0.4 by 220: 0.4 * 220 = 88

Now, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find half of 88, we divide by 2: 88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment.

For Furniture United's offer:

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

First, we calculate the price increase in the first year: 50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
The price of each share after the first year is the initial price plus the increase: $8 + $4 = $12

Next, we calculate the price decrease in the second year: 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
The price of each share after the second year is the price after the first year minus the decrease: $12 - $3 = $9

Now, we multiply the price of each share after the second year by the total number of shares to find the total value: 8 * $9 = $72

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to first determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. This can be represented by the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x: 
70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem into a system of equations. We have two variables: the number of cows (C) and the number of chickens (H). We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation H + C = 60.

We also know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write the equation H = 2C.

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) H + C = 60
2) H = 2C

We can solve this system of equations by substituting the second equation into the first equation. This gives us:

2C + C = 60

Combine like terms:

3C = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

C = 20

Now that we know the value of C, we can find the value of H by substituting C into one of the original equations. We'll use the second equation:

H = 2C
H = 2(20)
H = 40

Now that we know the number of cows and chickens, we can find the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

"To determine the number of balls Josh starts juggling with on stage, we need to calculate the total number of balls he has after 4 weeks of practice and then subtract the number of balls he loses.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term (a) is 3, the common difference (d) is 1, and the number of terms (n) is 4. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d).

Plugging in the values, we get S = 4/2 * (2*3 + (4-1)*1) = 2 * (6 + 3) = 2 * 9 = 18.

So, Josh has 18 balls after 4 weeks of practice. However, he loses 3 balls, but 2 are caught, so he loses 1 ball. 

Therefore, Josh starts juggling with 18 - 1 = 17 balls.

However, this is incorrect, as Josh can't juggle 17 balls. The question states that Josh starts juggling with some balls after losing one. We need to subtract the balls he was juggling before losing one. Josh was juggling 7 balls before losing one. 

So, Josh starts juggling with 7 balls.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird as B, T, S, and R, respectively.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. B = 50 (since the blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog)
2. T = 50 (since the green toad weighs the same as the pink frog)
3. S = B + 10 (since the yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog)
4. R = B - 20 (since the red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog)

We can substitute the value of B from equation 1 into equations 3 and 4:

3. S = 50 + 10 = 60
4. R = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we can find the total weight of the animals and the container by adding their individual weights:

Total weight = B + T + S + R + container weight
= 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
= 210 + 50 (since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds and we are including it in the total weight)
= 260

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies used by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so we multiply 4 by 5 to find out how many cookies he eats in a week. 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so we multiply 1 by 7 to find out how many cookies he eats in a week. 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

Now, we add the number of cookies eaten by her son and husband. 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

The total number of cookies in a bag is 36. To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the number of cookies used by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in a bag. 36 - 27 = 9

Jenny eats 9 cookies."

"To find the time John spent sightseeing, we need to calculate the total time he spent on all activities and then find 40% of that total.

First, let's find the time spent watching shows. Since he watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Next, we know that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. Let's use this information to find the total time. We can set up the equation: 30% of total time = 6 hours. To find the total time, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 30 / 100 = 0.30. Now we can solve for the total time: 0.30 * total time = 6. To isolate the total time, we'll divide both sides by 0.30: total time = 6 / 0.30 = 20 hours.

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. We'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40 / 100 = 0.40. Now we can find the time spent sightseeing: 0.40 * 20 = 8 hours.

$5/hour * 15 hours = $75

Total earnings from both jobs: $200 + $75 = $275

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. To find out how much more she needs, we subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone:
$400 - $275 = $125

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first determine the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet. The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Now, we add the heights of the two shorter trees to find their combined height: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. To find this, we multiply the combined height by 2: 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and then subtract that from the initial amount he received plus the extra $10.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 = $12
Then, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 = $5
Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears: $12 + $5 = $17
Dean initially received $28 and got an extra $10, so he now has $28 + $10 = $38
Finally, let's subtract the amount Dean spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. 

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply it by the number of days she saves.

First, let's find out how much she spends on lollipops each day. Since each lollipop costs $0.25, 4 lollipops will cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day.
Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days.
Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to work backwards from the information given.

First, we know that Billy spent $2 on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can find the total number of gumballs he bought by dividing the total cost by the cost per gumball:

40 gumballs = 2 / 0.05

This confirms that he bought 40 gumballs, which is consistent with the information given.

Next, we know that Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs. This means that the amount he spent on gumballs is half of the change he had after buying the candy. Let's call the amount of money he had after buying the candy 'x'. Then, the change he had is x, and half of the change is x/2.

We know that x/2 = 2, so x = 4. This means that Billy had $4 after buying the candy.

Since Billy started with $10 and spent an unknown amount on candy, the amount he spent on candy is 10 - 4 = 6.

The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy he bought is the total cost divided by the cost per pound:

Number of pounds = 6 / 1.5

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the age of Carver's son, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the son's age as 'x'. According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be expressed as:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

Therefore, the age of Carver's son is 25 years.

"To find the total distance traveled in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the second city, the second city to the third city, and the third city to the first city. 

Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is:
Total distance in one trip: 300 miles
Total trips in a day: 3
Total distance in a day: 300 * 3 = 900 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we need to divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day.
Total distance between services: 18,000 miles
Total distance in a day: 900 miles
Number of days between services: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2. 
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 
Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To calculate the total time taken for John's trip, we need to consider the distance and speed for both legs of the trip.

The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles.

The time taken to drive to his friend's house is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed: 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

For the return trip, the distance is 240 miles, and the speed is 80 mph. The time taken to drive back home is 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

The total time taken for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house and the time taken to drive back home: 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to calculate the total number of students present and then determine the number of boys among them.

First, let's find the total number of students present. We know that 9 students were absent in total. 

Total number of fourth-graders = 96
Total number of students absent = 9
Number of students present = Total number of fourth-graders - Total number of students absent
= 96 - 9
= 87

Now, we need to find the number of girls present. We know that 43 girls were in the school initially and 5 were absent.

Number of girls present = Total number of girls - Number of absent girls
= 43 - 5
= 38

Now, we can find the number of boys present by subtracting the number of girls present from the total number of students present.

Number of boys present = Number of students present - Number of girls present
= 87 - 38

The points scored in the first test are 15, and the points scored in the second test are 18. To find the total points scored so far, we add these two values together.

Points scored so far = 15 + 18 = 33

Now, we subtract the points scored so far from the total required points to find the minimum points needed on the third test.

Points needed on the third test = Total required points - Points scored so far
= 42 - 33

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V.

We are given the following information:

1. M = 3 (customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks)
2. S = 4M - 5 (customers kicked out for shoplifting)
3. V = 3S (customers kicked out for physical violence)
4. M + S + V + O = 50 (total number of customers kicked out)

We can substitute the expressions for S and V into the fourth equation:

M + (4M - 5) + 3(4M - 5) + O = 50

Combine like terms:

M + 4M - 5 + 12M - 15 + O = 50

Combine like terms:

17M - 20 + O = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

17M + O = 70

Now, we can substitute the value of M into this equation. We know that M = 3:

17(3) + O = 70

Multiply 17 and 3:

51 + O = 70

Subtract 51 from both sides:

O = 19

"Let's analyze the given information: Erin now has 14 points, and she has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. 

To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first determine the total points Erin has now. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can express this as an equation: Erin's points = 3 * Sara's points. Given Sara's points are 8, Erin's points = 3 * 8 = 24.

However, we are given that Erin's current points are 14. To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to find the difference between Erin's total points and her current points. 

Let's denote Erin's points before as 'x'. We can set up the equation: x + 14 = 24, since Erin's total points (24) minus her current points (14) equals the points she had before.

To solve for 'x', we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation: x = 24 - 14. 

x = 10

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to consider the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the picture frames. The etching costs 20% of the cost of each frame, which is $20. To find 20% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.20, which equals $4. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching to get the total cost of the picture frames and etching: $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Lastly, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, and they will receive cords that cost $12 each. Since there are 44 seniors, 1/4 of 44 is 11. So, 11 seniors will receive cords, and the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

To find the total cost of all the gifts, we add the cost of the picture frames and etching, the cost of the pins, and the cost of the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold on Friday is 14 * 2 = 28.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 * 2 = 56.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 56 / 2 = 28. However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. The total shoes sold on Sunday is 28 - 12 = 16.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
28 (Friday) + 56 (Saturday) + 16 (Sunday) = 100.

The final answer is: 100"

"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we need to calculate the proportions of pupils who like blue, green, and yellow.

First, we know that half of the class likes blue, which is 50% of the total. This means 50% of 40 pupils like blue, which is 0.5 * 40 = 20 pupils.

The remaining pupils who do not like blue are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of these remaining pupils like green, which is 25% of the total. This is 0.25 * 20 = 5 pupils.

The total number of pupils who like blue and green is 20 + 5 = 25.

To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the total number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils: 40 - 25 = 15.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to work backwards from the information given.

We know that Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday at $4 per piece. This means she sold 14 apples on Monday (since $56 / $4 = 14).

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we add the number of apples picked on each day to find the total:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest and then divide it by the number of months.

The total interest is calculated as: Principal * Rate * Time
Principal = $3,650
Rate = 10% or 0.10
Time = 5 months

Total interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5 = $1,825

The total amount to be paid is the principal + interest = $3,650 + $1,825 = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
$5,475 / 5 = $1,095

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. So, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can make 36 cups in total, she will spend 36 / 4 = 9 hours selling all the lemonade.

The profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the number of girls. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

The total number of people performing is the number of girls minus the number of girls who couldn't make it, plus the number of teachers. So, the total number of people performing is 26 - 13 + 3 = 16.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To determine the cost-effectiveness of the ride options, let's break down the pricing structure.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, making the cost per ride $4. On the other hand, a ride bracelet offers 9 rides for $30, which translates to $30 / 9 = $3.33 per ride.

Since Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides at $4 per ride, her total cost is 9 * $4 = $36.

In contrast, David purchases a ride bracelet for $30, which covers the cost of 9 rides at $3.33 per ride.

To find the savings, we compare the cost of Dasha's ticket purchases to David's ride bracelet. The difference in cost is $36 - $30 = $6.

Therefore, David saves $6 by purchasing a ride bracelet instead of buying individual tickets.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of popsicles each person has. We know the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6 and the total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

Let's divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the ratio parts (5+6=11) to find the value of one part of the ratio. Then, we can multiply this value by the respective ratio parts to find the number of popsicles each person has.

The value of one part of the ratio = 165 / 11 = 15

Now, let's find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty's popsicles = 5 * 15 = 75
Sam's popsicles = 6 * 15 = 90

To find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty, we subtract the number of Betty's popsicles from Sam's popsicles:
Difference = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

To find the savings, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 - $26 = $34.

"To find out how many Valentine's cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Erica initially had 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she got 2 * 15 = 30 cards from her dad. 

Now, we add the cards she initially had to the cards her dad brought: 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

Next, we need to subtract the cards she passed out. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, we subtract the cards she gave away from the total: 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

Finally, we need to add the cards she received. She received 17 cards from family and friends, so we add 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate how many slices Jenny gave away. 

First, let's find out how many slices Jenny gave to Bill. Since she gave him 1/3 of the pizza, we multiply 1/3 by 12. To do this, we multiply the numerator (1) by 12 and keep the denominator (3) the same: (1 * 12) / 3 = 4 slices.

Next, let's find out how many slices Jenny gave to Mark. Since she gave him 1/4 of the pizza, we multiply 1/4 by 12. To do this, we multiply the numerator (1) by 12 and keep the denominator (4) the same: (1 * 12) / 4 = 3 slices.

Now, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark: 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny also ate 2 slices. To find the total number of slices she gave away and ate, we add 7 (slices given away) and 2 (slices eaten): 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

First, we find the number of millipedes, which is 1/3rd of the number of spiders. The number of spiders is 90, so we multiply 90 by 1/3.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the numerator (1) by the number and then divide by the denominator (3). So, 90 * 1 = 90, and then 90 / 3 = 30.

Next, we find the number of stink bugs, which is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. We already know the number of millipedes is 30, so we multiply 30 by 2 to get 60, and then subtract 12 to get 48.

Now that we have the number of spiders (90), millipedes (30), and stink bugs (48), we can find the total number of bugs by adding these three numbers together: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

Let's denote Erica's age as E, Beth's age as B, and Alice's age as A. We are given the following information:

1. A = B + 7 (Alice is 7 years older than Beth)
2. B = E + 5 (Beth is 5 years older than Erica)
3. E = 30 (Erica is 30 years old)

Substituting the value of E into equation 2, we get:
B = 30 + 5
B = 35

"To determine the number of bags of flour Mark needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of flour required for the quadruple batch of brownies. Since the normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour, we multiply this by 4 to get the total amount of flour needed.

Total flour required = 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide the total amount of flour required by the amount of flour in each bag to find the number of bags Mark needs to buy.

Number of bags of flour = 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags

Next, we calculate the total amount of milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies. The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk, so we multiply this by 4 to get the total amount of milk needed.

Total milk required = 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide the total amount of milk required by the amount of milk in each bottle to find the number of bottles Mark needs to buy.

Number of bottles of milk = 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk.

"To calculate the energy saved, we need to first convert the power consumption of the air conditioner from watts to kilowatts. Since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts, the 900-watt air conditioner uses 0.9 kilowatts of energy per hour.

Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, so the original energy used per day is 0.9 kilowatts * 8 hours = 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new energy used per day is 0.9 kilowatts * 3 hours = 2.7 kWh.

The energy saved per day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

"To determine the total cost of the ingredients for the muffaletta sandwiches, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Now that we know the number of sandwiches needed, we can calculate the total amount of ingredients required. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so we need a total of 5 pounds of each.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese.

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Allan initially has twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis. This means the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan then buys 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he bought 60 - 20 = 40 corns.

Now, we need to find the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house. To do this, we add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought:

Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 40
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 40 = 120
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 120 + 100 = 220.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's find the total time it will take Toby to read the book. The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words. Since Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, the time it will take him to read the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Next, we need to add the time it will take Toby to get to the airport, which is 10 minutes.

Total time = reading time + travel time = 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so to find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the time he arrives from the time he has to be there: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wages.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, resulting in a total of 160 hours per employee. With an hourly wage of $15, the total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, leaving 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 30 employees. Each of these employees worked 160 hours, and with an hourly wage of $15, the total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we add the amounts paid in May and June: $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

$168,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound of taffy is half off, so it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the magnets. There are 4 magnets, each costing $0.25, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add the cost of the seashells, which is $1.50. The total cost of the items Sally bought is $4.50 + $1 + $1.50 = $6.50.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $6.50 = $3.50 left.

The final answer is: $3.50"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework, then apply the discount.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

He gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, so the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is $960 (fireworks) + $150 (finale firework) = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first calculate the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply 2 by 30:

2 * 30 = 60

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies this is. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide 60 by 12:

60 Ã· 12 = 5

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50000 candles smell like wet dog, so the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 0.05. The number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are more dangerous and can explode. The probability of a candle being more dangerous is 1% or 0.01. The number of candles that are more dangerous is 0.01 * 50000 = 500.

Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities to find the probability of both events occurring. The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding is 0.05 * 0.01 = 0.0005.

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we multiply the total number of candles by the probability of both events occurring: 50000 * 0.0005 = 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'.

From the problem, we know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees (60) and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees (45). Since the sisters gather a combined total of 500 apples, we can set up the following equation:

30 (Joanne's tallest) + 15 (Joanne's shortest) + x (Joanne's average) + 60 (sister's tallest) + 45 (sister's shortest) = 500

This equation simplifies to:
45 + x + 105 = 500

We can solve for x by subtracting 150 from both sides of the equation:
x = 500 - 150
x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write the first equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the second equation:

2C + D = 304

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. We can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of C in both equations the same:

2C + 2D = 360

Now, we can subtract the second equation from this new equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 2D) - (2C + D) = 360 - 304
D = 56

Now that we have found the value of D, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the value of C:

C + 56 = 180
C = 124

However, the question asks for the number of dromedaries, so the final answer is:

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down his trip into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days. Since Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we need to find the distance traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.30 (since 30% is equivalent to 30/100 or 0.30):
(30/100) * 800 km = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

On the next day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to establish the relationships between the lockers based on the given information.

Let's start with Peter's locker, which is 5 cubic inches. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can express this as a ratio: 1/4 = 5 / x, where x is the size of Zack's locker.

To find x, we can cross-multiply: 1 * x = 4 * 5
x = 20 cubic inches (Zack's locker size)

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This can be expressed as a ratio: 1/2 = 20 / y, where y is the size of Timothy's locker.

To find y, we can cross-multiply: 1 * y = 2 * 20
y = 40 cubic inches (Timothy's locker size)

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb is, we need to determine the point where it landed after falling from his initial position. Since the comb fell 4,000 feet, we subtract this distance from Stanley's initial elevation of 10,000 feet.

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To find the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks. 

First, let's calculate the amount he received from the second bank, which is twice as much as the first bank. The first bank gave him $4000, so the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, let's add the amount he received from both banks: $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Finally, we add the initial capital to the total amount he received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. Now, the number of cats left on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30.
4. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.
5. The number of cats left on the rock is the remaining cats minus the cats that ran after the mouse: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods and calculate the cost for each period.

The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's dive into the problem.

We are given that the tattered jeans cost $28 and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's denote the cost of the jogger jeans as J and the cost of the tattered jeans as T. We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

We also know that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Substituting J from the first equation into the second equation, we get: (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we get: 3T - 6 = 18.

Adding 6 to both sides, we get: 3T = 24.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total capacity of the vehicles, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses: 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses: 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

Lastly, we calculate the capacity of the minivans: 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders. Lillian made 3 bird feeders, and each of these attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which attract 20 birds. So, each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Now, we multiply the number of homemade feeders by the number of birds they attract: 3 * 30 = 90.

Next, we find the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders. Lillian bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these attracts 20 birds. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

Finally, we add the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day: 90 + 60 = 150.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as x.

Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, so the number of cards he kept is 1/3 * x. He sold the remaining 2/3 of the cards, which is equal to 33.33 (round down to 33 since you can't sell a fraction of a card). 

We can set up the equation as follows:

2/3 * x = 33

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for these 18 guests.

For the other half of the guests (also 18), the caterer prepared 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs.

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were needed.

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. This means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we need to determine the number of letters in her sister's name first.

Let's denote the number of letters in Indras' name as I and the number of letters in her sister's name as S. We are given that I = 6.

We are also given that S is 4 more than half of I. We can represent this as S = (I / 2) + 4.

Substituting the value of I, we get S = (6 / 2) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add I and S: I + S = 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
- Set of pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils: 5 x $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost before discount: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we'll calculate the discount:
Discount = 20% of $165.00
Discount = 0.20 x $165.00
Discount = $33.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:
Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount
Total cost after discount = $165.00 - $33.00
Total cost after discount = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to determine the number of dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew first.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is calculated as 100 * (3/4) = 75.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 150 * (1/5) = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine the amount of gas in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Now, we convert 3 gallons to pints. Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the total amount in pints. To do this, we multiply 24 by 1/4.

24 * 1/4 = 24 * 0.25 = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of candy bars as 'c' and the number of bags of chips as 'b'. We know that George spent $5 in total, so we can write the equation:

40b + 75c = 500 (equation 1)

We also know that George had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. Since 1% of his money is equal to $0.01, 99% of his money is equal to $4.99. Therefore, we can write the equation:

40b + 75c = 499 (equation 2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

40b + 75c = 500
40b + 75c = 499

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

0 = 1

This is a contradiction, which means that the system of equations has no solution. However, we can try to find a solution that satisfies the first equation. 

Rearranging equation 1 to isolate b, we get:

b = (500 - 75c) / 40

Substituting this expression for b into equation 2, we get:

40((500 - 75c) / 40) + 75c = 499

Simplifying the equation, we get:

500 - 75c + 75c = 499

This simplifies to:

500 = 499

This is also a contradiction, which means that the system of equations has no solution. However, we can try to find a solution that satisfies the first equation.

Rearranging equation 1 to isolate b, we get:

b = (500 - 75c) / 40

We are given that George bought 3 bags of chips, so we can substitute b = 3 into the equation:

3 = (500 - 75c) / 40

Multiplying both sides by 40, we get:

120 = 500 - 75c

Subtracting 500 from both sides, we get:

-380 = -75c

Dividing both sides by -75, we get:

c = 5.0667

Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to perform two operations: subtraction and division.

First, we subtract the lollipops Ray kept from the total. He had 25 lollipops and kept 5, so the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Next, we divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends. There are 4 friends, so each friend received 20 / 4 = 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to determine how much cake was eaten by Rory and her mom. 

First, we divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces to find the weight of each piece. 

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find the total weight of the cake they ate. 

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

"To find the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, we need to determine the total cost of the onions. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of the ingredients by adding the cost of the onions and the cost of the beef stock: $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive. If Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, then Bernadette's drive takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to find the time difference between their arrival times. Let's denote the time Wayne leaves as t. Then, Bernadette needs to leave t - 5 minutes before Wayne.

The time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater is 4 minutes, and the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater is 16 minutes. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

t + 4 = (t - 5) + 16

Simplifying the equation, we get:

t + 4 = t - 5 + 16
t + 4 = t + 11
4 = 11 - t
4 + t = 11
t = 7

So, Wayne leaves at time t = 7. Since Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave at time 7 - 5 = 2.

The time difference between their departure times is 7 - 2 = 5 minutes. However, we need to find the time Bernadette needs to leave before Wayne arrives at the theater. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne arrives.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to find the width of the room. Given that the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet.

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we need to calculate the total number of beads each of them has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60

"To find the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the temperature changes caused by the oven and the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and it is on for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Next, we need to calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours, the house cools down 2 * 5 = 10 degrees.

Now, we can find the final temperature by adding the initial temperature to the temperature increase and subtracting the temperature decrease. The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees, the temperature increase due to the oven is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease due to the open window is 10 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 10 = 45 degrees.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find James' run time, we need to first determine his total time for the triathlon. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, bike time is 80 minutes, and run time is 50 minutes. So, Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Next, we need to find James' swim and bike times. James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's, which is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes. James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, which is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Movie C is 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes long.

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

Now, we need to find the length of Movie A, which is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To do this, we can divide the length of Movie B by 4: 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the amount of hay the horse eats, we first need to calculate the distance it runs. Given that the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 30 minutes is equivalent to 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled by multiplying the speed by the time: 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she has. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make with these eggs. Each glass needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we can find the total number of trays by dividing the total number of glasses by 5. This gives us 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many points Joey has after his turn, we need to add the points he scored to his initial points. 

Joey's initial points: 214
Points scored by Joey: 26

To find out how many points Marcy has after her turn, we need to add the points she scored to her initial points.

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10
Marcy's total points after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's total points and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning.

"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
$340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of crayons, we need to calculate the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each and the four packets with 16 pieces each.

First, let's find the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each: 6 * 8 = 48

Next, we'll find the total number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each: 4 * 16 = 64

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given two options for buying a movie ticket and snacks:

1. A super ticket for $20 that includes a movie ticket and a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. A regular ticket for $12 and a separate purchase of a soda and popcorn.

We are also given that the soda costs $3 and that buying the regular ticket and snacks costs $2 less than buying the super ticket.

Let's denote the cost of the popcorn as 'x'. The cost of the super ticket is $20, which includes the cost of the movie ticket, the soda ($3), and the popcorn ($x). The total cost of the super ticket is $20, so we can write the equation:

20 = 12 + 3 + x + 1

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 = 16 + x

Subtracting 16 from both sides of the equation, we get:

4 = x

However, this is the cost of the popcorn when buying the super ticket. We are asked to find the regular price of the popcorn, which is the cost of the popcorn when buying the regular ticket. Since buying the regular ticket and snacks costs $2 less than buying the super ticket, the cost of the popcorn when buying the regular ticket is $4 - $2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to determine the original cost of filling one balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can set up the equation 20x = 900. 

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45. 

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. 

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65. 

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. Multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11050.

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to consider the weighted average of the two segments of the trip. 

Weighted Average = (Weight of Segment 1 x Value of Segment 1 + Weight of Segment 2 x Value of Segment 2) / Total Weight
Weight of Segment 1 = Time of Segment 1 = 2 hours
Weight of Segment 2 = Time of Segment 2 = 1 hour
Total Weight = Weight of Segment 1 + Weight of Segment 2 = 2 + 1 = 3 hours
Value of Segment 1 = Speed of Segment 1 = 60 mph
Value of Segment 2 = Speed of Segment 2 = 30 mph

Weighted Average = (2 x 60 + 1 x 30) / 3
Weighted Average = (120 + 30) / 3
Weighted Average = 150 / 3
Weighted Average = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

First, let's determine the value of the sapphires she has left. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 for 2 rubies. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Next, we need to find the value of the rubies she received. Since she traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, the value of the rubies she received is equal to the value of the 3 sapphires she traded. The value of 3 sapphires is 3 * $800 = $2400. Since she received 2 rubies, the value of the rubies she received is $2400.

However, we can also calculate the value of the rubies she received by multiplying the number of rubies by their value: 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Since Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, let's multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30:

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions of each bed are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.

The volume of one bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"

Therefore, the correct answer is 45."
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to calculate the ratio of puppies with spots to the total number of puppies.

First, let's find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, so the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots, so the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of the feed. 

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds (2 boxes * 1 pound/box). 
The weight of the carrots is 48 pounds (4 bags * 12 pounds/bag). 
The weight of the hay is 3150 pounds (42 bales * 75 pounds/bale). 
The weight of the oats is 1300 pounds (20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack).

Now, we add the weights of all the feed together to get the total weight: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Next, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips: 3400 / 2250 = 1.511. Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number.

The farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To track Finley's position, we can use a series of positive and negative integers to represent her movements. 

She starts in 1st place, which we can represent as +0 (since she's already in her starting position). 

She then falls back 5 spots, so we subtract 5: 1 - 5 = -4. This means she's now 4 spots behind her original position.

Next, she moves ahead 2 spots, so we add 2: -4 + 2 = -2. This means she's now 2 spots behind her original position.

Then, she falls behind 3 spots, so we subtract 3: -2 - 3 = -5. This means she's now 5 spots behind her original position.

Lastly, she jumps ahead 1 spot to finish the race, so we add 1: -5 + 1 = -4. This means she's now 4 spots behind her original position.

Since we're tracking her position relative to the starting point, we can add 1 to get her final position: -4 + 1 = 5 - 1 = 4. However, since she is 4 spots behind the first place, we add 1 to get her final position: 4 + 1 = 5."
"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then divide that by the number of cards each student receives.

First, let's find the total number of basketball cards. She has 6 decks with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

Next, we'll find the total number of baseball cards. She has 5 boxes with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards to get the overall number of cards: 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, we subtract that from the total number of cards to find out how many cards she gives to her students: 350 - 50 = 300.

Finally, we divide the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives to find the number of students: 300 / 10 = 30.

"To determine how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples for each of them after applying the discounts.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. The total cost before the discount is 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents. After receiving a $1 discount, which is equivalent to 100 cents, Becky's total cost is 900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents. Converting this to dollars, we get 800 cents / 100 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. The total cost before the discount is 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents. A 10% discount on 1000 cents is 0.1 * 1000 cents = 100 cents. After applying the discount, Kelly's total cost is 1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents, which is equivalent to $9.

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we can use a Venn diagram to visualize the problem. Let's denote the set of kids allergic to dairy as D, the set of kids allergic to peanuts as P, and the set of kids allergic to both as B.

We know that |D| = 9, |P| = 6, and |B| = 3. We also know that the total number of kids in the class is 32.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts as |D âˆª P| = |D| + |P| - |B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12.

The number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is the complement of the set of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts, which is |(D âˆª P)'| = Total - |D âˆª P| = 32 - 12 = 20.

"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to find the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal. To find the new price, we need to calculate 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price. 20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. The new price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

"To find the total hours James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide that by his speed.

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. To find the total miles run in a week, we multiply the miles run per day by the number of days.

Total miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
= 60 miles/week

Now, we need to find the total hours James runs in a week. Since he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours by dividing the total miles run in a week by his speed.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats consumed over 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to determine how many 50-pound bags of oats are needed to feed the horses for 5 days. To do this, we divide the total amount of oats consumed (200 pounds) by the weight of each bag (50 pounds): 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for 5 days.

The total cost of the toy car is $12, and the child already has $4 in savings. 

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount.

Daily savings = $2
Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total number of eggs that can fit on the 2 trays and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs that can fit on the trays. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs and Jaime has 2 trays, we multiply the number of eggs per tray by the number of trays:
24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Now, we subtract the total number of eggs that can fit on the trays from the total number of eggs Jaime has:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors, which costs $4.00. However, she will buy 2 packs, so she will pay for 2 packs at the sale price, which is half the original price. The sale price of 2 packs is 2 * $4.00 / 2 = $4.00.

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

In four years, Brett will be 14 years old, and Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. This can be represented as:

A + 4 = 3(14)

To solve for A, we can start by distributing the 3:

A + 4 = 42

Next, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to isolate A:

A = 42 - 4
A = 38

Therefore, Angela's current age is 38 years old.

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the morning rides. Since Paul drives his car twice a day, and he does this for 14 days, we need to multiply the number of days by the cost of each morning ride. The cost of each morning ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 14 * 6 = $84.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides. Since Paul also drives his car twice a day, and he does this for 14 days, we need to multiply the number of days by the cost of each afternoon ride. The cost of each afternoon ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 14 * 2 = $28.

Now, let's add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides together to find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car. $84 + $28 = $112.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (per person charge).

We can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

Therefore, the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B, the number of insects David found as D, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write the equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write the equation: D = B/2.

Lastly, we know that together they collected 43 insects, so we can write the equation: L + D + B = 43.

Now we have a system of three equations with three variables:

1) L = D + 7
2) D = B/2
3) L + D + B = 43

We can substitute equation (1) into equation (3) to get: (D + 7) + D + B = 43

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36

Now we can substitute equation (2) into the equation above: 2(B/2) + B = 36

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36

Combine like terms: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for the friends who want 5 gifts each: 2 friends * 5 gifts = 10 gifts.
Next, let's calculate the number of gifts for the friends who want 2 gifts each: 3 friends * 2 gifts = 6 gifts.
Now, we add the number of gifts for both groups of friends: 10 gifts + 6 gifts = 16 gifts.
Finally, we add the 10 random gifts to the total number of gifts for the friends: 16 gifts + 10 gifts = 26 gifts.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the length of the couch, we need to determine the width of the rug first. Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, we can calculate the rug's width as follows:

Rug's width = Chair's width + 5
Rug's width = 3 + 5
Rug's width = 8 feet

Now, we know that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We can calculate this as follows:

Twice the rug's width = 2 * 8
Twice the rug's width = 16 feet
Couch's length = Twice the rug's width + 2
Couch's length = 16 + 2
Couch's length = 18 feet

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost is $7.

We can represent the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

Since the total cost is $7, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, we need to determine the optimal combination of 2 x 4 and 2 x 8 pieces of wood that Frederick can buy with his $24 budget.

Let's define the variables:
- x: number of 2 x 4 pieces of wood
- y: number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood

The objective function to maximize is the total number of popsicle sticks:
Maximize: 200x + 400y

The constraints are:
- Budget constraint: 4x + 6y â‰¤ 24 (since each 2 x 4 costs $4 and each 2 x 8 costs $6)
- Non-negativity constraint: x â‰¥ 0, y â‰¥ 0 (since we can't buy a negative number of pieces of wood)

To solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method or simplex method. However, in this case, we can also solve it by inspection.

Since 2 x 8 gives more sticks per dollar, we want to buy as many 2 x 8 pieces of wood as possible. Let's see how many 2 x 8 pieces we can buy with the budget:
24 / 6 = 4

So, we can buy 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood. This will use up the entire budget, leaving no money for 2 x 4 pieces of wood.

Now, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks:
4 * 400 = 1600

Therefore, the optimal solution is to buy 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1600}$"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, we multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs per dog: 6 * 4 = 24.

Next, we need to find the total number of snowshoes, which is half the total number of legs since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes. So, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To determine the weekly cost of bus trips, we need to multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of trips Janet takes in a week.

Cost of one bus trip: $2.20
Number of trips in a week: 5

Weekly cost of bus trips: $2.20 * 5 = $11.00

Now, let's calculate the amount Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20.

Weekly bus pass cost: $20
Weekly bus trip cost: $11.00

Amount saved: $20 - $11.00 = $9.00

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo, we need to determine the number of cows and sheep at each location.

The farm has 30 cows. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The zoo has 20 sheep. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

The total number of animals is the sum of the animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's dive into the problem. We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, and she bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the proportion:

x / (x + y) = 1 / 4

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so we can set up the equation:
12 / (x + y) = 1 / 4

Cross-multiplying:
4 * 12 = x + y
48 = x + y

We also know that the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is x + y. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:
x + y = 4(x + y)

Simplifying the equation:
x + y = 4x + 4y

Subtracting x from both sides:
y = 3x

Substituting y = 3x into the equation 48 = x + y:
48 = x + 3x
48 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4:
12 = x

Now that we know x = 12, we can find the value of y:
y = 3x
y = 3 * 12
y = 36

However, this is not possible since we know that Rose bought 4 potatoes. Let's re-examine the equation x + y = 4(x + y). We can simplify it as:
x + y = 4x + 4y

Subtracting x from both sides:
y = 3x

Substituting y = 3x into the equation 48 = x + y:
48 = x + 3x
48 = 4x

"To determine the daily calorie deficit required for Andy to reach his weight loss goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn. Since Andy wants to lose 30 pounds and it takes approximately 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calories he needs to burn is:

30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Next, we need to find out how many days Andy has to lose the weight. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Now, we can calculate the daily calorie deficit by dividing the total calories needed by the number of days:

105,000 calories / 171 days â‰ˆ 613.5 calories per day

To maintain a calorie deficit, Andy needs to consume fewer calories than he burns. Therefore, his daily calorie deficit should be approximately 613.5 calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{614}$"

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. To find the total number of bags, we multiply the number of packs by the number of bags per pack: 8 * 5 = 40 bags. Now, we multiply the total number of bags by the cost per bag: 40 * 4 = 160.

Next, let's find the total revenue. Tara sold each bag for $8. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of bags by the selling price per bag: 40 * 8 = 320.

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: 320 - 160 = 160.

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner:
   3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) * $80 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the time it takes Rob to shingle a house from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 2 hours by 60 to get 120 minutes.

Now, we are given that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Let's represent the time it takes Rob as R. Then, the time it takes Royce can be represented as 2R + 40.

We know that Rob takes 120 minutes, so we can substitute this value into the equation for Royce's time: 2(120) + 40.

Now, we can solve for Royce's time: 2(120) = 240, and 240 + 40 = 280.

Therefore, the time it takes Royce to shingle a house is 280 minutes.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total for each item and then add them together.

For hats, we have 3 children, and each hat requires 2 skeins of wool. So, the total number of skeins needed for hats is 3 * 2 = 6.

For scarves, we have 3 children, and each scarf requires 4 skeins of wool. So, the total number of skeins needed for scarves is 3 * 4 = 12.

For sweaters, we have 3 children, and each sweater requires 12 skeins of wool. So, the total number of skeins needed for sweaters is 3 * 12 = 36.

For mittens, we have 3 children, and each pair of mittens requires 1 skein of wool. So, the total number of skeins needed for mittens is 3 * 1 = 3.

For socks, we have 3 children, and each pair of socks requires 2 skeins of wool. So, the total number of skeins needed for socks is 3 * 2 = 6.

Now, let's add the total number of skeins needed for each item: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63.

The final answer is: 63"
"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of problems Chris completed on Tuesday. Since he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, and he completed 12 problems on Monday, we can find the number of problems completed on Tuesday by multiplying 12 by 3. This gives us 12 * 3 = 36 problems.

Now, let's add the number of problems completed on Monday and Tuesday to find the total number of problems completed by Tuesday. This is 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

Next, we need to find out how many problems Chris has left to complete after Tuesday. Since he has a total of 100 problems to complete, we can subtract the number of problems completed by Tuesday from the total. This gives us 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

Now, let's calculate the number of problems Chris completed on Wednesday. He completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

To find the total number of problems completed by Wednesday, we add the number of problems completed on Tuesday and Wednesday. This is 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

Finally, we can find the number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday by subtracting the total number of problems completed by Wednesday from the total number of problems. This gives us 100 - 61 = 39 problems.

The final answer is: 39"
"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to determine the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. 
Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

"To find the number of loaves of bread left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves baked.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold. The bakers sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. 

Total loaves sold = 93 + 39 = 132

Now, let's subtract the total number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves baked.

Total loaves baked = 200
Loaves returned = 6

Total loaves left = 200 - 132 - 6 = 62

The number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"To find the number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to divide the total number of each type of tulip by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

For red tulips: 36 Ã· 6 = 6
For blue tulips: 24 Ã· 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be used for the granola and snack mix. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. So, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

First, let's calculate the weekly consumption before and after adding the device. 

Daily consumption before adding the device: 12 kilowatts per hour
Weekly consumption before adding the device: 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour

Daily consumption after adding the device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour
Weekly consumption after adding the device: 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour

Now, let's calculate the cost before and after adding the device. The cost per kilowatt hour is $1.50.

Cost before adding the device: 84 * $1.50 = $126
Cost after adding the device: 98 * $1.50 = $147

The difference in weekly electric bill: $147 - $126 = $21

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the rate at which one person paints a house and then scale it up to five people.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate their rate as follows: 

Rate = Work / Time = 0.5 house / 5 days = 0.1 house per day.

Now, we need to find the combined rate of five people. Since rate is directly proportional to the number of people, we can multiply the rate of one person by 5:

Combined rate = 0.1 house per day * 5 people = 0.5 house per day.

Since we want to find the time it takes for five people to paint a whole house, we can use the formula: Time = Work / Rate. 

Time = 1 house / 0.5 house per day = 2 days.

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, the correct answer is 48 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"Let's denote the number of sofas Ophelia has as S and the number of chairs she has as C. We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so S = C - 2.
2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can find the number of chairs Ophelia has by setting up the equation 3C = 20 + 2, which simplifies to 3C = 22. Solving for C, we get C = 22 / 3, but since C must be an integer, we know that Ophelia has 22 chairs and 20 sofas.

Now, let's find the number of sofas Jenna has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, she has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs. We are also given that Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. 

Let's start by finding out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. If we let x be the number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set, then we can set up the equation:

4x = 44

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 44 / 4
x = 11

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CD. If we let y be the number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CD, then we can set up the equation:

4y = 48

To solve for y, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

y = 48 / 4
y = 12

Now, let's find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. This is simply the difference between the number of CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the number of CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CD:

Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = y - x
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 12 - 11
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 1

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the different scenarios. 

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours. There are 6 weeks where he spent 4 hours. 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

Next, we'll calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 5 hours. There are 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

Then, we'll calculate the total hours for the week where he spent 6 hours. There is 1 week where he spent 6 hours.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add up the total hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. To find the number of passengers left, we subtract 8 from 48:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus. Since 5 times 8 is 40, the total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. To find the number of passengers left, we subtract 21 from 80:
80 - 21 = 59

Now, we need to find the number of passengers who get on at the second stop. It's given that 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 3 times 21 is 63, 63 fewer passengers get on. However, since we are looking for the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. So, 21 - 63 = -42. Since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that 63 more passengers got on.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is:
59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"Let's denote Jame's current age as J and his cousin's current age as C. We are given two pieces of information:

1. In 5 years, Jame will turn 27, so his current age is J = 27 - 5 = 22.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. This can be expressed as the equation: C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5.

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

J = 22
C + 8 = 2J + 8 - 5

We can simplify the second equation by combining like terms:
C + 8 = 2J + 3

Now, substitute J = 22 into the second equation:
C + 8 = 2(22) + 3
C + 8 = 47

Subtract 8 from both sides to solve for C:
C = 47 - 8
C = 39

Now that we have the values of J and C, we can find the difference between their ages:
Difference = J - C
          = 22 - 39
          = -17

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference:
Difference = | -17 |
          = 17

The final answer is: 17"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of the computer as C, the cost of the printer as P, and the cost of one monitor as M.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. C + 2M + P = 2400 (Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer)
2. C - P = 400 (The printer cost $400 less than the computer)
3. C = 1100 (Given cost of the computer)

We can use equation (3) to substitute the value of C in equation (2) to find the cost of the printer:
P = C - 400
P = 1100 - 400
P = 700

Now that we have the cost of the printer, we can substitute the values of C and P in equation (1) to find the cost of one monitor:
1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400
Combine like terms:
1800 + 2M = 2400
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
2M = 600
Divide both sides by 2:
M = 300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to first determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys and each brought 60 seashells, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

Next, we need to calculate the number of seashells brought by the girls. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 seashells.

First, we calculate 4 * 60, which is 240. Then, we add 60 to this result, which equals 300. So, the girls brought 300 more seashells than the boys.

To find the total number of seashells brought by the girls, we add the number of seashells brought by the boys to the additional seashells brought by the girls. This equals 600 + 300 = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's analyze the situation: Nick had twice as many candies as George. Then George ate 5 candies. Now George has 3 candies left. We can represent the initial number of candies George had as x. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies initially.

After George ate 5 candies, he was left with x - 5 candies. However, we know that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation x - 5 = 3 to find the initial number of candies George had.

Solving for x, we get x = 8. Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

"To find Anne's age, we need to determine Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we subtract 4 from Chenny's age to get Alyana's age.

Chenny's age = 10
Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we add 2 to Alyana's age to get Anne's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

"To find the final amount the eldest boy has, we need to follow the sequence of events described in the problem.

First, we need to determine the eldest boy's initial share. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find his initial share: $18 / 3 = $6.

Next, the eldest boy adds $5 to his share, resulting in $6 + $5 = $11.

Then, he adds another $10 to his share, bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21.

However, he later spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he triples the amount he had left after spending the $8, resulting in $13 * 3 = $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of days in the first half of April as x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's denote the amount saved in the first half as y. Then, the amount saved in the second half will be 2y.

The total amount saved in the first half is xy, and the total amount saved in the second half is 2xy. The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation: 3xy = 1125.

Since x is the number of days in the first half, and the total number of days in April is 30, we can write x + (30 - x) = 30, which simplifies to 30 = 30. This equation is true for any value of x, but we can use it to find the value of x. We know that x + (30 - x) = 30, so we can rewrite this as 2x = 30 - x, which simplifies to 3x = 30, and x = 10.

Now we can substitute x = 10 into the equation 3xy = 1125 to find y: 3(10)y = 1125, which simplifies to 30y = 1125.

To find y, we divide both sides by 30: y = 1125 / 30 = 37.5.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2y = 2(37.5) = 75.

The final answer is: $75"

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters she wrote initially, and the 13 letters she wrote next. So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. So, the total number of letters she has written is 65 + 65 = 130.

For the initial $1000, the commission rate is 30%. This is calculated as 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For the sales above $1000, the commission rate increases to 10%. The amount above $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500. The additional commission is then 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

To find the total commission, we add the commission for the initial $1000 and the additional commission: $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella's total earnings are $450.

The final answer is: $450"
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of bottles required for his guests. Since he wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, we multiply 70 by 2.

70 * 2 = 140

Next, we need to find out how many bottles Bill already has. He started with 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. So, we multiply 2 by 24.

2 * 24 = 48

Now, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles he needs to find out how many more he needs to buy.

140 - 48 = 92

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day, and then calculate the difference in time between the two.

First, let's find out how long Ray takes to swim a mile on a hot day. We know that when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does on a cold day. 

Time to swim a mile on a cold day = 16 minutes
Twice the time = 2 * 16 = 32 minutes
Time to swim a mile on a hot day = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we can find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day.

Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes
Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes

Now, we can find the difference in time between the two days.

Difference in time = Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day - Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day
= 102 - 48
= 54 minutes

The final answer is: 54"

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to find the size of Zack's locker first, and then find 1/4 of that size.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can express this as a fraction: Zack's locker is 1/2 * Timothy's locker. Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can calculate Zack's locker size as follows:

Zack's locker = 1/2 * 24 = (1/2) * 24 = 24/2 = 12 cubic inches.

Now, to find Peter's locker size, we need to find 1/4 of Zack's locker size. This can be expressed as a fraction: Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker. Given that Zack's locker is 12 cubic inches, we can calculate Peter's locker size as follows:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * 12 = (1/4) * 12 = 12/4 = 3 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Octavia's and Juan's coffee intake. We are given that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks.

Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as x. 
Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.
Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

We are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. 
So, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

"To determine the final angle from the ground to the sun, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the angular displacement of the sun over time.

Given:
- Initial angle of the pyramid: 32 degrees
- Angular velocity of the sun: 5 degrees per hour
- Time the sun moves: 10 hours

The angular displacement of the sun can be calculated by multiplying its angular velocity by the time it moves: 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we add the initial angle of the pyramid to the angular displacement of the sun: 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 82 degrees.

"To find the total number of candles needed, we need to add the ages of the two sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

The total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20.

Since a pack of candles contains 5 candles, we need to find out how many packs are required. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate her reading total for each week separately.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew. 

Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x. 

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7. 

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.
This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.
This simplifies to x = 10.

"Let's break down the problem into a system of linear equations to find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. R = M + 20 (Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark)
2. R = A + 45 (Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna)
3. R = 80 (Richie scored 80 goals)

We can substitute the value of R from equation 3 into equations 1 and 2:

1. 80 = M + 20
2. 80 = A + 45

Now, let's solve for M and A:

1. M = 80 - 20
   M = 60
2. A = 80 - 45
   A = 35

Now that we have the values of M and A, we can find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers:

Total goals = M + A + R
Total goals = 60 + 35 + 80
Total goals = 175

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

First, let's find the total number of roses ordered per week: 
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total number of roses ordered per week by 4 to find the total number of roses ordered per month: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Next, we need to find out how many roses Ford grows per month. Since he grows 40 roses every week, we multiply this number by 4 to find the total number of roses he grows per month: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

Now, we subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month to find out how many roses he lacks: 
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

"To determine the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich.

The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. To find the cost per sandwich, we divide the cost by the number of sandwiches: $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the bread cost and the cheese and condiments cost: $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.

Since they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, the total revenue is 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00.

The total cost for 10 sandwiches is 10 sandwiches * $3.30 per sandwich = $33.00.

The net profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: $70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two variables: the number of cups Judy brought (C) and the number of dishes Judy brought (D). We know that Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. We also know that she bought twice as many dishes as cups, so D = 2C.

We are given that her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. This can be represented as C + 20 = 40 for the cups and D + 20 = 44 for the dishes.

Now, we can solve the system of linear equations. We can start by solving the first equation for C: C = 40 - 20 = 20. 

Now that we know C, we can find D: D = 2C = 2 * 20 = 40.

However, we can also solve the system of linear equations by substituting D = 2C into the second equation: 2C + 20 = 44. Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us 2C = 24. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us C = 12.

Now that we know C, we can find D: D = 2C = 2 * 12 = 24.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 
Judy's cups: 20
Judy's dishes: 40
Total Judy brought: 20 + 40 = 60

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 
Friend's cups: 40

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to first determine the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have. Since 90 single use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day.

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

The total number of days the contacts will last is:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, he will use a total of 180 contacts.

The cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is:
2 boxes * $100/box = $200
10% discount = $200 * 0.10 = $20
$200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories burned from her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

Next, she spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour. Therefore, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

Now, we add the calories burned from aerobics and running to find the total calories burned. 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units there are. 1600 / 200 = 8.

Finally, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 to find the total amount of water needed. 8 * 100 = 800.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
B + R + G = 4500

We also know that R is 1% fewer than B, which can be expressed as:
R = 0.99B

Additionally, we know that G is 1% more than B:
G = 1.01B

Now, we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3.01B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3.01:
B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to add up all the measurements and divide by 3.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM.
His second typing speed is 52 WPM.
His third typing speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, let's add up all the measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then subtract the weight gained from the weight lost.

Weight lost per week: -1.25 pounds
Weight gained per week: 1.75 pounds

Weight change after 5 weeks:
-1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds (lost)
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds (gained)

Difference in weight: 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to break down the information given.

First, let's consider the people invited via email. Each of the 100 invited people will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, we need to consider the people invited by Alex's friends. She calls 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. This means 10 friends will be attending, and 8 spouses will also be attending, for a total of 10 + 8 = 18 people.

Now, we need to add the total number of people invited via email and the people invited by Alex's friends. This gives us 300 + 18 = 318.

However, this count includes Alex herself, so we need to add 1 to the total to account for her.

Therefore, the total number of people attending the event is 318 + 1 = 319.

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first. 

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. 
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day. We need to find the number of days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Let's represent the height of the beanstalk on day n as 4 * 2^(n-1), where n is the number of days. We want to find the smallest value of n such that 4 * 2^(n-1) > 20.

We can rewrite the inequality as 2^(n-1) > 5. To solve for n, we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides: n - 1 > log2(5).

Now, we can solve for n: n > log2(5) + 1.

Using a calculator, we find that log2(5) â‰ˆ 2.3219. Therefore, n > 2.3219 + 1 â‰ˆ 3.3219.

Since n must be an integer (we can't have a fraction of a day), the smallest value of n that satisfies the inequality is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the amount of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the protein content in the mushrooms he eats daily and then multiply it by 7.

First, we find the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can set up a ratio: 100 grams of mushrooms : 3 grams of protein. To find the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms, we can multiply the ratio by 2: (100 grams * 2) : (3 grams * 2) = 200 grams : 6 grams.

Now that we know John eats 200 grams of mushrooms with 6 grams of protein per day, we can find the weekly protein intake by multiplying the daily protein intake by 7: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since he needs 2 implants, the total base price is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the smallest angle as x.

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents.

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 + 8 + 20 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to 8 pounds gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than this, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. Additionally, he buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 24 = 29 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 48 = 53 games in the third year.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve gets in 3 years: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games.

The final answer is: 104"
"To determine the time it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we need to establish the plane's rate of travel. 

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate its rate as follows:

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. Since he makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, we can calculate his hourly rate by dividing the total pounds by the number of hours: 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. It's given that she makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. To find Marissa's hourly rate, we multiply Ruiz's hourly rate by 3/4: 60 pounds/hour * (3/4) = 45 pounds/hour.

Now that we have the hourly rates for both Ruiz and Marissa, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. Ruiz's total is 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds, and Marissa's total is 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.

To find the total amount of chocolates they made together, we add their individual totals: 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent at the arcade and subtract it from the original amount.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount:
$100 - $88 = $12.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total amount earned from each period, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount earned from the first four hours. Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
Total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total amount earned in 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

Next, let's calculate the total amount earned from the next two hours. Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total amount earned in 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, let's add the total amount earned from both periods to find the total amount earned in 6 hours.
Total amount earned in 6 hours = $30 + $12 = $42

"To determine the lifespan of the tires in years, we need to calculate the total number of rotations they can handle and then divide that by the number of rotations per month.

First, let's find the total number of rotations per year. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can find the rotations per mile by dividing 725 by 2.

Rotations per mile = 725 rotations / 2 miles
Rotations per mile = 362.5 rotations/mile

Now, we can find the total rotations per year by multiplying the rotations per mile by the total miles driven per year.

Miles driven per year = 400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year
Rotations per year = 362.5 rotations/mile * 4800 miles/year = 1,745,000 rotations/year

Next, we need to find the total number of years the tires can last before they need to be replaced.

Total rotations allowed = 10,440,000 rotations
Rotations per year = 1,745,000 rotations/year

Years before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per year
Years before replacement = 10,440,000 / 1,745,000
Years before replacement = 5.96

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the tires will last approximately 6 years before needing to be replaced.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the cost per pump of the shampoo, we need to convert the total cost from dollars to cents and then divide it by the total number of pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100, since there are 100 cents in a dollar: 24.00 * 100 = 2400 cents.

The directions say that 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash. Therefore, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

Now, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the total cost in cents by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the discount and then add the prices of the shirt and shorts.

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt: 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt:
Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
Total cost = Discounted price of the shirt + Price of the shorts
Total cost = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since Joe has $50 and the total cost is $52.50, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount Joe has:
Amount left = $50 - $52.50 = -$2.50

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.50"
"To determine the total amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we multiply the number of dozen croissants by the number of days in a week.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Now, we convert the total number of dozen croissants to individual croissants:
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Next, we calculate the amount of butter needed per croissant. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the amount of butter per croissant, we divide the amount of butter per dozen by 12:
(1/4 pound) / 12 = 1/48 pound/croissant

Now, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per croissant:
336 croissants * (1/48 pound/croissant) = 7 pounds

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to consider the initial funding and the increased funding for the remaining months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000. 

For the remaining 45 months, the funding is 50% more than the initial funding, which is $150,000 per month.

The total cost for the remaining 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

However, since the funding for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial funding, we need to calculate the total cost using the formula for compound growth:

Total Cost = Initial Cost + (Increased Cost * Number of Months)

"To calculate the total amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to consider the frequency of laundry, the volume of water used per load, and the cost of a gallon of water.

Gary does laundry twice a week, which translates to 52 * 2 = 104 times in a year.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. To find the total water usage in a year, we multiply the frequency of laundry by the volume of water per load: 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

Since the cost of a gallon of water is $0.15, we can find the total cost by multiplying the total water usage by the cost per gallon: 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, we divide the total school hours by 2 to find the number of pieces chewed at school.
8 hours / 2 = 4 pieces of gum

Next, we add the pieces he chews on the way home and after dinner, which is 1 piece each, totaling 2 pieces.
4 pieces (at school) + 2 pieces (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces

Now, we subtract the total pieces chewed from the initial 20 pieces to find the remaining gum.
20 - 6 = 14 pieces

However, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find half of 14, we divide 14 by 2.
14 / 2 = 7

Since Jim's sister takes 7 pieces, we subtract that from the remaining gum to find the final amount.
14 - 7 = 7

"To convert kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per hour (Mb/h), we need to perform a two-step conversion.

First, we convert kilobits to megabits. Since 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb), we divide the given speed in kb/s by 1000 to get the speed in Mb/s.

Given speed: 20 kb/s
Speed in Mb/s: 20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Next, we convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h.

Speed in Mb/h: 0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h."

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the price of the diamond Jewell as D, the price of the gold Jewell as G, and the price of the silver Jewell as S.

We are given that the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell, so we can write the equation:

G = (4/5)D

We are also given that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can write the equation:

S = G - 400

Additionally, we know that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, so we can write the equation:

D = 2000

Now we can substitute the value of D into the first equation to find the price of the gold Jewell:

G = (4/5)(2000)
= 1600

Now that we have the value of G, we can substitute it into the second equation to find the price of the silver Jewell:

S = 1600 - 400
= 1200

Now that we have the prices of all three jewels, we can find the total price by adding them together:

Total price = D + G + S
= 2000 + 1600 + 1200
= 4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of truck and rose stamps first.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Max bought: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"To determine the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider their relative speed and the distance between them.

Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob as 't' hours. Since they are moving in the same direction, we can calculate the relative speed as the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.

The distance between them is 75 miles. Since Tom is catching up, the distance covered by Tom in time 't' is equal to the distance between them, which is 75 miles. We can set up the equation based on the formula Distance = Speed * Time.

For Tom, the distance covered is 70t (since his speed is 70 mph), and for Bob, the distance covered is 55t (since his speed is 55 mph). Since they are 75 miles apart initially, the equation becomes:

70t - 55t = 75

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15t = 75

Dividing both sides by 15, we get:

t = 5

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: 5"

Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Now, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. We know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we can add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.

Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

"To find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's start by finding the total cost of classes at $6 per class. 

Total cost of classes = Number of classes * Cost per class
Total cost of classes = 10 * 6
Total cost of classes = $60

Since Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's say Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and y classes at $10 per class. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

6x + 10y = 60

We can solve for y in terms of x.

y = (60 - 6x) / 10
y = 6 - 0.6x

Since y must be a whole number (Manny can't attend a fraction of a class), we need to find the maximum whole number value of x.

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 0, y = 6 (whole number)
If x = 1, y = 5.4 (not a whole number)
If x = 2, y = 4.8 (not a whole number)
If x = 3, y = 4.2 (not a whole number)
If x = 4, y = 3.6 (not a whole number)
If x = 5, y = 3 (whole number)
If x = 6, y = 2.4 (not a whole number)
If x = 7, y = 1.8 (not a whole number)
If x = 8, y = 1.2 (not a whole number)
If x = 9, y = 0.6 (not a whole number)
If x = 10, y = 0 (whole number)

Since x = 10 is the maximum value of x that results in a whole number solution for y, Manny can attend 10 classes at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

However, this would mean that Manny attends all 10 classes at $6 per class, which is not the answer we are looking for. We want to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Now, we're told that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. This means that Julie's daily production is 2 times Jewel's daily production, which is 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

To find Julie's weekly production, we multiply her daily production by 7: 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of miles Lynn ran as 'L', the number of miles Reggie ran as 'R', and the number of miles Paisley ran as 'P'.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles, so P = 4.

We also know that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so R = 5P = 5 * 4 = 20.

Additionally, Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so R = L + 3. Substituting the value of R, we get 20 = L + 3.

Now, we can solve for L by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: L = 20 - 3 = 17.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"Let's break down the problem into two separate equations to find the cost per item and then calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

Let's denote the cost of one apple as 'a' and the cost of one orange as 'o'. We have two equations based on the given information:

1) 4a = 5.20
2) 3o = 3.30

To find the cost of one apple, we'll solve equation 1 for 'a':
a = 5.20 / 4
a = 1.30

To find the cost of one orange, we'll solve equation 2 for 'o':
o = 3.30 / 3
o = 1.10

Now that we have the cost of one apple and one orange, we can find the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
Total cost = 5a + 5o
Total cost = 5(1.30) + 5(1.10)
Total cost = 6.50 + 5.50
Total cost = 12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To calculate the time it takes to dig the hole, we first need to find the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole, is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. To find the total time it takes to dig the hole, we multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

First, we add the base price and the king cab upgrade: $30,000 + $7,500 = $37,500.
Next, we add the cost of the leather seats: $37,500 + $2,500 = $40,000.
Then, we add the cost of the running boards: $40,000 + $2,000 = $42,000.
Finally, we add the cost of the upgraded exterior light package: $42,000 + $1,500 = $43,500.

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find Tim's new monthly salary, we need to calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary. This is done by multiplying 5% (or 0.05) by $20,000, which equals $1,000. Adding this to his original salary gives us a new monthly salary of $21,000.

Next, we calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary. This is found by dividing $20,000 by 2, resulting in a bonus of $10,000.

Now, we add the new monthly salary and the bonus to find the total monthly income: $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

To find the total annual income, we multiply the total monthly income by 12: $31,000 * 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them up.

First, let's find the cost of the suits: 10 suits * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to find the cost of the dress pants. Since they cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit, we can calculate this as: 1/5 * $750 = $150. Then, we multiply this by the number of dress pants: 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's find the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits, so he buys a total of 10 * 3 = 30 shirts. Each shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

Finally, we add up the costs of all the items: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company is 10 * 28 = 280 articles.

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites: 560 + 280 = 840 articles.

The final answer is: 840"
"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know Steve's age is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Next, their son is half as old as his mom, which means he is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Now, we need to find the age of Steve's son's wife. We know she is 3 years younger than her husband, so we subtract 3 from his age: 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to consider the different rates at which he can dig through soil and clay.

Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil. Since he has to dig through 24 feet of soil, the time it takes to dig through the soil is 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

He can dig half as fast through clay, which means his rate is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. Since he has to dig through 8 feet of clay, the time it takes to dig through the clay is 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

To find the total time, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two costs.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off because she had a voucher. So, the total cost is:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is:
20 * $30 = $600
The discount is 10% of $600, which is:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
So, the total cost with the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$540 - $398 = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's dive into the problem.

Ariadne has a shop selling hats of two different colors, red and green. Her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. This means the total sales from green hats in that month are twice the sales from red hats, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

To find the total sales in that month, we add the sales from red and green hats: $400 + $800 = $1200.

Now, let's consider the second month. Her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the sales in the second month, we multiply the total sales of the first month by 3/4: 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To calculate the total cost of the horse-drawn carriage, we need to determine the number of paid hours and the cost of each hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

So, the total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since each whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the number of eggs needed.

Number of deviled egg halves: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To find the number of dozens of eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12.

"To find the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we need to determine 2/3 of the total pages since she has already finished 1/3 of the paper.

The total number of pages is 15. To find 1/3 of 15, we multiply 15 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 15 by 3.

15 Ã· 3 = 5

So, Shiela has already written 5 pages. To find the number of pages left to write, we subtract the number of pages already written from the total number of pages.

Pages left to write = Total pages - Pages already written
Pages left to write = 15 - 5
Pages left to write = 10

"To find the total cost of the plane, we need to consider the initial purchase price, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly hanger rental is $5,000. To find the total hanger rental cost for a year, we multiply this by 12: $5,000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000. To find the total fuel cost for a year, we multiply this by 12: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add the initial purchase price, the hanger rental cost, and the fuel cost to find the total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the cooking times of rice, pork, and beans. Let's denote the cooking time of rice as R, the cooking time of pork as P, and the cooking time of beans as B.

From the given information, we know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so R = 30.

We are also told that it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. This can be expressed as P = R + 20. Substituting the value of R, we get P = 30 + 20 = 50.

Lastly, we know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is R + P, which is 30 + 50 = 80. Half of 80 is 40, so B = 80 / 2 = 40.

Now, we need to find the total cooking time, which is the sum of the cooking times of rice, pork, and beans. This can be expressed as R + P + B.

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get 30 + 50 + 40 = 120.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

We have two equations:

1) 4S + 2G = 70 (total number of legs)
2) S + G = 20 (total number of heads)

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

"To determine the total number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

Now, we need to divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn a new recipe, which is 1.5 hours. 

To perform this division, we can multiply the divisor (1.5) by the reciprocal of the dividend (48), which is 48 * (1/1.5). 

First, we can simplify the fraction 1/1.5 by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2, resulting in 2/3.

Now, we can multiply 48 by 2/3, which is the same as (48 * 2) / 3.

48 * 2 = 96

We are given that Aurelia has $120. We also know that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. To find Kassidy's amount, we can multiply Aurelia's amount by 3/4.

Kassidy's amount = (3/4) * 120
Kassidy's amount = 90

Now, we are given that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. To find Rayna's amount, we can add 60 to Kassidy's amount.

Rayna's amount = Kassidy's amount + 60
Rayna's amount = 90 + 60
Rayna's amount = 150

Now that we have the amounts for all three individuals, we can find the total amount of money they have together.

Total amount = Aurelia's amount + Kassidy's amount + Rayna's amount
Total amount = 120 + 90 + 150
Total amount = 360

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the money equally, we can divide the total amount by 3.

"Let's analyze the given information about Christina's mood recordings.

We know that Christina recorded her mood every day for thirty days. The first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral. This accounts for 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 days.

Since there are 30 days in total, the remaining days are 30 - 24 = 6 days.

The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, which accounts for 3 days. This leaves 6 - 3 = 3 days.

However, we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month. We already know that the first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good. So, the total number of good days is 8 + 3 = 11. But we also know that Christina had 12 good days in total. Therefore, the number of good days left is 12 - 11 = 1.

However, we also know that the first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good, and we are left with 6 days. We know that 3 of those 6 days were not good, so the remaining 6 - 3 = 3 days must be good.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 3.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

The number of books Sally has is 9."
"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can set up a linear equation to find the number of days (x) it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches:

30x = 360

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 30:

x = 360 / 30
x = 12

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 4 + 8 = 12.

When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. The total number of dogs is now 4 + 8 + 16 = 28. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12 + 28 = 40.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 40 - 3 = 37.

So, Frances invested $480. Now, let's find out how much money was left after Frances' investment.

Remaining amount after Frances' investment: 720 - 480 = 240

Skyler's investment is the remaining amount after Dylan and Frances invested. Therefore, Skyler's investment is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine how many signatures they have in total so far. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

They want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. Since they already have 64 signatures, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to collect.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal.

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

The sisters need to collect 36 signatures in total to reach their goal, and they need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks of their summer vacation."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to calculate the total hours Karen works in two days. Given that she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish a ratio between the number of potatoes and the number of hash browns. Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows:

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Cross-multiplying, we get:

6x = 96 * 36
6x = 3456
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: 576"
"To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults. 

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the difference between the total weight of the 9 adults and the maximum load.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem into a system of linear equations to find the total number of cookies.

Let's denote the number of cookies Max has as M, the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as C, and the number of cookies Summer has as S.

We are given the following information:
1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: K = M - 5
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: M = C + 12
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: S = M + 23
4. Katarina has 68 cookies: K = 68

We can substitute the value of K from equation 4 into equation 1 to find the value of M:
68 = M - 5
M = 68 + 5
M = 73

Now that we have the value of M, we can find the value of C using equation 2:
73 = C + 12
C = 73 - 12
C = 61

Finally, we can find the value of S using equation 3:
S = M + 23
S = 73 + 23
S = 96

Now, we add up the number of cookies each person has:
K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

The final answer is: 298"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to set up an equation that accounts for the 50% extension and the additional 20cm of lace trim.

Let's call the original length 'x'. The 50% extension is equivalent to 0.5x. Adding the 20cm of lace trim gives us a total added length of 0.5x + 20.

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: x + (0.5x + 20) = 140.

Combine like terms: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120.

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To calculate the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to find the weighted average of the time intervals for ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes.

The time for ""turtle"" mode is 60 minutes, and the time for ""rabbit"" mode is 40 minutes. Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we assign a weight of 0.5 to each mode.

Weighted average = (0.5 * 60) + (0.5 * 40)
Weighted average = 30 + 20
Weighted average = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the remaining time after subtracting the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have.

First, let's add the time it takes to get to the fire station: 6 minutes (to the corner where the library is) + 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 19 minutes.

Now, let's perform the subtraction: Total time they have (30 minutes) - Time to get to the fire station (19 minutes) = 30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total amount Catherine paid, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 * $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 + $4 = $8, then $8 + $6 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find the total number of cookies, we need to add the number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, which is 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

After eating 10 cookies, we need to subtract 10 from the total number of cookies to find out how many are left in the box. 

90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

We have two equations based on the given information:

1. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, we need to find the age of the older twin. 

The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"
"To determine the time John has available for a nap, we need to calculate the total time he has before dinner and subtract the time he spends on homework.

First, let's convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Next, let's add up the time John spends on homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

The correct answer is 100 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of one lollipop as L and the cost of one candy as C.

We have two equations based on the given information:

1) 5L + 4C = 3.20 (The total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20)
2) L = 0.40 (The cost of one lollipop is $0.40)

We can substitute the value of L from equation (2) into equation (1):

5(0.40) + 4C = 3.20
2.00 + 4C = 3.20

Now, we can solve for C:

4C = 3.20 - 2.00
4C = 1.20
C = 1.20 / 4
C = 0.30

Now that we have the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

Cost of 10 lollipops = 10 * 0.40 = 4.00
Cost of 10 candies = 10 * 0.30 = 3.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"

First, let's establish the cost of each fruit. One apple costs $0.5, one banana costs twice as much, so $1, and one orange costs three times as much as a banana, which is $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

First, let's determine the number of blue squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, and there are 14 red squares, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

Next, we find the number of green squares. There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

Now, we calculate the number of white squares. There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Finally, we add the number of squares of each color together: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

The total number of squares is 68. Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To determine the number of chairs Mia's restaurant needs to get, we first need to find out the total number of chairs available. We know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs.

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Total number of chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

Now, we need to find out the total number of chairs needed. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function.

Total number of chairs needed = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs needed.

Number of chairs needed to be added = Total number of chairs needed - Total number of chairs available
= 57 - 48
= 9

"To find the total points collected by the class, we need to determine the points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 0.3 by 50, which equals 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. To find Tom's points, we subtract 30 from Betty's points: 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. To find Martha's points, we multiply Tom's points by 3: 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, we add up the points collected by each student: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4:
300 * 0.4 = 120

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard display. She will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard display is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display:
120 + 15 = 135

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the capacity of Gissela's truck as G, Gordy's truck as H, and Gary's truck as Y.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. G = 4000 (Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel)
2. H = G + 800 (Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck)
3. G + H + Y = 11600 (The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds)

We can substitute the value of G from equation 1 into equation 2 to get:
H = 4000 + 800
H = 4800

Now, we can substitute the values of G and H into equation 3 to solve for Y:
4000 + 4800 + Y = 11600
8800 + Y = 11600

Subtract 8800 from both sides:
Y = 11600 - 8800
Y = 2800

The final answer is: $\boxed{2800}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step using algebra.

Let's denote the number of dumplings each female ate as 'f' and the number of dumplings each male ate as 'm'. We know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so we can write an equation:

m = f + 1

We are also given that each female ate 3 dumplings, so we can substitute f = 3 into the equation:

m = 3 + 1
m = 4

Now, let's find the total number of dumplings eaten by females and males. There are 6 females and 8 males, so the total number of people is 6 + 8 = 14. The total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6f = 6(3) = 18, and the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8m = 8(4) = 32.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten. We can write an equation:

6f + 8m = Total number of dumplings

Substituting the values of f and m, we get:

6(3) + 8(4) = Total number of dumplings
18 + 32 = Total number of dumplings
50 = Total number of dumplings

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to determine the amount they raise per hour. 

The amount raised in the first 3 hours is $2100. To find the amount raised per hour, we divide the total amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. The remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know that the city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. 

Next, we need to find the percentage of this 40% that is used for industrial purposes. Since 80% of the city's water usage is for industrial purposes, we can calculate this as 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 
40% - 32% = 8%.

Therefore, the correct answer is 8%."
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks and then multiply it by her daily charge.

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks will have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Now, we multiply the number of days by the daily charge: 
14 days * $12/day = $168

The final answer is: $168"
"Let's analyze the situation: an ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours and 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. We need to find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours.

Let's denote the production rate of chocolate ice cream as C and the production rate of vanilla ice cream as V. We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

C * 2 = 100 (equation 1)
V * 4 = 50 (equation 2)

We can solve for C and V by dividing both sides of each equation by the respective time:

C = 100 / 2 = 50 (quarts per hour)
V = 50 / 4 = 12.5 (quarts per hour)

Now, we can find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours by multiplying the production rates by the time:

Total chocolate ice cream = C * 48 = 50 * 48 = 2400
Total vanilla ice cream = V * 48 = 12.5 * 48 = 600

The total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours would be the sum of the total chocolate and vanilla ice cream:

Total quarts = 2400 + 600 = 3000

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:
- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches for $4.00 apiece: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Next, we need to apply the 10% discount to the total cost. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.10 (which is the decimal equivalent of 10%): $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin can buy, we need to consider the deal offered by the ice cream parlor. The deal states that for every 3 scoops purchased, Erin pays for 2 scoops, effectively making the cost of each ""set"" of 3 scoops $3.00.

Given Erin's budget of $6.00, we can divide it by the cost of each ""set"" of 3 scoops to find out how many sets she can afford.

$6.00 / $3.00 = 2 sets

Since each set contains 3 scoops, Erin can buy 2 sets, which is a total of 2 * 3 = 6 scoops.

However, Erin can also use her budget to buy individual scoops at the regular price of $1.50 each. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

Considering both options, Erin can either buy 2 sets of 3 scoops each (6 scoops) or buy 4 individual scoops. Since the deal is more cost-effective, Erin should buy 2 sets of 3 scoops each.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the difference in the amount of candy Amy and Ginger have after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in that time period and subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find the total number of mosaic tiles needed, we first need to calculate two thirds of the bathroom's area. This is done by multiplying 36 by 2 and then dividing the result by 3.

36 * 2 = 72
72 / 3 = 24

Now that we know the area to be covered is 24 sq ft, we can find the total number of tiles needed. Since each square foot requires 24 tiles, we multiply 24 by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The final answer is: 576"
"To calculate the cost of picking blueberries, we need to add the initial cost to the cost per pound multiplied by the number of pounds picked. The initial cost is $20, the cost per pound is $1.5, and the number of pounds picked is 30.

Cost of picking blueberries = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds)
= $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
= $20 + $45
= $65

To find the cost of buying blueberries at the store, we multiply the cost per pound by the number of pounds.

Cost of buying at the store = Cost per pound * Number of pounds
= $2.5 * 30
= $75

Now, we need to find the difference between the cost of buying at the store and the cost of picking blueberries.

Difference = Cost of buying at the store - Cost of picking blueberries
= $75 - $65
= $10

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of the original price and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 is 0.1 x 700 = $70.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers.

The total amount is 500 x $770 = $385,000.

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to break it down into its components.

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs: 6 eggs * 75 calories per egg = 450 calories.

Next, we'll calculate the calories from the cheese: 2 oz * 120 calories per oz = 240 calories.

Lastly, we'll calculate the calories from the ham: 2 oz * 40 calories per oz = 80 calories.

Now, let's add these values together: 450 + 240 = 690, and then 690 + 80 = 770.

The total calories in the omelet are 770."
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to multiply the cost of each item by the number of items purchased and then add the two amounts together.

"To calculate the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to consider the total damage it will cause to his car and the costs associated with fixing it.

The total damage to his car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole includes a fine for unauthorized road maintenance, which is $120, and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, which is 3 * $25 = $75.

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the total damage it will cause to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. First, let's find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we know that the remaining 2 friends ate Â¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we need to find the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people. We can do this by adding the number of slices eaten by the 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas and the 2 people who ate Â¾ of their pizzas:

Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Now, we can find the number of slices left by subtracting the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

Total number of slices = 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's re-examine the problem. We know that 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and 2 people ate Â¾ of their pizzas. We can calculate the total number of slices eaten by the 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

We can also calculate the total number of slices eaten by the 2 people who ate Â¾ of their pizzas:

2 people * 3/4 * 12 slices/person = 2 * 9 = 18 slices

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by all 5 people who ate 2/3 or Â¾ of their pizzas:

Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

However, we know that there are 7 people in total, and we need to account for the slices eaten by the remaining 2 people. Since the remaining 2 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 2 people as follows:

2 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 2 * 8 = 16 slices

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people:

Total number of slices eaten = 42 slices + 16 slices = 58 slices

Now, we can find the number of slices left by subtracting the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

Total number of slices = 7 people * 12 slices/person = 84 slices
Number of slices left = 84 slices - 58 slices = 26 slices

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and 2 people ate Â¾ of their pizzas. We can calculate the total number of slices eaten by the 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

We can also calculate the total number of slices eaten by the 2 people who ate Â¾ of their pizzas:

2 people * 3/4 * 12 slices/person = 2 * 9 = 18 slices

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by all 5 people who ate 2/3 or Â¾ of their pizzas:

Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

However, we know that there are 7 people in total, and we need to account for the slices eaten by the remaining 2 people. Since the remaining 2 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 2 people as follows:

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches, so 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches. 
Adding 4 inches to that gives us 96 + 4 = 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars:
- Number of students' cars: 64
- Number of windows per car: 4
- Fraction of windows smashed: 1/4
- Total windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) * (64 * 4) = (1/4) * 256 = 64

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars:
- Number of teachers' cars: 32
- Number of windows per car: 2
- Fraction of windows smashed: 3/4
- Total windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) * (32 * 2) = (3/4) * 64 = 48

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars:
Total windows smashed = 64 + 48 = 112

"To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to calculate the total number of blue spools and the total number of spools.

The total number of blue spools is the sum of light blue and dark blue spools: 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60.

The total number of spools is the sum of all the spools: 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150.

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the correct answer is 40%."
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, let's find the number of people who voted by midday. 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday.
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, let's find the number of people remaining after midday. 
5000 - 2000 = 3000 people remained.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.
5000 - 2000 = 3000 people voted by 16:00, but we need to subtract the people who voted by 16:00 from the people who remained after midday.
3000 - 2000 = 1000 people remained.

"Let's break down the problem into a system of linear equations to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

Let Dora's age be represented as D, her father's age as F, and her mother's age as M.

We are given the following information:
1. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age: F = 2D + 8
2. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father: M = F - 4
3. Dora is 15 years old: D = 15

We can substitute the value of D into the first equation to find F:
F = 2D + 8
F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Now that we have the value of F, we can find M:
M = F - 4
M = 38 - 4
M = 34

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
Total combined age = D + F + M
= 15 + 38 + 34

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as 'S'. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, Clara has 2S books. We are given that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation:

2S = 20

To find the value of S, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

S = 20 / 2
S = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we add 6 to the number of books Steven has:

Alice's books = S + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of books Clara and Alice have. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books, so the difference is:

Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"Let's analyze the given information:

We have a total of 50 students in the class. Out of these, 10 students like to bake, and 5 students like to play basketball. The remaining students like to either play video games or music. We are also given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball.

Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as 'v' and the number of students who like to play music as 'm'. We know that m = 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of students who like to either play video games or music is the sum of 'v' and 'm', which is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students who like to bake and the number of students who like to play basketball. This can be represented as:

v + m = 50 - (10 + 5)
v + 10 = 35

Now, we can solve for 'v':

v = 35 - 10
v = 25

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

"To determine the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by 8.

First, let's find the total number of chairs rented in a week. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekend days: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, we multiply the total chairs rented in a week by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month):
500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"Let's break down the sequence of events.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas, so the number of bananas left is 48 / 2 = 24.

Gunther added 25 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 24 + 25 = 49.

Arnold stole 12 bananas, so the number of bananas left is 49 - 12 = 37.

Gunther added 6 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 37 + 6 = 43.

The final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"

86"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine the number of small buttons Lorraine gets from trading her small stickers. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small buttons.

Next, we need to find out how many small buttons she has left after trading her small stickers. Since she traded 27 small stickers, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Now, let's calculate the number of large buttons she gets from trading her large stickers. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large buttons.

Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, we need to find out how many small buttons she gets from trading the remaining large stickers. She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small stickers, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, let's add up the total number of buttons she has. She has 3 small buttons from the remaining small stickers, 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers. 
However, since large buttons are worth three small buttons, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons. 
20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's add up the total number of small buttons. She has 3 small buttons from the remaining small stickers, 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers. 
3 + 27 + 60 = 90 small buttons.

Since large buttons are worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons. 
20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's add up the total number of buttons. She has 90 small buttons and 60 small buttons from large buttons. 
90 + 60 = 150 small buttons.

However, we need to convert the small buttons to the total number of buttons. 
Since each large button is worth three small buttons, we can divide the total number of small buttons by 3 to get the total number of buttons. 
150 / 3 = 50 large buttons.

The final answer is: 50"

The total number of matches Joey played in one week is 7."
"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

"To find the total number of shirts ordered, we need to determine the number of students for each size. 

First, we know that 11 students need size extra-small. 

Next, we are told that twice as many students need size small as extra small. So, 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.

Then, we are informed that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.

After that, we find that half as many students need size large as size medium. This means 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.

Finally, we are told that six more students need size extra-large than large. So, 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add the number of students for each size together: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 
So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 40 - 24 = 16 people.

"Let's dive into the problem. We're given that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and we know there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up a proportion:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's set up a proportion to find the total number of puppies:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for the three houses is 250. We also know that the first house needs 1/2 of the second, and the third house needs double the first.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles, and the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

Since the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250, we can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases of shingles, we can find the number of cases the third house needs. Since the third house needs double the first, and the first house needs x/2 = 100/2 = 50 cases of shingles, the third house needs 2 * 50 = 100 cases of shingles.

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to consider her hourly wage and the conditional bonus for teaching more than 3 classes.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not earn an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Bennet wants to make a total of $135 from selling his eggplants and corn. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, we need to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for. Let's denote the price of each ear of corn as 'x'. Since he has 25 ears of corn, the total amount he makes from selling the corn is 25x.

We know that the total amount he wants to make is $135, and he already makes $60 from eggplants. So, the amount he needs to make from corn is $135 - $60 = $75.

Now, we can set up a linear equation to represent the situation:

25x = 75

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 25:

x = 75 / 25
x = 3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Since he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, we can calculate this by multiplying 50 (the total number of pencils) by 1/2.
   50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.

2. Now, we need to find out how many pencils Anthony has left after giving 25 to Brandon. We subtract the number of pencils given to Brandon from the total number of pencils.
   50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

3. Next, we need to find out how many pencils Anthony gave to Charlie. Since he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, we can calculate this by multiplying 25 (the remaining number of pencils) by 3/5.
   25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.

4. Finally, we need to find out how many pencils Anthony has left after giving 15 to Charlie. We subtract the number of pencils given to Charlie from the remaining number of pencils.
   25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's find the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum and back. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and his speed is 75 mph. Since he drives the same distance back home, we can calculate the total driving time as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives to the museum and back, we multiply the time by 2 to get the total driving time:
Total driving time = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, let's add the time Jack spends at the museum to the total driving time:
Total time Jack is gone from home = Total driving time + Time at the museum
Total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours

"To calculate the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break down the costs into three categories: movies in series, older movies, and normal movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, which can be calculated as 600 * (1/3) = 200 movies.

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is 200 * $6 = $1200.

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies: 600 - 200 = 400 movies.

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which can be calculated as 400 * 0.4 = 160 movies.

The cost of the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies: 400 - 160 = 240 normal movies.

The cost of the normal movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost: $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

"To find the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

Let's denote the driving speed as D and the hiking speed as H. We know that H = D - 5, since they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of D is D/2, so H = D/2 - 5.

We also know that they drove for 6 hours at D miles per hour and hiked for 1.5 hours at H miles per hour. The distance they drove is 6D and the distance they hiked is 1.5H.

We can set up the equation for the total time they spent traveling: 6 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

We can also set up the equation for the total distance they traveled: 6D + 1.5H = total distance.

Since H = D/2 - 5, we can substitute this into the equation for the total distance: 6D + 1.5(D/2 - 5) = total distance.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 6D + 0.75D - 7.5 = total distance.

Combine like terms: 6.75D - 7.5 = total distance.

We know that the total time is 7.5 hours, so we can set up the equation: 6.75D - 7.5 = total distance.

However, we need to find the total distance. We can use the fact that the total time is 7.5 hours to find the total distance. Since distance = speed * time, we can set up the equation: total distance = 7.5 * (D + H).

Substituting H = D/2 - 5, we get: total distance = 7.5 * (D + D/2 - 5).

Simplifying the equation, we get: total distance = 7.5 * (1.5D - 5).

Now we have two equations: 6.75D - 7.5 = total distance and total distance = 7.5 * (1.5D - 5).

We can set these two equations equal to each other: 6.75D - 7.5 = 7.5 * (1.5D - 5).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 6.75D - 7.5 = 11.25D - 37.5.

Subtract 6.75D from both sides: -7.5 = 4.5D - 37.5.

Add 37.5 to both sides: 30 = 4.5D.

Divide both sides by 4.5: D = 6.67.

Now that we have the driving speed, we can find the hiking speed: H = D/2 - 5 = 6.67/2 - 5 = 3.335 - 5 = -1.665. However, speed cannot be negative, so this is an error in the previous steps.

Let's re-evaluate the steps. We know that the total time is 7.5 hours, so we can set up the equation: 6 + 1.5 = 7.5.

We also know that the total distance is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked: total distance = 6D + 1.5H.

Since H = D/2 - 5, we can substitute this into the equation for the total distance: total distance = 6D + 1.5(D/2 - 5).

Simplifying the equation, we get: total distance = 6D + 0.75D - 7.5.

Combine like terms: 6.75D - 7.5 = total distance.

However, we need to find the total distance. We can use the fact that the total time is 7.5 hours to find the total distance. Since distance = speed * time, we can set up the equation: total distance = 7.5 * (D + H).

We can set these two equations equal to each other: 6.75D - 7.5 = 7.5 * (1.5D - 5).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 6.75D - 7.5 = 11.25D - 37.5.

Subtract 6.75D from both sides: -7.5 = 4.5D - 37.5.

Add 37.5 to both sides: 30 = 4.5D.

Divide both sides by 4.5: D = 6.67.

Subtract 6.75D from both sides: -7.5 = 4.5D - 37.5.

Add 37.5 to both sides: 30 = 4.5D.

Divide both sides by 4.5: D = 6.67.

Simplifying the equation, we get: total distance = 7.5 * (1.5D - 5).

Now we have two equations: 6.75D - 7.5 = total distance and total distance = 7.5 * (1.5D - 5).

We can set these two equations equal to each other: 6.75D - 7.5 = 7.5 * (1.5D - 5).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 6.75D - 7.5 = 11.25D - 37.5.

Subtract 6.75D from both sides: -7.5 = 4.5D - 37.5.

Add 37.5 to both sides: 30 = 4.5D.

We also know that the total distance is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked: total distance = 6D + 1.5H.

Since H = D/2 - 5, we can substitute this into the equation for the total distance: total distance = 6D + 1.5(D/2 - 5).

Simplifying the equation, we get: total distance = 6D + 0.75D - 7.5.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote Emma's score as E, Ava's enemy score as A_e, Ava's berry score as A_b, and Ava's timer score as A_t.

We know that A_e = E + 8 (Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma)
A_b = E + 3 (Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma)
A_t = 60 - (E + 4) (Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma)

We also know that the total score for each player is the sum of their enemy score, berry score, and timer score.

E = E + 0 (Emma doesn't jump on any extra enemies or collect any extra berries)
E = E + 0 + 0 (Emma finishes the level in the same time as the timer is 60 seconds)

Ava's total score is A_e + A_b + A_t = (E + 8) + (E + 3) + (60 - (E + 4)) = 2E + 7

The difference in their scores is A - E = (2E + 7) - E = E + 7

However, we still need to find the value of E to calculate the difference.

Since we don't have any information about the value of E, we can use the fact that the difference in their scores is the sum of the differences in their enemy scores, berry scores, and timer scores.

The difference in their enemy scores is 8.
The difference in their berry scores is 3.
The difference in their timer scores is (60 - (E + 4)) - 60 = -4.

The difference in their scores is 8 + 3 - 4 = 7.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days: 15 + 12 = 27.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O.

We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so we can write the equation: W + O = 17.

We also know that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Initially, he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying W white fish and O orange fish, he had 3 + O orange fish and 4 + W white fish. Therefore, we can write the equation: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) W + O = 17
2) 3 + O = 2(4 + W)

We can solve the second equation for O: O = 2(4 + W) - 3 = 8 + 2W - 3 = 5 + 2W.

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the first equation: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combine like terms: 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

"To determine the weekly fuel consumption and cost of Andy's car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in a week and then apply the car's fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

The distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles, and he travels this distance twice a day (to and from work), so the total daily distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost per week: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The weekly fuel consumption and cost of Andy's car is $15."
"To calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to find the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent.

First, let's calculate the value of the quarters. Since there are 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 140 by $0.25 to get the total value of the quarters: 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, we need to find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3 and then divide by 5: (10 * 3) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6. So, she spent 6 twenties.

Since each twenty is worth $20, the total value of the twenties she spent is 6 * $20 = $120.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties to find the total amount of money she spent: $35 + $120 = $155.

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to find the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point.

The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder, so it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

The temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we need to find the total number of groups formed. Since 90 people are to be divided into groups of 9, we use division to find the number of groups:
Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we need to find the number of groups that brought back seashells. Since 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by the fraction:
Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells. Since each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells, we multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by the number of seashells per group:
Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the target hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and she plays for half an hour every day. So, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in 1 week. There are 7 days in 1 week, and she plays for 2 hours every day. So, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Now, we add the hours Kris played in 2 weeks and 1 week: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"When two objects move in the same direction, the relative speed between them is the difference of their speeds. In this case, the first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour.

The relative speed between the two cars is:
70 miles/hour - 60 miles/hour = 10 miles/hour

Since the relative speed is 10 miles per hour, the distance between the two cars will increase by 10 miles every hour. After 2 hours, the distance between them will be:
10 miles/hour * 2 hours = 20 miles

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the 30% premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Adding these together gives us $600 + $300 = $900.

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium. To do this, we multiply the total cost of the diamond and gold ($900) by 0.3, which is the decimal equivalent of 30%. This gives us 0.3 * $900 = $270.

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold: $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders, and the pass rate of fourth-graders is 40/100, the pass rate of fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:

"To determine the length of the mosaic, we first need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with the glass chips he has. Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many chips he has in total.

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with 144 chips. 

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it can be. We know that the area of a rectangle (such as the mosaic) is length * width. Since we know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), we can find the length.

Area = length * width
12 = length * 3
length = 12 / 3
length = 4

"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students and then add it to the amount of tea left.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea drank and left is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to convert quarts to gallons. There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so we divide 48 by 4 to get the total amount of tea in gallons.

48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially had 100 candies. Then, he sold 150 candies. To find out how many candies he has left, we subtract the number of candies sold from the initial number of candies: 100 - 150 = -50. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. 

This means that Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold. He then ordered 100 more candies. So, we add the initial number of candies to the additional number of candies: 100 + 100 = 200.

Now, we need to find out how many candies he still needs to sell. To do this, we subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies: 200 - 150 = 50.

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch.

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 = 39, 39 + 20 = 59, 59 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

"To determine the number of marshmallows left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Marshmallows used by John = 9
Marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Now, to find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 (since there are 2 kids).

Total marshmallows left = 14
Number of kids = 2
S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time played by each person and then multiply it by the cost per minute.

First, let's find the total time played by each person. Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Two of his friends play for half the time, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. The friend who is better than Jack plays for 1.5 times the time, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

Now, we multiply the total time played by the cost per minute: 840 * 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x, the amount of salt (and sugar) as y, and the amount of oil as z.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. x + x + y + y + z = 10 (the total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces)
2. z = 2y (the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt)
3. y = 2x (the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest)

We can simplify equation 1 to 2x + 2y + z = 10.

Substitute equation 3 into equation 2: z = 2(2x) = 4x.

Now we have the system of linear equations:
1. 2x + 2y + 4x = 10
2. y = 2x

We can simplify equation 1 to 6x + 2y = 10.

Substitute equation 2 into equation 1: 6x + 2(2x) = 10.

Combine like terms: 6x + 4x = 10.

Combine like terms: 10x = 10.

Divide both sides by 10: x = 1.

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y: y = 2x = 2(1) = 2.

Finally, we can find the value of z: z = 4x = 4(1) = 4.

The amount of oil is 4 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the cows: 2 cows * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine the number of cupcakes Paul should buy, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of cupcakes he needs and the number of cupcakes he already has.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 48 cupcakes.

To find the number of cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:

63 (total needed) - 48 (already have) = 15

Therefore, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which gives us 8 cars sold.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

So, Joe gives away a total of 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to determine the number of cars present in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the total number of tasks John completes in a day. Since he does 30 cycles of work a day and each cycle has 5 tasks, we multiply the number of cycles by the number of tasks per cycle.

Number of cycles per day: 30
Number of tasks per cycle: 5
Total tasks per day = 30 * 5
Total tasks per day = 150

Next, we calculate John's daily earnings by multiplying the total tasks per day by the pay per task, which is $1.20.

Daily earnings = Total tasks per day * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 150 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Now, to find John's weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 7.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to determine her points in both games and add them together.

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. 
In the same game, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

Now, let's find Sasha's points in the second game. Since Sasha struggles during away games, we know she scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. Julie scored 10 points in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add Sasha's points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

First, let's determine the number of blue eggs. Since Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, and she had 5 green eggs, the number of blue eggs is 2 * 5 = 10.

Next, we need to find the number of pink eggs. Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so the number of pink eggs is 10 - 1 = 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of yellow eggs. Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so the number of yellow eggs is 9 / 3 = 3.

Finally, we add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the total amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping:
- Cost per pound: $0.35
- Weight of the book: 4 pounds
- Cost per mile: $0.08
- Distance: 20 miles
- Total cost of shipping: (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20) = 1.4 + 1.6 = $2.99

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount:
- Purchase price: $32
- Refund percentage: 75%
- Refund amount: 0.75 * 32 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
- Total cost of shipping: $2.99
- Refund amount: $24
- Total loss: 2.99 + (32 - 24) = 2.99 + 8 = $10.99

The final answer is: $10.99"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the total amount of money she had initially.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had initially. Her father gave her $100, and she already had $40, so she now has $100 + $40 = $140.

Next, we need to find out how much money she spent. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 * $30 = $60. She also buys a bag for $20. The total amount of money she spent is $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount of money she spent from the total amount of money she had initially: $140 - $80 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on writing songs per week: 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

Next, we'll calculate the time Britany spends on makeup per week: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time Britany spends on recording videos per week: 18 videos * 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes.

Now, we'll add up the time Britany spends on TikTok per week: 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes.

To convert the total weekly time to hours, we'll divide by 60: 282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours.

Finally, we'll calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month: 4.7 hours * 4 weeks = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the installation into its components. The base price for the installation is $129.00, which includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.

Angela has additional items to be installed: 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. We need to calculate the cost of these additional items.

For the mirrors, the base price includes 4, so we need to install 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors. The cost for these additional mirrors is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

For the chandeliers, the base price includes 1, so we need to install 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier. The cost for this additional chandelier is 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

For the pictures, the base price includes 10, so we need to install 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures. The cost for these additional pictures is 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, we add the cost of the additional items to the base price: $129.00 (base price) + $30.00 (additional mirrors) + $15.00 (additional chandelier) + $150.00 (additional pictures) = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To find the amount of money Roy has saved, we need to understand the relationships between the savings of Roy, Anthony, and Eva.

Eva has saved $20.00. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.

To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to establish a series of ratios based on the given information.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, let's add these two distances together: 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take a total of 18 hours to cross a highway. 

First, we need to find the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since there are three kangaroos, we divide the total time by 3 to get the time for one kangaroo: 18 hours / 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. To find the time it takes for the turtles to travel across the highway, we need to multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2, since the turtles are moving at half the speed. However, we have four turtles, so we need to multiply the time by 2 and then by 4/2 to account for the number of turtles. 

So, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is 6 hours * 2 * 2 = 24 hours.

However, this is incorrect. The correct calculation should be 6 hours * 2 = 12 hours, then multiply by 4/2 which is 2, so 12 * 2 = 24 hours is incorrect.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of clay dishes each person made. Let's denote the number of dishes Kora made as x. Since Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, the number of dishes Rory made is x + 20. Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so the number of dishes Jada made is 2(x + 20).

We are given that Kora made 20 dishes. Therefore, x = 20. We can substitute this value into the expressions for Rory and Jada's dishes:

Rory's dishes: x + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
Jada's dishes: 2(x + 20) = 2(20 + 20) = 2(40) = 80

Now, we can find the total number of dishes by adding the number of dishes each person made:
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's help.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 and her mom gave her $80, so the total amount of money she received is: 
$150 + $80 = $230

Now, we know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs: 
$400 + $50 = $450

Since Erika received $230, the amount of money she had in her purse initially is: 
$450 - $230 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of apple slices, we need to calculate the number of slices from the large and small apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of slices from the large apples: 3 x 5 = 15 slices.
Next, we calculate the number of slices from the small apples: 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples together: 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

"To determine the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out the total number of cows required to achieve this production rate. 

The milk production rate per cow is 5 liters per day. To find the total number of cows needed, we divide the desired milk production (25 liters) by the milk production rate per cow (5 liters).

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to have 5 cows in total.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/6, which is the same as dividing 12 by 6. 
12 / 6 = 2 millimeters

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 2/3, which is the same as multiplying 12 by 2 and then dividing by 3. 
(12 * 2) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8 millimeters

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/2, which is the same as dividing 12 by 2. 
12 / 2 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions together: 
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080.

Gabriel has $5000 from working and $200 from his brother, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items:
$10080 - $5200 = $4880

The amount of money Gabriel still needs is $4880."
"To find the change, we need to calculate the total amount Thea gave the craftsman and then subtract the cost of the hat.

First, let's calculate the total amount Thea gave the craftsman by multiplying the number of $20 bills by the value of each bill: 4 * $20 = $80

Now, let's subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount: $80 - $70 = $10

Thea got $10 as change."
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's analyze the given information:

Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can set up the equation:
Dishes = 2 * Socks
60 = 2 * Socks
Socks = 60 / 2
Socks = 30

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so we can set up the equation:
Peter's Socks = 2 * Jack's Socks
Peter's Socks = 2 * 30
Peter's Socks = 60

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so we can set up the equation:
Peter's Dishes = 0.5 * Jack's Dishes
Peter's Dishes = 0.5 * 60
Peter's Dishes = 30

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total Socks = Jack's Socks + Peter's Socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total Dishes = Jack's Dishes + Peter's Dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes together is 180."
"To find the total number of students good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of students good at math only as M, the number of students good at English only as E, and the number of students good at both as B.

We are given:
- T = 20
- M = 5
- E = 8

We can find the number of students good at both math and English by subtracting the sum of students good at math only and English only from the total number of students:
B = T - (M + E)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the students good at math only and those good at both:
Total students good at math = M + B
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time for each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes to perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to understand that the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. This means the interest rate is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

The interest earned each year is a fixed amount, so we can simply add it to the previous total each year. 

Year 1: $300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525
Year 2: $525 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $750
Year 3: $750 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $975

Therefore, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975.

The final answer is: $975"
"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we first need to determine the number of white shirts with collars. Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20.

The number of white shirts with no collars is then 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. Given that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. This difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find the number of goats left in Farm X, we need to subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm X. 
Number of goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45

To find the number of goats sold from Farm Y, we multiply the number of goats sold from Farm X by 2. 
Number of goats sold from Farm Y = 10 * 2 = 20

To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm Y.
Number of goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y.
Total number of goats left = 45 + 25 = 70

"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms and we want to clean one-half of them, we can represent this as a fraction: 90/2.

To simplify this fraction, we divide the numerator by the denominator: 90 Ã· 2 = 45 rooms.

Now, we need to find the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room: 45 * 20 = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 900 Ã· 60 = 15 hours.

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 = 48, then 48 + 96 = 144.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote my age as 'x', my brother's age as 'x + 3', my sister's age as 'x - 2', and my mom's age as '3(x + 3) - 1'.

We know that the sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. Let's try to find a whole number solution.

We can rewrite the equation as: 8x = 70.

Since 8x is a multiple of 8, we can try to find a whole number solution by dividing 70 by 8. However, 70 is not a multiple of 8, so we need to find a different approach.

Let's try to find a whole number solution by testing different values of x. We can start by trying x = 8.

If x = 8, then my brother's age is x + 3 = 11, my sister's age is x - 2 = 6, and my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 23.

"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for his students.

Total number of students: 27
Number of glue sticks per student: 2
Total number of glue sticks required: 27 * 2 = 54

Now, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are needed. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.

Number of glue sticks per pack: 8
Number of packs required: 54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. To do this, we can use the ceiling function or simply round up by adding 1 to the decimal part of the result. In this case, the decimal part is 0.75, so we add 1 to get 1.75, and then add that to the whole number part, which is 6. This gives us 7.75, but since we are rounding up to the nearest whole number, we take the whole number part, which is 7.

"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to calculate the amount of water on the first day, the second day, and the third day, and then add them together.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Now, let's add the amounts of water from each day together: 4000 + 8000 = 12000, and 12000 + 14000 = 26000.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 26000 gallons.

The final answer is: 26000"
"To model the growth of the plague, we can use a discrete time step approach. Let's denote the initial number of infected people as I0 = 10 and the number of people each infected person infects as r = 6.

The number of people infected after one day is I1 = I0 + (I0 * r) = 10 + (10 * 6) = 70.

The number of people infected after two days is I2 = I1 + (I1 * r) = 70 + (70 * 6) = 70 + 420 = 490.

The number of people infected after three days is I3 = I2 + (I2 * r) = 490 + (490 * 6) = 490 + 2940 = 3430.

However, we can simplify this process by using a formula for exponential growth in discrete time steps: In = I0 * (1 + r)^n, where n is the number of time steps.

Using this formula, we can calculate the number of people infected after three days as I3 = 10 * (1 + 6)^3 = 10 * 7^3 = 10 * 343 = 3430.

The final answer is: 3430"
"To find the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips, we first need to calculate the amount each of them received.

Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, each giving $20. So, Rafaela's total tips are 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.1, which equals $80. 

Now, we subtract $80 from Rafaela's total tips to find Julieta's total tips: $800 - $80 = $720.

The total amount of money they received as tips is the sum of their individual tips: $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. 
She gave her only boy 3 oranges. 
So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges: 
12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratios of badges earned by Claire, Amber, and Wendy. 

Let's denote the time it takes Claire to earn a badge as 'x'. Since Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, the time it takes Amber to earn a badge is 2x. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so the time it takes Wendy to earn a badge is x/3.

The number of badges earned by each person in a year (12 months) can be calculated as follows:
- Claire: 12/x
- Amber: 12/(2x) = 6/x
- Wendy: 12/(x/3) = 36/x

Since we are comparing the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a year, we can simplify the ratios by canceling out the common factor 'x'. However, we don't know the value of 'x', but we can still compare the ratios of badges earned by Wendy and Amber.

The ratio of badges earned by Wendy to Amber is 36/x : 6/x, which simplifies to 6:1.

To find the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber, we can multiply the ratio by 12 (the number of months in a year) and subtract the smaller number from the larger number:
6 * 12 = 72
1 * 12 = 12
72 - 12 = 60

However, this is the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Claire, not Amber. To find the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber, we need to subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy. Since we know that Wendy earns 6 times as many badges as Amber in a year, we can find the number of badges earned by Amber by dividing the number of badges earned by Wendy by 6.

36 badges (Wendy) / 6 = 6 badges (Amber)

Now, we can find the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To calculate the total amount raised, we need to determine the total number of slices Paige baked and sold, and then multiply that by the price per slice.

She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a 5-hour interval. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is equivalent to $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice:

80 * 0.50 = 40

However, since we are dealing with dollars, we can also multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice in dollars:

80 * 0.50 = 40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to find the number of silver coins first. 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30 and G = 70.

Since G = S + 30 and G = 70, we can set up the equation S + 30 = 70.

To find S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

S + 30 - 30 = 70 - 30
S = 40

Now that we know S = 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = S + G
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George.

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. To find the total number of burritos eaten by the students, we multiply the number of students by the number of burritos each student received: 50 * 10 = 500.

Next, we need to add the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George, which is 20. So, the total number of burritos eaten is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Now, we need to find the total number of leftover burritos. To do this, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the initial number of burritos: 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red cars as R, the number of green cars as G, the number of blue cars as B, and the number of yellow cars as Y.

We are given the following information:

1. The rink has 12 red cars: R = 12
2. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars: G = R - 2
3. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars: B = 3G
4. The rink has a total of 75 cars: R + G + B + Y = 75

Substituting the given values into the equations, we get:

1. R = 12
2. G = 12 - 2 = 10
3. B = 3 * 10 = 30
4. 12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75

Now, we can solve for Y by simplifying equation 4:

12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75
52 + Y = 75

Subtracting 52 from both sides gives us:

Y = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to create a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
We also know that A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can express S in terms of F by substituting the second equation into the first: S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

We also know that S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

Now we have a system of two equations with three variables. To solve for F, we can substitute the expression for S into the third equation: (F + 13) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms: 2F + A + 13 = 85

Subtract 13 from both sides: 2F + A = 72

Now we have the equation 2F + A = 72. We can substitute the expression for A from the second equation into this equation: 2F + (F - 12) = 72
Combine like terms: 3F - 12 = 72

Add 12 to both sides: 3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we first need to determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we multiply 5 by 2 to find the weight of the sweet potatoes.

5 * 2 = 10

Now that we know the sweet potatoes weigh 10 pounds, we can find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so we subtract 3 from 10.

10 - 3 = 7

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

Next, he ate 10 pieces on the second day.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to determine the cost of each item first.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so we can find the cost of 1 bottle of soda by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles: $21.00 Ã· 7 = $3.00 per bottle of soda.

Similarly, the cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so we can find the cost of 1 bottle of water by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles: $8.00 Ã· 4 = $2.00 per bottle of water.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the cost of each item by the number of items: 
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Now, we know he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each. To find the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000. This means the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, we can find the cost price by subtracting the profit from the selling price:

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

"To find out when Melanie's age will be thrice her present age, we need to set up an equation based on her current age and the future age that is three times her current age.

Let's denote the number of years it takes for her age to be thrice her present age as 'x'. At that time, her age will be her current age plus 'x', and it will be thrice her current age.

Melanie's current age is 8 years old. Therefore, her age in 'x' years will be 8 + x. Since this age will be thrice her current age, we can set up the equation:

8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 24 - 8
x = 16

Therefore, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

"Given the problem, we have a system of proportional relationships between the speeds of a whirligig, a thingamabob, and a whatchamacallit. We know that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x, and the speed of the whirligig is 5 times the speed of the thingamabob, which is 5x.

We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig:

Speed of whirligig = 5x
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 
Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6 for Joe's lawn, $18x for Kamala's lawn, and $30x for Alba's lawn. So, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6 + 18x + 30x = 48x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. Let's denote the amount she made from lemonade sales as 'y'. We can set up the equation: 48x + y = 80.

We also know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80, and she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. Since she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 48x + y = 80 to find y.

48(1) + y = 80
48 + y = 80
y = 80 - 48
y = 32

However, we can also set up the equation 6 + 18x + 30x + y = 80 to represent the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns. Since we know that 6 + 18x + 30x = 48x, we can rewrite the equation as 48x + y = 80.

We can also set up the equation 6 + y = 80 - 48x to represent the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns. Since we know that 6 + 18x + 30x = 48x, we can rewrite the equation as 6 + y = 80 - 48x.

We can solve the equation 6 + y = 80 - 48x for y: 
y = 80 - 48x - 6
y = 74 - 48x

Now we have two equations: 
48x + y = 80
y = 74 - 48x

We can substitute y = 74 - 48x into the equation 48x + y = 80:
48x + (74 - 48x) = 80
48x + 74 - 48x = 80
74 = 80

This is a contradiction, which means that the system of equations has no solution. However, we can also try to solve the system of equations by substituting x = 1 into the equation y = 74 - 48x:
y = 74 - 48(1)
y = 74 - 48
y = 26

The final answer is: $26"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow a step-by-step process.

First, we know Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Next, we calculate Carl's weight by adding 16 kg to Martin's weight: 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Then, we find Christian's weight by adding 8 kg to Carl's weight: 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Finally, we determine Harry's weight by subtracting 5 kg from Christian's weight: 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find the total amount John earns from renting his car, we need to multiply the number of times he rents it by the number of hours and his hourly rate.

Number of times rented: 10
Number of hours per rental: 3
Hourly rate: $25

Total earnings = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, we need to subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's analyze the given information:

Martha initially had an unknown number of notebooks, which we can represent as 'x'. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

We are also given that Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7 notebooks. This can be represented as the equation: x + 5 = 7.

To find the value of 'x', we need to solve the equation x + 5 = 7. Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation gives us x = 2.

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we need to subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to calculate the distance rowed by Anis. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can find this by multiplying Dijana's distance by 1/5 and then adding it to Dijana's distance.

Dijana's distance is 50 miles. 1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, we add Dijana's and Anis's distances to find the total distance rowed: 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies left after Susan's husband took some. 

There were initially 100 cookies, and 4 were taken by Susan's husband. So, we subtract 4 from 100 to find the remaining cookies: 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

To do this, we perform the division: 96 Ã· 6 = 16.

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday, which is 5 + 13 = 18 pages. 
Daniel did not read any pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.
Daniel's total pages read = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to establish the ratio of adult to child bowls. Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, we can say that 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls.

Given that there are 4 adults and 2 children, a total of 6 people will eat dinner. Since each adult eats 1 bowl, the total number of bowls used for dinner is 4 (adult bowls). 

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total number of child bowls used for dinner is 4 * 2 = 8. 

The total number of child bowls available is 8, and 8 child bowls were used for dinner. Therefore, 0 child bowls are left over.

However, since we are looking for the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to consider the leftover soup in terms of child bowls. Since 0 child bowls are left over, we can say that each child can have 0 bowls of soup for lunch.

However, since the question asks for the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup, we can say that each child can have 0 times a bowl of soup for lunch, but this is not a meaningful answer in this context. A more meaningful answer would be the number of times the child can have a bowl of soup for lunch if the leftover soup is divided among the children.

"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen, then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is calculated by multiplying 5 by $1.50, which equals $7.50.
The cost of 1 ballpen at $0.5 is simply $0.5.

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together: $7.50 + $0.5 = $8.

"Let's break down the problem into two separate ratios to find out how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

We have two ratios:

1. 4 small masks to 2 yards of material
2. 3 large masks to 2.25 yards of material

We can set up two equations based on these ratios:

Let x be the amount of material needed for 20 small masks and y be the amount of material needed for 8 large masks.

From the first ratio, we get: 4/2 = 20/x, which simplifies to 2 = 20/x, and solving for x gives us x = 10 yards.

From the second ratio, we get: 3/2.25 = 8/y, which simplifies to 4/3 = 8/y, and solving for y gives us y = 3 yards.

However, we need to find the total amount of material needed, which is the sum of the material needed for small and large masks. We already know that x = 10 yards and y = 3 yards, but we need to find the total material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

To find the total material needed for 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 small mask by 20: 0.5 * 20 = 10 yards.

To find the total material needed for 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 large mask by 8: 0.75 * 8 = 6 yards.

The total material needed is the sum of the material needed for small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to divide the total amount she spent by the total number of tickets she bought.

First, let's calculate the total number of tickets. Since Deepa saw each of the 9 movies three times, we multiply the number of movies by the number of times she saw each movie: 9 * 3 = 27 tickets.

Now, we divide the total amount she spent, $216, by the total number of tickets, 27.

Average price per ticket = $216 / 27

"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works for 8 hours (since he works 2 hours less than he sleeps), and walks his dog for 1 hour.

Total hours spent = 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walk) = 19 hours

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total hours spent
Free time = 24 - 19
Free time = 5 hours

"To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we need to determine the initial number of books he had. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, we multiply 9 by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

This means Joseph initially had 18 books. However, he lost 2 of them. To find the current number of books Joseph has, we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books.

18 - 2 = 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: (Duncan's age eight years ago) = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)
So, (Duncan's current age - 8) = 2 * (Adam's current age - 4)
Since Duncan's age is 60 now, we can substitute 60 for Duncan's current age in the equation:
(60 - 8) = 2 * (Adam's current age - 4)
52 = 2 * (Adam's current age - 4)
52 = 2 * Adam's current age - 8
52 + 8 = 2 * Adam's current age
60 = 2 * Adam's current age
Adam's current age = 60 / 2
Adam's current age = 30
To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time interval at which he drinks a bottle.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so it takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, we need to divide the total time by 30 to find out how many bottles he drinks.

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of red balloons as r and the number of yellow balloons as y.

We know that the total number of balloons is the sum of red and yellow balloons, so we can write the equation: r + y = total number of balloons. However, we are not given the total number of balloons directly, but we are given that 20 of the balloons are red. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as r = 20.

We also know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58. We can write the equation: 2r + 3y = 58.

Substituting r = 20 into the second equation, we get: 2(20) + 3y = 58.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 40 + 3y = 58.

Subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation, we get: 3y = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: y = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car needs, we must first calculate the total miles driven in 30 days. This can be achieved by multiplying the daily miles driven by the number of days.

Total miles driven = 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we need to find out how many 1000-mile intervals are contained within 3000 miles. This can be done by dividing the total miles driven by 1000.

Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Therefore, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) = 8
8 + 6 (oranges) = 14

"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing each sport and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of students playing volleyball. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis, and there are 6 students playing tennis, we multiply 6 by 2 to get 12 students playing volleyball.

Next, we need to find the total number of students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so we add these two numbers together to get 38 students playing soccer.

Now, let's add the number of students playing each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To determine the profit made from selling lollipops, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each, and there are 30 students. 

Total revenue = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 30 * 10 * $0.8
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Next, we calculate the total cost. The lollipops were bought for $0.5 each.

Total cost = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 30 * 10 * $0.5
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Now, we can find the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $240 - $150
Total profit = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats.

Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, we can calculate the number of dogs by multiplying the number of cats by 3: 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, we find the number of rabbits by subtracting 2 from the number of dogs: 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Now, we calculate the number of fish by multiplying the number of rabbits by 3: 7 * 3 = 21 fish.

Then, we determine the number of gerbils by dividing the number of fish by 3: 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To determine how long a loaf of bread will last when shared between Abby and Josh, we need to calculate their combined daily consumption.

Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Their combined daily consumption is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 24-slice loaf of bread will last when they eat 6 slices per day. To do this, we divide the total number of slices by their daily consumption: 24 / 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. 

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old, and by her 10th birthday, she has been collecting for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months/year.

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows. 

So, the number of cups in each row is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 / 2. 

When dividing 9 by 2, we get a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 1. This means that 9 is not exactly divisible by 2, but we can still divide 9 into two parts: 4 and 5. 

However, since the total number of mint tea cups is 15, and 3 rows of 4 mint tea cups would be 12, we can conclude that there are 5 mint tea cups in each row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours. Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Now, we need to find out how many berries he needs to collect per trip to reach a total of 24 berries in 2 trips. To do this, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips: 24 / 2 = 12 berries per trip.

Therefore, the sloth can pick up 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, and there are 10000 gallons of water in the pool, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Next, we need to find the total amount of water used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the total amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

Finally, to find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left.

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday.

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version. So, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Now, let's find the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, let's find the calories of a mini blueberry muffin. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version. So, a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's find the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins. Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, which is 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed: 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378.

There are 5 days in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days: 378 / 5 = 75.6.

The average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 75.6."
"To determine the distance each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus, traveling at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, covered a distance of 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car, traveling at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, covered a distance of 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

"To solve the problem, we can start by expressing Paul's age in terms of John's age using the given information that Paul is 10 years older than John. Let's denote John's age as J. Then, Paul's age is J + 10.

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age. Let's denote Peter's age as P. Then, we have the equation P = (J + 10) + J.

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old. This gives us the equation P + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Now, we can substitute P with (J + 10) + J in the equation P + (J + 10) + J = 100:
(J + 10) + J + J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
3J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
3J = 80
Divide both sides by 3:
J = 80/3
J = 26.67

Now that we have John's age, we can find Paul's age:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 26.67 + 10
Pp = 36.67

Now that we have Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = Pp + J
P = 36.67 + 26.67
P = 63.34

The final answer is: 63.34"
"To find the total number of water balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the number of tables needed, we first calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available. 

There are 10 people donating 5 boxes each, resulting in 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
Adding the 10 boxes they already have, the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, the number of tables required is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, they already own 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they have from the total required: 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 more tables for the yard sale."
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide by the number of seeds.

Zoey's total distance is calculated by multiplying the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney's total distance is calculated by multiplying the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

The total distance spat is the sum of Zoey's and Sydney's total distances: 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is the sum of the seeds spat by Zoey and Sydney: 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

Now, to find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

"To determine the difference in earnings between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by each machine over a 30-day period.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and operates 24 hours a day. Over 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and operates 24 hours a day. Over 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day
1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine, assuming each widget sells for $6:
Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in revenue:
$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The Widgeteer 3000 will generate $64,800 more in revenue than the WidgetMaster 9000 over a 30-day period.

"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we need to calculate the cost of the 24-hour option and the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours. 

The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos. 

The 12-hour option costs 1000 pesos, and Cameron needs to add 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark. Since he stays for 17 hours, he needs to add 70 * 5 = 350 pesos for the additional 5 hours.

So, the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat requires 5 pounds of hay, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs.

Twice the amount each goat needs is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. First, we need to find the distance James swims before resting. Since he swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, we can calculate this distance as follows:

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Now, we can find the time it took James to swim this distance. His swimming speed is 2 miles per hour, so:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

"Let's analyze the given information: Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. This means Marcus's age can be represented as 26 - 5 = 21.

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship. Let L be Leo's age. The equation would be:

L / 2 = 21

To solve for L, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

L = 21 * 2
L = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

"To solve this problem, we can use the method of substitution or elimination to find the value of Azibo's points. Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D.

We are given that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

We can set up a system of linear equations using the information given:

1) B = A + 20
2) B = D + 10
3) A + B + D = 45

We can substitute B = A + 20 into equation 3 to get A + (A + 20) + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45.

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into equation 3 to get A + (D + 10) + D = 45. 

This simplifies to A + 2D + 10 = 45.

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and A + 2D + 10 = 45.

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (A + 2D + 10) = 45 - 45.

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0.

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10.

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10.

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation A + 2D + 10 = 45 to get (D - 10) + 2D + 10 = 45.

This simplifies to 3D = 45.

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15.

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = 15 - 10.

This simplifies to A = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the relationship between the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch. Since each page is printed on both sides, we have 2 pages per inch.

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book. 

200 pages per inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:
15 * 60 = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 / 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 * 60 = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"To determine the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate her total sleep duration and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim's usual sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, her usual sleep duration is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her actual wake-up time is 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

Her sleepwalking duration is from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep duration: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

The final answer is: 457"
"To find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially, we need to first find the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of cups.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of spoons.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the total number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital.

1/5 of 1000 = 200

Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied. 

4/5 of 1000 = 800

Now, we need to calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we multiply 50 by 14 (number of days in 2 weeks).

50 * 14 = 700

Now, we add the number of occupied beds initially to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

200 + 700 = 900

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

1000 - 900 = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are to family. Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family, which is (2/3) * 9 = 6.

Now, we need to find out how many non-work emails are not to family. This is 9 - 6 = 3.

Finally, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails (not to family) are to her boyfriend. One-third of these emails are to her boyfriend, which is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find Shawna's father's age, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we know Aliya's age is 3 years. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3. Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Next, we are given that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. To find Shawna's father's age, we multiply Shawna's age by 5. Shawna's father's age = 9 * 5 = 45 years.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from the number reported by Courtney.

20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

The actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38.4}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. If we denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as x, then Jason carried 2x balls, and Jordan carried 4x balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them, which is x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We are also given that Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried 2x balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the equation 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x
Total number of balls = 7 * 1
Total number of balls = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug on the first three days. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes dug on the first three days is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

We are told that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's dive into the problem. Amora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally, but it turned out that only two people would get an equal amount, while the other person would receive 15 more corn chips than the number the others got. If Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, we need to find the total number of corn chips.

Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 70 + 15 (since Collins got 15 more than Amora and Lainey)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 15 = 85

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 70

This confirms that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each. Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We know that Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15
Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The cost of travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of PokÃ©mon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

We know that together they have caught 339 PokÃ©mon, so the first equation is A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the second equation is L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so the third equation is S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Now we can substitute the third equation into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.
9A - 21 = 339.

Now we can add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Now we can divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we need to determine the number of episodes and then multiply it by the length of each episode.

Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can represent the number of episodes as x. According to the problem, there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. This can be expressed as x = 20 / 2.

Solving for x, we get x = 10 episodes.

Now, to find the total time, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to break down the bird's journey into segments and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = speed * time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = speed * time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = speed * time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to add the distances traveled in the two southerly segments and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly segment:
Total distance = Distance traveled in the first segment + Distance traveled in the last segment - Distance traveled in the northerly segment
Total distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta received. We have 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies. Then, she received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. Additionally, she received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.

To add these numbers together, we can start by adding 12 and 6, which is 18. Then, we add 48 to that result, which gives us 66.

Now, let's calculate the number of brownies eaten. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is equivalent to 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

To find the total number of brownies left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to determine the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

To find Nani's sister's age, we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from his age. 25% is equivalent to 0.25. So, 25% of 8 is 8 * 0.25 = 2 years. Since Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, we subtract 2 from Nani's age: 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the weighted average of the time it takes for each type of string.

First, we need to find the total time for each type of string:
- Synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
- Polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
- Hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Next, we calculate the total number of racquets: 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 racquets

Now, we find the weighted average time by multiplying the time for each type of string by the number of racquets and dividing by the total number of racquets:
(45 * 3 + 110 * 5 + 72 * 4) / 12
= (135 + 550 + 288) / 12
= 973 / 12
= 80.92 minutes (rounded to two decimal places)

The final answer is: 80.92"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we need to consider the cost of the first 2 phones and the cost of the remaining 2 phones.

The first 2 phones cost $600 each, so their total cost is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining 2 phones are half price, so each costs $600 / 2 = $300. The total cost for the remaining 2 phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Now, we add the cost of the first 2 phones to the cost of the remaining 2 phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to find the number of players in Zeke's team and add it to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Carlton's team has 13 players. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can find the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

13 + 7 = 20

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to determine the total number of oranges she had initially. Since she bought 12 boxes of oranges and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges she gave away. She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges given away is 4 * 20 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many oranges she had left after giving some away. This is the difference between the total number of oranges and the number of oranges given away: 240 - 80 = 160.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she had left: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Let's denote the number of states in the USA as 'x'. Then, half of 'x' is x/2. We are told that India has 4 more than this, so the number of states in India is x/2 + 4.

We know that the USA has 50 states. Therefore, x = 50.

Now, we can find the number of states in India by substituting the value of x into the expression x/2 + 4. This gives us 50/2 + 4 = 25 + 4 = 29.

To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 50 + 29 = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

The total cost of the items is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to find out how much more he needs to earn. This is calculated by subtracting the amount he has saved from the total cost: $39 - $14 = $25.

Now, we know that Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 Ã· $5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three variables: the number of cherries Robert has (R), the number of cherries Richard has (R), and the number of cherries Jerry has (J). We are given the following information:

1. The total number of cherries is 60: R + J + R = 60
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard: R = R + 10
3. We need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry: R - J

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both Saturday and Sunday. Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10. We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so A = Sunday's apple pie - 4.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Sunday's gingerbread = G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15. We are also given that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday. 
A = Sunday's apple pie - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11.

Next, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday. The cost of gingerbread is $6 per box, and the cost of apple pie is $15 per box.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (G * 6) + (A * 15) = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (Sunday's gingerbread * 6) + (Sunday's apple pie * 15) = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: $\boxed{540}$"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we must first calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use during her 8-day vacation.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce. So, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

To find out how many bottles she will need, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 Ã· 8 = 4

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car. To do this, we multiply the price of the blue car by 0.4.
Price of blue car = $100
Discount = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, we subtract the discount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car.
Price of red car = Price of blue car - Discount
= $100 - $40
= $60

The price of the red car is $60. To find the total cost of both cars, we add their prices together.
Total cost = Price of blue car + Price of red car
= $100 + $60
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B. We are given the following information:

1. E = 19 (Emil's current age)
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad: 24 = 0.5D
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother: 24 = 2B

We can rewrite the equations to represent the current ages of Emil's dad and brother in terms of E:

2. 48 = D (since 24 = 0.5D, multiply both sides by 2)
3. 12 = B (since 24 = 2B, divide both sides by 2)

Now, we can express D and B in terms of E:

2. D = 48 - (E - 5) (since Emil's dad is 5 years older than Emil when he turns 24)
3. B = 12 - (E - 5) (since Emil's brother is 5 years younger than Emil when he turns 24)

We can now set up a system of equations using the expressions for D and B:

D + B = 50 (the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother)

Substituting the expressions for D and B, we get:

(48 - (E - 5)) + (12 - (E - 5)) = 50

Combine like terms:

60 - E + 5 + 12 - E + 5 = 50

Combine like terms:

77 - 2E = 50

Subtract 77 from both sides:

-2E = -27

Divide both sides by -2:

E = 13.5

Now that we have Emil's current age, we can find the current ages of his dad and brother:

D = 48 - (E - 5) = 48 - (13.5 - 5) = 40
B = 12 - (E - 5) = 12 - (13.5 - 5) = 3.5

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is D + B = 40 + 3.5 = 43.5.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of football players, we need to calculate 20% of 30 students. 
20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students.

The remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24 students.

To find the number of cheerleaders or band members, we need to calculate 25% of the remaining 24 students. 
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members. 
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

"To determine the total cost of filling Pat's flower bed, we need to calculate the number of plants she can fit in the bed and then multiply that by the cost of each plant.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract 18 inches from the total length of the flower bed for each plant. However, we also need to subtract the width of the plant itself (12 inches) from the remaining length.

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 18n - 12n = 1320 - 30n.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of 18. 

1/2 of 18 can be calculated by dividing 18 by 2.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

Next, we'll calculate the cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Now, we add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

First, let's find the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers. Since each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil and they are planting 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, we'll calculate the total amount of soil used for the carnations. Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations. So, the total soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, we add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations to find the total amount of soil used for these flowers. 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, we subtract the total soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil to find the amount left for roses. 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Given that each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we then multiply this amount by the number of months in a year to find the total savings in a year: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Now, we divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"To determine the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both tasks simultaneously. 

First, let's calculate the rate at which she peels and cooks shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp per minute and cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she cooks 3 shrimp per minute.

Now, let's calculate the combined rate at which she peels and cooks shrimp. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the rates. The LCM of 6 (peeling rate) and 3 (cooking rate) is 6. This means she can peel and cook 6 shrimp per minute.

To find the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the combined rate: 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Let's start by determining how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the second time. We know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Now, we need to find out how many years passed between the two times Bill saw the comet. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, this is the time interval between the two sightings. 

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to subtract the time interval from the age at which he saw the comet for the second time. 

So, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when his dad saw the comet. Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, Bill was 30 - 15 = 15 years old when his dad was born.

However, we are interested in Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since Bill was 15 years old when his dad was born, and his dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 15 + 30 = 45 years old when he was born. 

Since Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and he was 45 years old when he was born, Bill was 15 - 45 = -30 years old when he saw the comet for the first time. However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 

Three times the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is 3 * 30 = 90 years old. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. 

So, Bill's dad was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when Bill was born. 

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, Bill was 30 - 15 = 15 years old when his dad was born.

However, we are interested in Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since Bill was 15 years old when his dad was born, and his dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 15 + 30 = 45 years old when he was born. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill was born. 

So, Bill was born 75 years after his dad saw the comet. 

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, Bill was 30 + 75 = 105 years old when he saw the comet for the second time. 

Now, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting the time interval from the age at which he saw the comet for the second time. 

So, Bill was 105 - 75 = 30 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and add them together.

First, let's consider the checks for the electric and gas bills. Since he writes 1 check per month for each of these bills, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of checks for these bills is 1 * 12 + 1 * 12 = 24.

Next, we'll consider the checks to the church. Since he writes 2 checks per month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of checks to the church is 2 * 12 = 24.

Now, let's consider the checks to the pest and lawn service. Since he writes 1 check every 3 months, and there are 4 three-month periods in a year, the total number of checks to the pest and lawn service is 1 * 4 = 4.

Now, let's add the total number of checks:
24 (electric and gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that the first plane makes a total of x flights per day. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can set up the equation x/2 = 44. Solving for x, we get x = 88.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2)(x - (3/4)x) = (1/2)(1/4)x = (1/8)x.

Substituting the value of x, we get the number of flights to France as (1/8)(88) = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, let's subtract the total amount of money Adam received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and the ages of Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4, respectively.

The total age of the children can be expressed as: 
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

We also know that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

We can simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
3 + 4 + (7 + W) + W = 20
12 + 2W = 20
2W = 8
W = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"

"To find the number of people in the church next door, we first need to determine the total number of cookies given to the church. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church. To find 1/2 of 1500, we multiply 1500 by 1/2, which is the same as dividing 1500 by 2. 

1500 / 2 = 750

Now, we know that each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received.

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. 

Let's say each kid gets x units of watermelon. Since each adult gets twice as much as each kid, each adult gets 2x units.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each). The total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combine like terms: 6x = 100.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

The final answer is: 33.33"
"To determine the time Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from his total work hours.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes. 

Next, we calculate the time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

To find the latest start time, we subtract the total time required from the target time (5:00 pm). Since we are working with hours and minutes, we'll convert 5:00 pm to a 24-hour clock: 17:00.

17:00 (5:00 pm) - 3 hours = 14:00 (2:00 pm)

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the cost of renting the studio and the cost of students per session.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total earnings per month are $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter as P and for Martha as M. We are given that Peter has 4 boxes and Martha has 7 boxes, and their total number of chocolate bars are 64 and 56 respectively.

We can set up the following system of linear equations:

4P = 64
7M = 56

To find the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha, we can solve these equations.

First, we solve for P:
P = 64 / 4
P = 16

Next, we solve for M:
M = 56 / 7
M = 8

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
P - M = 16 - 8 = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 of 50 is calculated as (3 * 50) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we add the initial population and the number of babies born. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks. 

Let's denote the number of red sticks as R, the number of blue sticks as B, and the number of yellow sticks as Y. We are given the following information:

1. R = 9 (number of red sticks)
2. B = R + 5 (number of blue sticks is 5 more than red)
3. Y = B - 3 (number of yellow sticks is 3 less than blue)

We can substitute the value of R into equation 2 to find B:
B = 9 + 5
B = 14

Now, we can substitute the value of B into equation 3 to find Y:
Y = 14 - 3
Y = 11

Now that we have the values of R, B, and Y, we can find the total number of sticks by adding them together:
Total = R + B + Y
Total = 9 + 14 + 11
Total = 34

The final answer is: 34"

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles
Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.
Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the 3000 students are over 16 years old. This means 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16.

Next, we find that one-fourth of the students over 16 are male. So, 1500 / 4 = 375 students are male, leaving 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16. This means 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are under 16.

We also know that one-half of the students under 16 are male. So, 1500 / 2 = 750 students are male, leaving 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, let's start with Bethany, who can run 10 laps in one hour. 

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Next, Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Then, Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. 
So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

First, let's find the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day. Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Since Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

The amount of water remaining in the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours, and then it loses 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%.

Let's start by finding the charge remaining after 8 hours. We can set up an equation to represent the charge remaining after 8 hours:

Initial charge - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Initial charge - 45% - 21% = 28%

Combine like terms:

Initial charge - 66% = 28%

Add 66% to both sides:

Initial charge = 94%

However, this is the charge remaining after 8 hours. To find the initial charge, we need to consider the charge lost in the first 5 hours. Let's set up an equation to represent the charge remaining after 5 hours:

Initial charge - (9% * 5) = Charge remaining after 5 hours

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Initial charge - 45% = Charge remaining after 5 hours

We know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 94% - 21% = 73%. So, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Initial charge - 45% = 73%

Add 45% to both sides:

Initial charge = 118%

However, this is not possible since the initial charge cannot be greater than 100%. This means that our initial assumption about the charge remaining after 8 hours is incorrect.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. We also know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%. This means that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the charge remaining after 5 hours:

Initial charge - (9% * 5) = Charge remaining after 5 hours

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Initial charge - 45% = Charge remaining after 5 hours

We know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 34% + 6% = 40%. So, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Initial charge - 45% = 40%

Add 45% to both sides:

Initial charge = 85%

The final answer is: 85"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. To calculate 20% of $10,000, we multiply $10,000 by 0.2, which equals $2000.

Now, we need to divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000) to find out how many weeks she needs to work.

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

Therefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying the other fruits.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to determine the total number of packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Since Anne kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends to find out how many packs each friend received. 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are in 1.3 packs. 

1.3 packs = 1 pack + 0.3 packs. 
1 pack has 60 pieces, so 0.3 packs have 0.3 * 60 = 18 pieces.

Now, we add the pieces from 1 pack and 0.3 packs to find the total number of pieces each friend received.

60 pieces (from 1 pack) + 18 pieces (from 0.3 packs) = 78 pieces.

The final answer is: 78"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with a 5% annual increase, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

Where:
A = final amount
P = principal (initial price) = $120
r = annual interest rate (as a decimal) = 0.05
n = number of years = 3

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = $120(1 + 0.05)^3
A = $120(1.05)^3
A = $120 * 1.157625
A = $138.94

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to determine the number of pictures in each album. 

Let's divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find the number of pictures per album.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Since 3 albums were selfies only, the number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums = 5 albums. 
The number of portraits is 5 albums * 9 pictures per album = 45 portraits.

However, we are given that 2 of the albums were portraits. This means the 5 albums of portraits include the 2 portrait albums and 3 other albums. The 3 other albums must be selfies. 

The number of portraits is 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits.

The number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The total number of portraits and selfies is 18 portraits + 27 selfies = 45.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'.

We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12. The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write another equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) x = 2y
2) 4x + 12y = 120

We can substitute the expression for x from the first equation into the second equation to solve for y. Substituting x = 2y into the second equation gives us:

4(2y) + 12y = 120

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8y + 12y = 120
20y = 120

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

y = 120 / 20
y = 6

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the value of x by substituting y into the first equation:

x = 2y
x = 2(6)
x = 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"

"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to calculate their daily ore production and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

First, let's determine the daily ore production of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day. 

Now, we need to find out how much ore he can mine with a steel pickaxe. A steel pickaxe allows him to mine 50% more ore than an iron pickaxe. To find 50% of 24 pounds, we multiply 24 by 0.5, which equals 12 pounds. Therefore, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now that we know one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, we can find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day. We multiply 36 pounds by 40 dwarves: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 pounds by 30 to find the total ore production for the month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

To do this, we can subtract 100% from 102% to get -2%. However, this is not a valid probability. Instead, we can subtract 100% from 102% to get 2% and then subtract 2% from 100% to get 98%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to subtract the number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question asks for the number of tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, implying that the remaining tickets are for guests.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans. We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is 2 * 75 = 150.

Now, we need to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. We are given that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This can be represented as a ratio: 3 small beans = 1 medium-sized bean.

To find the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we can set up a proportion: 3 small beans / 1 medium-sized bean = x small beans / 150 medium-sized beans. 

Cross-multiplying, we get 3 * 150 = 1 * x, which simplifies to 450 = x.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

The final answer is: $\boxed{450}$"
"To determine Melissa's hourly pay after expenses, we need to calculate her net earnings and then divide that by the total number of hours she worked.

First, let's calculate her total earnings: 
Total earnings = 3 days * $15 per day = $45

Next, we need to calculate her total expenses: 
Total expenses = 3 days * $3 per day = $9

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Since Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, we need to find the total number of hours she worked: 
Total hours = 6 hours per day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses: 
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils, then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of intervals between the bottles and then multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of intervals, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 intervals

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of intervals by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 intervals * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of packs Uncle Franky can make, we first need to calculate the total number of apples he has. Since he ordered two boxes, and each box contains 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box: 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Each pack contains 8 apples. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 80 / 8 = 10.

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheese, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased.

First, we calculate the cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese by multiplying the price per pound ($11) by the number of pounds (2). This gives us 2 * $11 = $22.

Next, we calculate the cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese by multiplying the price per pound ($6) by the number of pounds (3). This gives us 3 * $6 = $18.

Now, we add the cost of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese to find the total cost of the cheese. $22 + $18 = $40.

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the initial amount of money Amor had, which is $50. $50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn and his new income after college.

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost by not working while in college is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width, so the area of one piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them together.

First, let's find the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. One-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

Next, let's find the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than twice as many as Tuesday is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first convert Xavier's height from feet to inches and then add the growth.

Xavier's height in inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches
Cole's height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height
Difference = 52 inches - 51 inches
Difference = 1 inch

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's find the total number of days in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Next, we need to convert 3/8ths of a day to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

To simplify the equation, we can multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To calculate the price of the car in 2010, we need to apply the constant depreciation rate of 21% per year for three years, from 2007 to 2010.

The formula for calculating the price after depreciation is: 
Price after depreciation = Initial price * (1 - depreciation rate)^number of years

Initial price = $20,000
Depreciation rate = 21% or 0.21
Number of years = 3 (from 2007 to 2010)

Price in 2010 = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
= $20,000 * (0.79)^3
= $20,000 * 0.491095
= $9,821.90

The final answer is: $9821.90"
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so the number of English books is 50 / 2 = 25.
10% of the books are written in German, so the number of German books is 50 * 0.1 = 5.

The total number of books written in English and German is 25 + 5 = 30.
Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the total number of English and German books from the total number of books: 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to calculate her daily water consumption in gallons and then multiply it by the number of days.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert her daily water consumption to gallons by dividing 8 cups by 16 cups/gallon.

8 cups/day Ã· 16 cups/gallon = 0.5 gallons/day

Now, we multiply her daily water consumption in gallons by the number of days to find the total amount of water she drinks in 30 days.

0.5 gallons/day * 30 days = 15 gallons

"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people at each stop and add them up.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
140 - 50 + 100 = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

"To determine the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of James' insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

"To determine the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as J, the number of slices Becky ate as B, and the number of slices Silvia ate as S.

We know that each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices is 8 * 4 = 32.

We are given the following information:
1. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake: B = J + 3
2. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake: S = 2J
3. Becky ate 10 slices: B = 10
4. The total number of slices eaten is 32: B + J + S = 32

We can substitute the value of B from equation 3 into equation 1 to find J:
10 = J + 3
J = 7

Now that we have the value of J, we can find S using equation 2:
S = 2J
S = 2 * 7
S = 14

Now that we have the values of J and S, we can find the total number of slices eaten by substituting these values into equation 4:
B + J + S = 32
10 + 7 + 14 = 32

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x and the time Betsy's part took as y. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so we can write the equation:

y = x + 18

We also know that the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, which is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan. So, we can write the equation:

x + y = 98

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve for x and y by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

Rearrange the first equation to isolate y:
y = x + 18

Substitute this expression for y into the second equation:
x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y by substituting x into one of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:
y = x + 18
y = 40 + 18
y = 58

So, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down the expenses into their respective components.

First, let's calculate the cost of the 30-minute visit. Since the doctor charges $300/hour, we need to find the cost for half an hour. To do this, we multiply the hourly rate by 0.5 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and 30 minutes is half of that). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Next, we calculate the cost of the painkillers. The doctor prescribes 30 painkillers at $4 each, so the total cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. To find the total cost of parking, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours: $6 * 2 = $12.

Lastly, we have the fixed fee for the cast, which is $200.

Now, let's add all the costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

To do this, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by the number of days in the work week: 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7, which equals 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total cost for small coupons. There are 700 small coupons, and each costs 5 cents. So, the total cost for small coupons is 700 * 5 cents.

700 * 5 = 3500 cents

Next, let's find the total cost for big coupons. There are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so there are 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, so the total cost for big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents.

1400 * 15 = 21000 cents

Now, we add the total cost for small coupons and big coupons to find the total cost of postage.

3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars

First, we need to find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Since he ordered 3 less than ten, we subtract 3 from 10.

10 - 3 = 7

Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

7 * 4 = 28

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, there were 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left. Sidney ordered 3 more sub sandwiches. 

3 + 3 = 6

Now, there are 6 meatball sub sandwiches left. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

6 * 4 = 24

Since the promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter by considering it as 3 sets of 2 pounds. 

For each set of 2 pounds, the cost is:
- 1 pound at full price: $4.00
- 1 pound at half off: $4.00 / 2 = $2.00

The total cost for each set of 2 pounds is: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00
Since there are 3 sets of 2 pounds, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is: 3 * $6.00 = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and multiply it by the cost per guest, then add the initial fee.

First, let's find the total number of guests invited. Kayla invited her 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. That's a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

However, 4 people said they could not come, so we need to subtract those from the total number of guests. 45 - 4 = 41 guests will be attending the party.

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests.

The cost per additional guest is $6, so we multiply the number of additional guests by the cost per guest. 21 * 6 = $126.

Now, we add the initial fee to the cost for the additional guests. $126 + $125 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To find the amount of money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to determine the amount of money they each had initially and then subtract the amount they spent.

Let's start with Maggie. Since she spent a quarter of her money, she has 3/4 of her money left. If we let x be the initial amount of money Maggie had, then 3/4x = $60. To find x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3, which gives us x = $60 * (4/3) = $80. This means Maggie initially had $80.

Now, let's find the amount of money Maggie spent. Since she spent a quarter of her money, she spent 1/4 * $80 = $20.

Next, let's consider Riza. Since she spent one-third of her money, she has 2/3 of her money left. If we let y be the initial amount of money Riza had, then 2/3y = $60. To find y, we can multiply both sides by 3/2, which gives us y = $60 * (3/2) = $90. This means Riza initially had $90.

Now, let's find the amount of money Riza spent. Since she spent one-third of her money, she spent 1/3 * $90 = $30.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have: $80 - $20 = $60 (Maggie's remaining money) + $90 - $30 = $60 (Riza's remaining money). However, this is incorrect as we are adding the money they spent to the money they have left. We should be adding the money they have left. So, the correct calculation is $60 + $60 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats.

We know that the total number of bananas is 315 and they last for a week, which is 7 days. 
So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315. To find the total number of bananas eaten each day, we divide 315 by 7: 315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now we know that the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. So, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first puzzle and the second puzzle.

The first puzzle had 500 pieces, and Teddy finished half of it. To find half of 500, we divide 500 by 2. 

500 / 2 = 250

So, Teddy placed 250 pieces in the first puzzle. 

The second puzzle also had 500 pieces, and Teddy finished the entire puzzle. Therefore, he placed 500 pieces in the second puzzle.

To find the total number of pieces Teddy placed, we add the number of pieces from the first puzzle and the second puzzle.

250 + 500 = 750

The final answer is: 750"
"To determine the number of quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen. 

15 roses is 1 and 3 roses. 1 dozen is 12 roses, so she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses. 

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total amount from each item and then add them together.

"To determine the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to break down the sequence of events and calculate the time intervals between them.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. This means the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. We need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far. 

She saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so the total number of toothpicks she saved is 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, and she already has 120, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs: 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week: 80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is:
2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:
1500 * 1.2 = $1800

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price he paid:
2000 - 1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
(200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish per second.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since there are 5 springs, and each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is given as 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we are told that Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score. This can be represented as an equation: Frankie's score = 2 * Binkie's score + 15.

Substituting the value of Binkie's score into the equation, we get: Frankie's score = 2 * 90 + 15.

Simplifying the equation, we get: Frankie's score = 180 + 15.

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195.

"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's find the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Now, we calculate the cost of buying 40 bananas individually: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the amount of money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x' and the amount of fence Harry gets as 'y'. We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

x + y = 100

We are also given that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write another equation:

y = x + 60

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve for 'x' by substituting the second equation into the first equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

Now that we have the value of 'x', we can find the value of 'y' by substituting 'x' into one of the original equations. Let's use the second equation:

y = x + 60
y = 20 + 60
y = 80

However, the question asks for the amount of fence left over for Sam, which is the value of 'x'. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the rate at which the crocodile grows per year, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. 

Let's set up a proportion to find the growth rate per year. If the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, it grows 1 inch in 4/8 years, or 1/2 year. To find the growth per year, we can multiply this fraction by 2.

Growth per year = (1/2 year) * 2
Growth per year = 1 year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 1 year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 13 inches

"To find the total earnings from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike:

"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes for the regular classes and the extra classes. 

First, let's find the total minutes for the regular classes: 
6 periods * 40 minutes per period = 240 minutes per day
240 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1200 minutes per week

Next, let's find the total minutes for the extra classes: 
2 classes * 40 minutes per class = 80 minutes per day
80 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 400 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes: 
1200 minutes per week + 400 minutes per week = 1600 minutes per week

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. 
1/16 of the total minutes per week is spent on Saturday and Sunday. 
Since there are 7 days in a week, the total minutes per week is 7 * 24 * 60 = 1680 minutes per week
1/16 * 1680 minutes per week = 105 minutes per day
105 minutes per day * 2 days = 210 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes, and the extra minutes for Saturday and Sunday: 
1600 minutes per week + 210 minutes per week = 1810 minutes per week

Finally, let's convert the total minutes to hours: 
1810 minutes per week / 60 minutes per hour = 30.17 hours per week

"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate. 

First, we know that the Allosaurus ate half of what the velociraptors had. So, the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. The velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate. So, the T-Rex ate 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, which means the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the conditional probability of her choosing a shaken can given the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, leaving 3 shaken and 9 unshaken. She then took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 3 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 2 shaken and 5 unshaken. However, we need to consider the fact that Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, which means there is only 1 shaken soda left. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of remaining shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to determine the number of days between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan. It was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels. They were 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to find the total cost of the new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

Finally, we subtract the $15.00 return from the initial charge and then add the total cost of the new purchases: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00, then $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's dive into the problem at hand. We have a jellyfish tank with an unknown number of jellyfish. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To find Caroline's age, we need to determine the relationship between the three individuals. We know Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris. This means Ben's age is 2 multiplied by Chris's age.

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3, as Caroline is three times older than Ben.

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age

"To determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, we need to consider her desired retirement income, the number of years she plans to live in retirement, and her current salary.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual retirement income. She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000 in retirement. 

Annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

Total savings needed = Annual retirement income * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Next, we need to calculate how many years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of 20% of her annual salary, which is $20,000 per year.

Number of years = Total savings needed / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to perform a two-step division process. 

First, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Next, we divide the result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

Therefore, the length of each final cut is 5 cm.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can set up the equation: 0.4x = 240, where x is the total number of students.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.4: x = 240 / 0.4 = 600.

Now that we know the total number of students is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total: 600 - 240 = 360.

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the coupon discount.

The cost of the pots is $19. The cost of the garden soil is $26. 

First, we add these two costs together: $19 + $26 = $45.

Next, we subtract the discount of $7 from the total: $45 - $7 = $38.

Therefore, the total amount my mom spent at the gardening shop is $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and divide it by the total number of women.

The total height of the 4 inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2 inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The total number of women is 3 + 3 = 6.

The average height of heels is the total height divided by the total number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in 30 days, we first need to calculate the daily mileage requirement.

The total distance to be covered is 9,300 miles, and the time constraint is 30 days. 

To find the daily mileage requirement, we divide the total distance by the number of days: 9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.

Since Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, her current daily mileage is 125 * 2 = 250 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we subtract her current daily mileage from the required daily mileage: 310 miles - 250 miles = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to follow the order of operations: first, add the amount he saved to the initial amount, and then subtract the amounts he spent.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
Now, we subtract the amount he spent on a comic book: $32 - $5 = $27.
Finally, we subtract the amount he spent on a puzzle: $27 - $19 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Anna initially had a budget of $16 and spent $4, so we need to find out how much money she had left. To do this, we subtract $4 from $16.

$16 - $4 = $12

Now, we know Anna spent $10 on the two books because she had $12 left and ended up with $2. To find the amount she spent, we subtract $2 from $12.

$12 - $2 = $10

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent ($10) by 2.

$10 / 2 = $5

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can set up a proportion. Let's denote the unknown time as 'x' minutes. The proportion can be set up as follows:

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 459 blinks / x minutes

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:
255x = 459 * 5

Now, we can simplify the equation:
255x = 2295

Next, we divide both sides by 255 to isolate 'x':
x = 2295 / 255

x = 9

"To determine the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to consider the round trip distance. 

First, we calculate the one-way distance using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time
Given that John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to reach his parents, the one-way distance is:
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

However, John visits his parents twice a month. To find the total distance driven in a month, we multiply the round-trip distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days: 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

Now, we know that Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks in 7 days. To find this distance, we divide the total distance Sofie walks by 2: 70 / 2 = 35 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 2 workers producing 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers producing 4 toys an hour. The total number of toys produced by these 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since all 5 workers work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 10 hours is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

Let's denote the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour as x. The total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 200 + x * 10.

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order, so the total number of toys needed is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 420.

We can set up the equation: 200 + 10x = 420.

Now, let's solve for x:
10x = 420 - 200
10x = 220
x = 220 / 10
x = 22

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to find the weight of each of his dogs and add them together.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. To find one-fourth of 60, we divide 60 by 4, which equals 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. To find half of 60, we divide 60 by 2, which equals 30 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

The total weight of all the dogs is 45 (Elijah's dogs) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

"To determine the total number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's he has. 

First, we multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Next, we multiply the total ounces by the number of M&M's per ounce: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to calculate half of the circumference of the earth and then divide that by the distance Alfie flies per day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Now, we divide the total distance (20,000 km) by the distance Alfie flies per day (400 km) to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote Vince's current age as V.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Since Liam is 16 years old now, two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. We can set up the equation:

14 = 2V

To find Vince's current age, we need to solve for V. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

V = 14 / 2
V = 7

However, this is Vince's age two years ago. To find his current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago:

Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can say A = M.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so C + S = 30.

We also know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so C = S + 12.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S + 12 + S = 30, which simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 200 crayons, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the total amount John makes from selling the planks, we first need to find out how many logs he can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, we divide the total feet of usable wood by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. To find the total number of planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

Finally, we calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate their individual salaries and then add them up.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns half of what she earns, which is $5000 / 2 = $2500 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $2500 = $7500 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $7500 = $15,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $2500 + $15,000 = $20,000 + $20,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation involving distance, rate, and time. Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach can be calculated as distance/speed = 2/x. This is equal to 40 minutes. So, we have the equation 2/x = 40.

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

We can now calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we need to calculate how much she has saved so far and then determine how much more she needs to save.

Jane has been saving $4 per week for 8 weeks. To find the total amount she has saved, we multiply her weekly savings by the number of weeks:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"Let's tackle this problem step by step.

We are given that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, before receiving 2 dozen more marbles, Bob had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 36: 36 - 10 = 26.

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles if he loses 10 of the marbles he has.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. 

The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. 

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5. 

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40. 

Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 / 2 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 >= 80
165 + 5x >= 80
5x >= 80 - 165
5x >= -85
x >= -85 / 5
x >= -17

However, since x represents a temperature, it must be a positive value. Therefore, we need to find the minimum value of x that satisfies the condition.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 21 days in three weeks, we multiply the number of cows brought per day by the number of days.

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Now, we add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with a 10% discount, and then divide that by the total number of bagels.

First, we find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Next, we calculate the 10% discount on the total cost. 10% of $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00. Subtracting the discount from the total cost, we get $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Finally, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost of each single bagel. $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"Let's break down the problem into two variables: the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate (S) and the number of potatoes it takes to make one scoop of mashed potatoes (P).

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes: P = (6 - 3) / (3 - 1)

First, let's simplify the second equation: P = 3 / 2 = 1.5

Now, we know that Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes: S = 23 - 5 = 18

Since it takes 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is S * P = 18 * 1.5 = 27

"Let's break down the problem into two variables: the number of sunflowers sold per day (S) and the number of bouquets sold per day (B). We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers in the bouquets: S + 12B.

We also know that each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8, and Faraday earns $26 from the sunflowers and $56 from the bouquets per day. This gives us two equations:

2S + 8B = 26 (equation 1: total earnings from sunflowers)
8B = 56 (equation 2: total earnings from bouquets)

We can solve equation 2 for B by dividing both sides by 8:

B = 56 / 8
B = 7

Now that we have the value of B, we can substitute it into equation 1 to solve for S:

2S + 8(7) = 26
2S + 56 = 26
2S = -30
S = -15

However, since we cannot sell a negative number of sunflowers, this solution is not valid. Let's re-examine our equations. We can simplify equation 2 by dividing both sides by 8:

B = 7

Now, we can substitute B into equation 1:

2S + 8(7) = 26

"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100 investment. Since each rock costs $5, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * $5 = $100

However, since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 + $40 = $140

Now, let's find the difference between the total cost and the revenue:

$140 - $84 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum of these values.

First, let's calculate the number of days it will take Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

1. For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
2. For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
3. For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can only complete the project once all scenes are done, we need to find the maximum of these values. The maximum of 9, 6, and 7 is 9.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

First, we need to determine the total number of eggs. A dozen is equal to 12, so three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children: 36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

Therefore, each child receives 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May, we need to calculate the daily cost and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

Each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, and Jen has 3 fish. Therefore, the daily cost is 3 * $1 = $3.

May has 31 days. To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days: $3 * 31 = $93.

The final answer is: $93"
"To find the total number of roses Patricia has now, we need to follow a step-by-step process.

First, we need to determine the number of roses she had after giving some away. We start with 30 roses and subtract the 24 roses she gave to her mother.

30 (initial roses) - 24 (roses given away) = 6

Now, we know Patricia had 6 roses left. To find the total number of roses she has now, we need to add the 15 roses she bought.

6 (remaining roses) + 15 (new roses) = 21

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

"When calculating the probability of two independent events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event. 

In this case, the first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which translates to a decimal probability of 0.2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the combined probability of both tickets winning, we multiply these two probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's dive into the problem at hand. We have three individuals - Carlos, Jim, and Carrey - who collected seashells at the beach. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Additionally, Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as R. Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, the number of seashells Carlos collected is 2R. We are given that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so the number of seashells Jim collected is 2R + 5. We also know that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can write the equation:

2R + 5 = 27

Solving for R, we get:
2R = 22
R = 11

Now that we know Carrey collected 11 seashells, we can find the number of seashells Carlos collected:
Carlos collected 2R = 2(11) = 22 seashells

We also know that Jim collected 27 seashells.

To find out how many seashells each person gets when they divide the total number of seashells equally among themselves, we need to find the total number of seashells first:
Total seashells = 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60

Now, we divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people):
60 / 3 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays. To find the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays, we multiply the number of carrots he eats each day by the number of weekdays: 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. To find the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend, we add the number of carrots he eats on Saturday and Sunday: 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 + 10 = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since it's 60% longer than the first song, we'll find 60% of 5 minutes. 

60% as a decimal is 0.6, so we multiply 5 by 0.6 to find 60% of 5 minutes.

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

Now, we add this 60% increase to the original length of the first song to find the total length of the second song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

The first song is 5 minutes and the second song is 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add these two lengths together.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To calculate the total profit, we need to find the profit from each day and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the profit from Monday. Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each, so the total cost price for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

Next, let's calculate the profit from Tuesday. Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each, so the total cost price for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, let's add the profit from Monday and Tuesday to find the total profit. $40 + $80 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now that we know Carl's height, we can find the length of his cane, which is half of his height.

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

"To determine the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to find the multiplier for 20% to get to 100%. This is done by dividing 100 by 20, which equals 5.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we multiply the number of bottles needed for one person by 2300. This gives us 5 * 2300 = 11500 bottles.

However, Hortex can only produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

Therefore, Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles per day to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to consider the total number of babies wearing bows and the number of those wearing purple bows.

First, let's find the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 of the 8 babies are wearing purple, which is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Next, we need to find the number of babies wearing purple and bows. 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows, which is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

Now, let's find the total number of babies wearing bows. We know that 2 babies are wearing blue and bows, and 2 babies are wearing purple and bows. So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 + 2 = 4.

Now, we can find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple: (2 / 4) = 1/2.

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/2) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%.

Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday to the reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136
Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 4043

Now, let's subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: 1125"
"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, let's calculate the amount of land he sold in the first two transactions. He sold half of his 80 square meters for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. 

The cost per square meter for the first sale is $50 / 40 = $1.25 per square meter.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. 

The cost per square meter for the second sale is $30 / 20 = $1.5 per square meter.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. We need to find the total amount of money he earned from the first two sales and add it to the amount he earned from the third sale.

The total amount of money he earned from the first two sales is the sum of the money earned from each sale. 

Money earned from the first sale = 40 * $1.25 = $50
Money earned from the second sale = 20 * $1.5 = $30

Total money earned from the first two sales = $50 + $30 = $80

The amount of money he earned from the third sale is 20 * $3 = $60.

Total money earned = $80 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, we can express this relationship as an equation: Geb = (1/2) * Haley - 10. Substituting Haley's age into the equation, we get Geb = (1/2) * 26 - 10.

To solve for Geb, we first calculate half of 26, which is 13. Then, we subtract 10 from 13 to find Geb's age.

Geb = 13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2.

6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of eggs found by each person, we need to follow the given information:

- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the size of the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to analyze the pattern of fruit production.

The production of the tree follows a pattern where each year's production is a multiple of the initial amount (50 fruits) based on the age of the tree. 

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): Since the 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree. The 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, the 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

The final answer is: 2350"
"To find the amount of money Jack has now, we need to determine 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 is calculated by dividing $100 by 5, which equals $20.

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

We can rewrite the first two equations as:

1) R = 4B
2) B = Y - 7
3) R + B + Y = 37

Substituting equation (1) into equation (3), we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting equation (2) into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's dive into the problem.

We are given that Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given thrice as much, which is $15. After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money.

Let's denote the amount given to the little sister as 'x'. Then, Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, we can set up the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation: (15 - x) = 12.

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 15 from both sides: -x = -3.

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get x = 3.

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's dive into the problem. We have a wall mural with four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. The mural uses equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and half of the mural is yellow. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the total amount of red, white, and purple paint as 3x, since there are equal amounts of each. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow, so the other half is 6 pints, which is equal to 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

Next, we need to find the area of the living room. It's given that the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Now, we know the area of the rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"
"The problem describes a geometric sequence where the first term (a) is 3, and the common ratio (r) is 2. We need to find the sum of the first five terms of this sequence.

The formula to find the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is: S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

In this case, a = 3, r = 2, and n = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S_5 = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S_5 = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
S_5 = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
S_5 = 93

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to determine the number of pods in the new box. Since it has 20% more pods than the regular box of 100, we calculate the additional pods as 20% of 100, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20. Therefore, the new box contains 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

4. He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

The final numerical answer is: $300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, let's break down the information given.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days he can use the chalk after Monday.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to determine the total number of students on varsity first.

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

The number of teeth the dentist caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

Now, we need to find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes. To do this, we divide the total number of teeth the dentist fixes (15) by the total number of James' teeth (30), and then multiply by 100.

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the correct answer is 50%."

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

"To find out how many books Bob can buy in total, we need to determine the number of sets of 100 books he can buy with his $27000. 

First, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of 100 books: $27000 / $500 = 54. This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books.

Since each set contains 100 books, we multiply the number of sets by the number of books per set: 54 sets * 100 books/set = 5400 books.

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books Bob can buy per school: 5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school.

"Let's break down the events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples. Total apples = 1 (in pocket) + 5 (new) = 6.
3. He put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 5 apples in his pocket. Total apples = 1 (outside) + 5 (in pocket) = 6.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples. Total apples = 6 (from previous step) + 6 (new) = 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which they melt per minute, we divide 2 by 15, which equals 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate of snowballs by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate: (1/3) - (2/15). To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15. So, we convert 1/3 to 5/15. Now, we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how long it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Time = Number of snowballs / Rate = 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the number of bandages they had left after the first day is x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, the number of bandages they had left after the second day is (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. So, the number of bandages they had left after the third day is ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April. Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

First, we know Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

We also know that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles, so the cost per bottle is $600 / 10 = $60.

The number of bottles of cognac is twice the number of bottles of scotch, which is 2 * 10 = 20 bottles.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, which is equivalent to 1.5 times the cost of the scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 * 1.5 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day. Since Mr. Julius planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, and he planted 20 White Oak trees, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day is 2 * 20 = 40.

On the second day, he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day. To find 1/4 of 40, we multiply 40 by 1/4, which is 40 * 1/4 = 10. So, he planted 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's find the total number of White Oak trees planted over the two days. On the first day, he planted 20 White Oak trees. On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.

Now, let's add the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Lodgepole Pine: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer left after all the incidents and then divide it by the number of people at the party.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were stolen by his children, so the remaining amount is 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. So, the amount each person got is 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"To solve the problem, we need to translate the given statement into a mathematical equation. The statement ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be represented as 4x + 8, where x is the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

We are given that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish.

One-third of 66 = 66 / 3 = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. First, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes.

Total fish = 66
Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish without red stripes = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish.

5/11 of 44 = (5/11) * 44 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes.

Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish with blue stripes = 20
Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had, subtract the colors she lost, and then subtract the colors she used up.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets. In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one palette, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the given information step by step.

First, we know Mattison's height is 60 inches. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so we multiply his height by 7 to find the total height of the house: 60 * 7 = 420 inches.

Next, we're told the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the first floor's height from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Finally, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house: 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share.

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.  Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day.  Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.  Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

The total amount of water removed is 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed. Since we don't know the actual guess, we will assume that the question is asking for the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans that would be expected if the jar was packed to 80% efficiency.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans expected
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

"To find the length of the longer piece, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we need to establish a ratio between the number of meatballs and the amount of seasoning. Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, and he adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

We can set up a proportion to find the total amount of seasoning needed:

Meatballs per pound : Total meatballs = Seasoning per pound : Total seasoning needed
16 : 80 = 2 : x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

16x = 80 * 2
16x = 160

Now, we can divide both sides by 16 to find x:

x = 160 / 16
x = 10

Therefore, Aiden needs 10 tablespoons of seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x and the number of brownies as y.

From the problem statement, we know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:

y = 3x - 2

We also know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10. This can be expressed as:

x + y = 10

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) y = 3x - 2
2) x + y = 10

We can substitute the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y by substituting x into one of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:

y = 3x - 2
y = 3(3) - 2
y = 9 - 2
y = 7

However, we are only asked for the number of cupcakes, which is x. Therefore, the final answer is:

"To calculate the total cost, let's start with the manicure and pedicure prices. A manicure starts at $35, and a pedicure starts at $40. 

The discount offered for both services is 20%. To find the discount amount, we multiply the price of each service by 0.2. The discount on the manicure is 0.2 * 35 = $7, and the discount on the pedicure is 0.2 * 40 = $8.

The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15.

Now, let's subtract the total discount from the original prices to get the discounted prices. The manicure price after the discount is $35 - $7 = $28, and the pedicure price after the discount is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in 3 days and then divide it by the total distance between Alaska and Texas.

First, let's find the distance covered by Michael in 3 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, he traveled for 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance covered = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance covered by the total distance and multiplying by 100.

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

Therefore, the correct answer is 60%."
"To find the initial number of grapes, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother then used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Next, their mother used the remaining grapes to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is 36 / 12 = 3 pies.

The total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.

Now, we know that the total number of grapes used by all three is 36 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) + 36 (by their mother) = 102 grapes.

Since the mother used all the remaining grapes to make 3 pies, we can conclude that the initial number of grapes is 102.

The final answer is: $\boxed{102}$"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to determine the number of teachers who were not sick and then add the number of substitute teachers.

First, let's find the number of teachers who were not sick. We subtract the number of teachers who were sick from the total number of teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of teachers sick = 13

Number of teachers not sick = Total number of teachers - Number of teachers sick
= 82 - 13
= 69

Now, we add the number of substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were not sick to find the total number of teachers at school.

Number of substitute teachers = 9

Total number of teachers at school = Number of teachers not sick + Number of substitute teachers
= 69 + 9
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. 
The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.
The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of the macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00 per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To determine the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time available for cleaning and the total time required to clean all the classrooms.

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task, and they work 8 hours a day. Therefore, the total time available for cleaning is 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

Next, we need to calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom, the total time required is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

To convert the total time required to hours, we divide by 60: 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning classrooms is 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the capacity of each shelf. 

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase: 
Middle shelf 1 + Middle shelf 2 + Bottom shelf + Top shelf = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are needed to hold all of them. 
To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 
110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total cost of the eggs, we first need to calculate the cost of five dozens. 

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's determine how many sets of 3 eggs Rose can sell. 

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since she sells each set for $1, the total revenue will be:

20 sets * $1/set = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to calculate the number of hats that are not red. Half of the hats are red, which is 100 * 0.5 = 50 red hats.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Now, we need to find 3/5 of the remaining hats, which are blue. To do this, we multiply 50 by 3/5, which is the same as multiplying 50 by 0.6. So, 50 * 0.6 = 30 blue hats.

Now, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find the number of white hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out her total required score. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, and the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110, we can calculate her required score as follows:

70% of 110 questions is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions she got right on the first test. 
60% of 70 questions is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get a total of 77 questions right, and she got 42 questions right on the first test, we can find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test by subtracting the questions she got right on the first test from her total required score:

77 (required score) - 42 (questions right on the first test) = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B.

We know that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write this as B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which means the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116. This can be expressed as S + B = 116.

Now, we can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

The final answer is: 96"

"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the car dealership, 1 will buy a car. This means that to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the car dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 person comes into the car dealership. To find the number of telephone calls needed to get 30 customers, we can set up a proportion:

25 telephone calls / 1 customer = x telephone calls / 30 customers

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

25 * 30 = 1 * x
750 = x

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of flashlights. There are 4 people, and each person has a flashlight, so the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's find the total number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

"Given that the number of robots is half the number of helmets, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs, we can establish a ratio of 1:2:4 between robots, helmets, and footballs, respectively.

Since we know there are 20 helmets, we can use this ratio to find the number of robots and footballs. 

The ratio of helmets to robots is 2:1, so the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.
The ratio of helmets to footballs is 1:2, so the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

To find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together: 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 70.

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to consider the cost of the main phone and the additional phones.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining four days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people. 
On the second day, Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

"To find the total number of popcorn pieces, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade to be made. Since Tim wants to make 4 gallons for the party and an extra gallon for Allen, the total amount of lemonade is 5 gallons.

Each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice. Therefore, the total amount of lemon juice needed is 5 cups.

The extra tart lemonade requires twice the amount of lemon juice as the regular lemonade. Since the regular lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon, the extra tart lemonade requires 2 cups of lemon juice per gallon. For 1 gallon of extra tart lemonade, Tim needs 2 cups of lemon juice.

To find the number of lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade, we divide the amount of lemon juice required (2 cups) by the amount of lemon juice yielded by 1 lemon (1/6 cup). 

2 cups / (1/6 cup/lemon) = 2 * 6 = 12 lemons

For the regular lemonade, we need 5 cups of lemon juice. To find the number of lemons needed, we divide the amount of lemon juice required (5 cups) by the amount of lemon juice yielded by 1 lemon (1/6 cup).

5 cups / (1/6 cup/lemon) = 5 * 6 = 30 lemons

The total number of lemons needed is the sum of the lemons needed for the regular lemonade and the extra tart lemonade.

Total lemons = 12 lemons (for the extra tart lemonade) + 30 lemons (for the regular lemonade) = 42 lemons

When Elvis travels west for 5 hours at 18mph, he covers a distance of 18 * 5 = 90 miles. 

Then, he turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed, covering a distance of 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since he traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we can find the net displacement by subtracting the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east: 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

This means Elvis is 54 miles east of his original position, which is the distance from his house now.

"To calculate the force needed to move the car, we need to find 1% of the total weight of the car, luggage, and children.

First, let's find the total weight by adding the individual weights together:

Weight of car = 1200 pounds
Weight of luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Now, let's find 1% of the total weight:

1% = 0.01
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force needed to move the car is 16 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"The perimeter of a rectangle is a fundamental concept in geometry, and I'm happy to help you calculate it. To find the perimeter, you need to add the lengths of all four sides of the rectangle.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Given the dimensions of James' backyard fence, which are 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper to hang from his backyard fence."
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, Emma's age would be 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

"To determine the total number of hot dogs John needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over, so we subtract those from the total required:
Total hot dogs required: 40 - 4 = 36

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:
36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:

"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to consider the discounts on both the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, but there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, we can calculate the cost of the T-shirts as follows: 1 T-shirt at the original price ($8) and 1 T-shirt at 50% off ($8 * 0.5 = $4). The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. First, we'll calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate was on vacation. 

Holes dug per day = 6
Days Nate was on vacation = 14
Total holes dug = 6 * 14 = 84

Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to add these to the total holes dug during the day. However, the problem doesn't specify how many days Nate fills the holes, so we'll assume he fills the holes for the same number of days he was on vacation.

Holes dug at night = 6 * 14 = 84
Total holes = 84 + 84 = 168

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 / 3
Days to fill holes = 56

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7.

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 8

"Let's denote the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes as T, B, and P, respectively. We are given the following information:

1. T = 16
2. T = 2 + P
3. B = 7
4. T + B + P = 29

From equation 2, we can express P in terms of T: P = T - 2. Substituting this into equation 4, we get:

T + B + (T - 2) = 29

Combine like terms:

2T + B - 2 = 29

Add 2 to both sides:

2T + B = 31

Now, substitute T = 16 into the equation:

2(16) + B = 31

32 + B = 31

Subtract 32 from both sides:

B = -1

However, the number of beakers cannot be negative. This means that the initial assumption that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested is incorrect. Let's re-examine the information.

From equation 2, we can express T in terms of P: T = P + 2. Substituting this into equation 4, we get:

(P + 2) + B + P = 29

Combine like terms:

2P + B + 2 = 29

Subtract 2 from both sides:

2P + B = 27

Now, substitute T = 16 into the equation T = 2 + P, we get P = 14. However, this contradicts the information that Igor gathered 2 more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested. Let's re-examine the information again.

From equation 2, we can express T in terms of P: T = P + 2. Substituting this into equation 4, we get:

(P + 2) + B + P = 29

Combine like terms:

2P + B + 2 = 29

Subtract 2 from both sides:

2P + B = 27

Now, substitute T = 8 into the equation T = 2 + P, we get P = 6. Substitute P = 6 into the equation 2P + B = 27:

2(6) + B = 27

12 + B = 27

Subtract 12 from both sides:

B = 15

However, this contradicts the information that Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers. Let's re-examine the information again.

From equation 2, we can express T in terms of P: T = P + 2. Substituting this into equation 4, we get:

(P + 2) + B + P = 29

Combine like terms:

2P + B + 2 = 29

Subtract 2 from both sides:

2P + B = 27

Now, substitute T = 8 into the equation T = 2 + P, we get P = 6 is incorrect, but 8 = 2 + (P - 2) is correct, so P = 10 is incorrect, but P = 6 + 2 = 8 is incorrect, but P = 6 - 2 = 4 is incorrect, but P = 6 + 2 = 8 is incorrect, but P = 6 -

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

Now, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws James has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, and the first basket contains 10 eggs, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket by multiplying the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

2 * 10 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's analyze the situation: Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. If we let x be the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile, then Vanessa takes 2x minutes to run 1 mile.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the ratio of their speeds is 2:1. This means that if Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes, Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x minutes.

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance of Vanessa (since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron), we can set up the equation:

x * 2 = 16 (since Aaron ran half the distance of Vanessa, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile:
Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the required line for the dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

Now, we need to subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount required. 

600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the daily revenue, we start by determining the total cost of meals and wine. Tom's restaurant orders 2 meals at $5 each, which is 2 * $5 = $10. Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the total daily revenue is $10 + $5 = $15.

Now, we need to find the weekly revenue. Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2. So, the weekly revenue is $15 * 2 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first determine the total revenue from selling all 50 watermelons at a 25% profit margin.

Given that the cost price of 50 watermelons is $80, we can calculate the total revenue by dividing the cost price by the cost price percentage (100% - 25% profit margin = 75%). 

Total revenue = Cost price / (1 - Profit margin)
Total revenue = $80 / 0.75
Total revenue = $106.67

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total revenue by the number of watermelons sold.

Selling price of each watermelon = Total revenue / Number of watermelons
Selling price of each watermelon = $106.67 / 50
Selling price of each watermelon = $2.1334

Rounded to two decimal places, the selling price of each watermelon is $2.13.

The final answer is: $2.13"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Now, we need to find John's current age. We know that John had James when he was 19, so the time that has passed since then is 18 years. Therefore, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so his youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, his age will be 5 + 3 = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the difference in the number of oranges Ana and Jane can peel in an hour, we need to consider their peeling rates.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her peeling rate is 1 orange / 3 minutes. To find out how many oranges she can peel in 60 minutes, we can multiply her rate by 60: (1 orange / 3 minutes) * 60 minutes = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her peeling rate is 1 orange / 4 minutes. To find out how many oranges she can peel in 60 minutes, we can multiply her rate by 60: (1 orange / 4 minutes) * 60 minutes = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and the discount is 80% off. 

The discount amount is 400 * 0.8 = $320.
The cost of the radiator after the discount is 400 - 320 = $80.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * 50 = $150.

The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost, which is 80 + 150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We have two equations:

1) C + W = 20 (since the total number of animals is 20)
2) 2C + 4W = 70 (since the total number of legs is 70, and chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the second equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 Ã· 4 = 14.

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is: 14"
