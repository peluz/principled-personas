"To determine Janet's daily earnings from selling eggs at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she has left after consuming some for breakfast and baking muffins.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins, resulting in a total of 7 eggs used. 

To find the number of eggs left, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. Therefore, her daily earnings from selling eggs at the farmers' market are 9 * 2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber needed. The problem states that 2 bolts of blue fiber are required, and the amount of white fiber needed is half that of the blue fiber.

Since the amount of white fiber is half the amount of blue fiber, we can calculate it as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we can find the total number of bolts by adding the blue and white fiber together:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house was $80,000, and Josh invested $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%.

First, we calculate the increase in value due to the repairs:
Increase in value = Original value * 150%
Increase in value = $80,000 * 1.5
Increase in value = $120,000

Now, we add the increase in value to the original value to find the new value of the house:
New value = Original value + Increase in value
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Next, we calculate the total cost of the house, which is the sum of the original price and the repairs:
Total cost = Original price + Repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he covers in a single sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters. Therefore, the total distance he covers in a single session is the product of the number of sprints and the distance per sprint, which is 3 * 60 = 180 meters.

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total distance he covers in a week is the product of the distance per session and the number of sessions, which is 180 * 3 = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we must first calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon. 

The morning feed consists of 15 cups, and the afternoon feed consists of 25 cups. Therefore, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has a flock of 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

To find the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total cost of the glasses, we can use a geometric series formula. The first term (a) is $5, the common ratio (r) is 0.6, and the number of terms (n) is 16.

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where S is the sum of the series.

Plugging in the values, we get S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6).

"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we can start by identifying the number of sheep in each city. Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, we can use this as a reference point to calculate the number of sheep in the other two cities.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston by multiplying the number of sheep in Seattle by 4. This gives us 4 * 20 = 80 sheep in Charleston.

Next, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, we can calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse by multiplying the number of sheep in Charleston by 2, which gives us 2 * 80 = 160 sheep in Toulouse.

To find the total number of sheep in all three cities, we can add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To determine the total time it takes to download the file, we need to consider the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, we can find the time it takes to download 80 GB (40% of 200 GB) as follows:

Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Next, we need to account for the time it takes to install the updates, which is given as 20 minutes.

Now, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. The remaining 60% of the file is 120 GB (0.6 * 200 GB), and Carla can download 2 GB/minute. Therefore, the time it takes to download 120 GB is:

Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

To find the total time, we add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:

Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each segment of his trip and then subtract the total distance from the initial distance.

First, let's calculate the distance John traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Next, we need to calculate the distance John traveled in the return trip. He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so the distance traveled during this time is 0 miles.

Then, he drove for half an hour at 30 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

After that, he drove for the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

The total distance traveled in the return trip is the sum of the distances traveled during the two segments:

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 160 = 175 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance John traveled in the 4 hours:

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled in the first 3 hours + Total distance traveled in the return trip
Total distance traveled = 180 + 175
Total distance traveled = 355 miles

However, this is the total distance John traveled in the 4 hours, not the distance he is from home. Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$"
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked by her hourly rate: 40 * $10 = $400.

Eliza also receives overtime pay, which is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. Her overtime pay rate is therefore 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. Since she worked 45 hours in total and 40 of those hours are considered regular hours, the number of overtime hours is 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her earnings for the overtime hours are then 5 * $12 = $60.

To find her total earnings for the week, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours: $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find the reduction, we calculate 30% of 180, which is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To determine the total cost of the pastries Toula purchased, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum these costs.

First, we calculate the cost of the donuts. Since she bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, the total cost of the donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. With 2 dozen cupcakes at $80 per dozen, the total cost of the cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.

Lastly, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. With 6 dozen cheesecakes at $55 per dozen, the total cost of the cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together to find the total cost: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a revenue of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5 per year. Additionally, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year, resulting in a net revenue of $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

To find the number of years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we can divide the initial cost by the net revenue:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.5 (net revenue) = 12 years

However, this calculation represents the time it takes for the tree to pay for itself. Since the tree will start generating revenue in the first year, we can conclude that it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as ""x"".

At the green house, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3. This leaves her with 2x/3 vacuum cleaners.

After selling 2 more at the red house, she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of 2x/3 - 2 is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = x/3 - 1.

So, after selling at the orange house, she has 2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners left.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students. Then, 25% of these 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students to find the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the optimal purchase choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each option. 

The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, and the electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%. 

First, let's calculate the increase in value for each item:
- Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
- Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since the increase in value for the jewelry ($125) is greater than the increase in value for the electronic gadgets ($96), the merchant should choose the jewelry.

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125.

The final answer is: $125"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In this case, the two sides are the distances traveled by the train on the first and second days, which are 80 miles and 150 miles, respectively. We can use these values to calculate the total distance covered by each train.

Let's denote the total distance as 'd'. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

d^2 = 80^2 + 150^2
d^2 = 6400 + 22500
d^2 = 28900
d = √28900
d = 170

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles.

The final answer is: 170"
"To determine Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then sum them.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. Her hourly wage is $20, and she works 35 hours per week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, the total hours worked per year is 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year. Therefore, her annual earnings from teaching are 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. Her hourly wage is $30, and she works 15 hours per week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, the total hours worked per year is 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year. Therefore, her annual earnings from coaching are 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500.

To find her total annual salary, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in that time frame. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days. Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she will eat 3 eggs per day. Therefore, in 28 days, she will consume 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

To find the number of dozens of eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen. Thus, 84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the speed at which Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the hike. Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike, we can find the total time by dividing the total distance by her desired average speed.

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, so she has 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink, then subtract the amount of water lost when 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in the original mixture is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

When 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the amount of water lost is (2/3) * 1 = 2/3 = 0.67 liters.

The remaining amount of water is 15.67 - 0.67 = 15 liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. To find this, we need to calculate the amount of water in the 9 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 9 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9 = 3 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 9 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9 = 3.6 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 + 3 + 3.6 = 21.6 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.6}$"
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we first need to establish Raymond's current age. Given that Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before her, we can calculate Raymond's age as 31 - 6 = 25 years.

Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we can find the number of years that have passed since then by subtracting 23 from his current age: 25 - 23 = 2 years.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers.

The first 3 customers purchased one DVD each, resulting in a total of 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs sold.

The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, which amounts to 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs sold.

Since the last 3 customers did not purchase any DVDs, we do not need to account for them in our calculation.

Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total decrease in the candle's length, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we can start by calculating the total cost of the items she purchased, excluding the pizza boxes. The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 = $15, and the cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of pizza by dividing the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box, which is $8.50. 

Number of pizza boxes = $17 / $8.50 = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on clothing items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them together.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pants: 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

Lastly, we find the cost of the shoes: 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each is 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, we add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To determine the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the number of cartons she will purchase and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia consumes one serving of ice cream every night, she will require 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton contains 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide 60 by 15:
60 / 15 = 4

Therefore, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

We know that Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles.

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we can find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. Given that the less expensive pair costs $33, we know that H = 2 * 33 = $66.

We are also told that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. Let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We can express this relationship as an equation: B = 33 + 66 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $94."
"Let's denote Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a constant representing the ratio multiplier. Given that their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms, we get 18x = 162. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 18, yielding x = 9.

Now that we know the value of x, we can determine Allen's current age by substituting x into the expression for his age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

The final answer is: $\boxed{109}$"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and then divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans. The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one: 80 / 2 = 40, 40 + 20 = 60. The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: 80 * 0.25 = 20, 80 + 20 = 100.

The total number of guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. There are 3 people.

The average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

"To determine the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to calculate the daily time commitment and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

First, we calculate the daily time commitment by multiplying the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog. 

Number of dogs: 10
Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Daily time commitment = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Daily time commitment = 10 * 0.5
Daily time commitment = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the total weekly time commitment by multiplying the daily time commitment by 7.

Total weekly time commitment = Daily time commitment * 7
Total weekly time commitment = 5 * 7
Total weekly time commitment = 35 hours

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can write the equation S + G = 110. Additionally, we are given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, which can be expressed as G = S + 30.

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for S. Substituting G = S + 30 into S + G = 110 gives us S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 30 = 110. Subtracting 30 from both sides yields 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us S = 40.

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30. Therefore, G = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the number of jewels Siobhan has, we need to establish a sequence of relationships between the individuals involved.

First, we know that Raymond possesses 40 jewels. 

Next, we are informed that Aaron's jewels are 5 more than half of Raymond's jewels. To find half of Raymond's jewels, we divide 40 by 2, which equals 20. Therefore, Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Lastly, we are told that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Consequently, Siobhan's jewels can be calculated as 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which equals 1 point. Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

"To determine the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of yogurts he consumes during this period. Given that Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, the total number of yogurts can be calculated as follows:

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Since the yogurts are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets Terry purchases. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per set:

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set:

15 sets * $5.00/set = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is 8 * 20 = $160.

He also has $5 left, so the total amount of money he spent is 195 - 5 = $190.

Now, we subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount of money he made:
195 - 160 = $35

This means John spent $35 of his own money to buy the video games. Since he spent $35 of his own money, he must have used the remaining money from the Lego sales to buy the video games.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $35.
35 / 15 = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 11 sets with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours on the first day. For the remaining two days, he runs half as much, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day.

The total running time is the sum of the hours run on each day: 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours.

Since John runs 3 days a week, we multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time: 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours.

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour.

Therefore, John's running speed is 3.33 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking speed. Given that her skipping speed is half of her running speed and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, we can infer that her running speed is twice her skipping speed, which is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can calculate her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4. Therefore, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find the time she spends walking and running. It is stated that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Given that the total time is 6 hours, the time she spends walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours, and the time she spends running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while walking and running. The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

2. B = 2S (Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone)
3. Br = 4B (Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone)

Substituting the value of S from equation 1 into equation 2, we get:
B = 2(1) = 2

Now, substituting the value of B into equation 3, we get:
Br = 4(2) = 8

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

"To determine the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while still hitting it with the gold javelin, we need to consider the increased range provided by the sapphire gemstone.

When Polly holds the gemstone, her throwing distance triples. Therefore, the new range is 3 times the original 400 feet.

New throwing distance = 3 * 400 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the flames and still hit the dragon with the javelin.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests, we can calculate the total number of pieces initially available and then subtract the number of pieces remaining.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces: 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

Next, we subtract the number of remaining pieces: 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces.

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

"To determine the remaining daily calorie allowance, we first need to calculate the difference between the daily target and the calories already consumed. Given that the daily target is 2000 calories and 1800 calories have been consumed, the remaining allowance is 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips contains 250 calories, we can find the maximum number of servings that can be consumed within the remaining calorie allowance by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Now, we know that a 300g bag of chips contains 5 servings. To find the maximum weight of chips that can be consumed, we multiply the number of servings by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

Therefore, the maximum weight of chips that can be consumed is 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Since Charlie sells each candle for $2.00 and he makes and sells 20 candles, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 per pound * 2, which equals $20.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this value, we can multiply the number of articles written on Monday by 2/5 and add the result to the original number of articles. This gives us 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, we can find the total number of articles written in 3 days by adding the number of articles written each day: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package is the sum of the initial Post-it notes, the Post-it notes used, and the Post-it notes remaining.

We can express this as an equation:

80 + x - 220 + 23 = total Post-it notes after purchasing the package

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 23 = 80 + 220 - 23
x + 23 = 277 - 23
x + 23 = 254
x = 254 - 23
x = 231

"To determine the total amount spent on ties, we first need to calculate the number of blue ties and the cost of red ties.

Given that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost per tie: 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

The total cost of red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

To find the total amount spent on ties, we add the cost of blue ties and red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we first need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches, we can calculate the total length of the wire in inches as follows:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces obtained:

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we first calculate the total number of units by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor. Given that there are 15 floors and 8 units per floor, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units. To do this, we multiply the total number of units by 1/4, which is equivalent to multiplying by 0.25. Therefore, the number of unoccupied units is 120 * 0.25 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week. Given that his chickens produce 252 eggs per day, we can find the weekly production by multiplying this daily rate by 7.

Weekly egg production = 252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are typically sold in dozens, we must convert the total weekly production to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total weekly production by 12.

Weekly production in dozens = 1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, we can calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings by multiplying the number of dozens sold by the price per dozen. Given that he sells eggs for $2 per dozen, we have:

Weekly earnings = 147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To determine the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spent traveling back.

The distance from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours, and since Tom's ship can travel at a constant speed of 10 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance as 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

Using the formula distance = rate * time, we can rearrange it to find the time: time = distance / rate. Therefore, the time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour is 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Now, we need to find the time it took to travel back. The distance is the same, 30 miles, and Tom's ship can travel at a speed of 6 mph. Using the same formula, the time it took to travel back is 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

The total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove, we first calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Given that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the number of toys to be removed by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy, which is 1/2 pound. Therefore, the number of toys to be removed is 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the difference in revenue between the two days, we first need to calculate the total revenue earned on each day. 

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is calculated as 6 * $60 = $360, and the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires, with no truck tires being repaired. The revenue from car tires on Friday is 12 * $40 = $480.

Comparing the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday, we find that Thursday's revenue ($520) is greater than Friday's revenue ($480). 

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

"To determine the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to calculate the sum of the raspberries in the clusters and the individual raspberries.

First, we calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. Since there are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries in each cluster, we can find the total by multiplying the number of clusters by the number of raspberries per cluster: 6 * 20 = 120.

Next, we add the number of individual raspberries to the total number of raspberries in the clusters. There are 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush. Therefore, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The final answer is: 187"
"To determine the number of good oranges, we first need to calculate the number of unripe oranges. Given that 20% of the oranges are unripe, we can find this by multiplying the total number of oranges by the percentage of unripe oranges.

20% of 25 oranges = (20/100) * 25 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Next, we know that there is 1 bad orange. To find the total number of oranges that are not good, we add the number of unripe and bad oranges.

1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) = 6 oranges are not good.

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges.

25 (total) - 6 (not good) = 19 oranges are good.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider the pension structure. For the first 20 years, she receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000. After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

The value of the pension after 20 years is the fixed annual pension multiplied by the number of years, which is $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she receives 5% of the value of the pension, which is 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000/year.

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be the sum of the fixed pension for the first 20 years and the 5% pension for the remaining 10 years, which is $50,000/year + $50,000/year = $100,000/year.

The final answer is: $100,000."
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The streaming service charges Aleena $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months and the second half of the year also consists of 6 months.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount, which is 90% of the initial amount. This can be calculated as 0.9 * $140 = $126.

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To determine the distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. This can be done by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up by the amount of gas used. Given that Sophia has traveled 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas, we can calculate her mpg rating as follows:

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we have the car's mpg rating, we can find the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity by the mpg rating. The owner's manual states that the tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

total miles = tank capacity * mpg
total miles = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total miles = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"To determine the total time spent on TV and reading, we first need to calculate the daily time spent on these activities. 

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour. Therefore, the total time spent on TV and reading in one day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since this pattern is repeated 7 days a week, the total time spent on TV and reading in one week is 3 hours * 7 days = 21 hours.

To find the total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 21 hours * 4 = 84 hours.

"To determine the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year. 

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. This can be calculated as 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

For the rest of the year, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day. Since there are 365 days in a year, the number of days remaining in the year after the first 180 days is 365 - 180 = 185 days. Therefore, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is the sum of the amount eaten in the first 180 days and the amount eaten in the rest of the year, which is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relative amounts of laundry each person does. Let's start by determining the amount of laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can express this as a ratio: Sarah's laundry : David's laundry = 4 : 1.

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of laundry David does:

Sarah's laundry / David's laundry = 4 / 1
400 / David's laundry = 4 / 1

To solve for David's laundry, we can cross-multiply and divide:

David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Now that we know David does 100 pounds of laundry, we can find the amount of laundry Raymond does. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can express this as a ratio: Raymond's laundry : Sarah's laundry = 1 : 2.

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of laundry Raymond does:

Raymond's laundry / Sarah's laundry = 1 / 2
Raymond's laundry / 400 = 1 / 2

To solve for Raymond's laundry, we can cross-multiply and divide:

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

Now that we know the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we can find the difference:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100

"To determine the better price for buying flowers, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

"To determine the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the grooming is $100. The groomer offers a 30% discount for being a new customer. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal).

Discount amount = 0.3 * $100
= $30

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the cost after the discount.

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

Therefore, the cost of the grooming after the discount is $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find the amount of water left after the girls and the boy have taken their share, we first need to determine the total amount of water taken by the girls. Since each girl received 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate this as follows:

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they collectively received 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Next, we know that the boy received 6 liters of water. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy. 
Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

To find the amount of water left, we subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water. 
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

Next, we know that each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600.

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We are given two pieces of information: W = L + 8 and W + L = 22.

We can use the first equation to express W in terms of L, and then substitute this expression into the second equation. This will allow us to solve for L.

Substituting W = L + 8 into the second equation, we get (L + 8) + L = 22.

Combining like terms, we get 2L + 8 = 22.

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2L = 14.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get L = 7.

Now that we know L, we can find W by substituting L into the first equation: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, her initial salary increase will be 10% of $600, which is $60. Therefore, her salary after five years is $600 + ($60 * 5) = $900.

Now, we need to calculate her salary for the next three years. The annual increase will be 10% of her current salary. 

For the sixth year, the increase is 10% of $900, which is $90. Her salary after six years is $900 + $90 = $990.
For the seventh year, the increase is 10% of $990, which is $99. Her salary after seven years is $990 + $99 = $1089.
For the eighth year, the increase is 10% of $1089, which is $109.10. Her salary after eight years is $1089 + $109.10 = $1198.10.
For the ninth year, the increase is 10% of $1198.10, which is $119.81. Her salary after nine years is $1198.10 + $119.81 = $1317.91.

The final numerical answer is: $1317.91"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8000}$"
"To determine the total cost of the gift bags, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the guests do not show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

Let's start by finding 1/4 of 16, which is 4. Then, we subtract this value from the total number of guests.

16 - 4 = 12

Now that we know 12 guests will attend, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed. Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75.

12 * 0.75 = 9

Next, we need to find the total cost of the gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

9 * 2 = 18

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags for her party.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad required for the picnic, we need to calculate the amount consumed by both adults and children separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad eaten by adults. Since each adult consumes 10 pounds, and there are 20 adults, the total amount eaten by adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad eaten by children. Since children consume half as much as adults, and each adult consumes 10 pounds, each child consumes 10 / 2 = 5 pounds. With 5 children attending the picnic, the total amount eaten by children is 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts eaten by adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the total number of pets the three individuals have, we can start by establishing the number of pets each person owns. 

Given that Cindy has four pets, we can infer that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. Therefore, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Next, we are told that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Consequently, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we can sum the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To determine the age of Jackson, we can start by establishing the age of Corey, as we know that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. This implies that Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Next, we can use the information that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Now, we are given that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. This allows us to calculate Jackson's age as 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, the age of Jackson is 4 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find Gerald's new time, we first need to determine his original time. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can express Gerald's original time as Lee's time plus 2 seconds. Given that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's speed has improved by 10%, which can be calculated as 10% of his original time. This is equivalent to 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds. To find Gerald's new time, we subtract this improvement from his original time: 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

Therefore, Gerald's new time is 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we first need to establish the number of cats. Given that there are two cats for every dog and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as 2 * 60 = 120.

Next, we find the combined number of dogs and cats, which is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

Since the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, we can calculate the number of rabbits as 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the class. Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining fraction represents the girls. 

Total students = 200
Boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Girls = Total students - Boys = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we calculate the number of girls in the girl scout, which is 2/3 of the total number of girls.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we first need to calculate the number of hours James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of the hours Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can find James' hours by multiplying 9 by 2/3.

James' hours = (2/3) * 9
James' hours = 6

Now, we can find the difference in hours slept between Harry and James by subtracting James' hours from Harry's hours.

Difference = Harry's hours - James' hours
Difference = 9 - 6
Difference = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of tomatoes used by Freda, we first need to calculate the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be twice the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Given that each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can calculate the number of cans used by dividing the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can find the total number of tomatoes by multiplying the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can use the information provided. Let's denote the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. 

We know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. Since there were originally 30 cars on the motorway and 5 took an exit, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25. 

We can set up the equation: x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we first need to calculate the total number of potted plants she initially possesses. Since she has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home, the total number of potted plants is 2 * 40 = 80.

Subsequently, she received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, bringing the total to 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

However, she has decided to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family. Therefore, the number of potted plants she will give away is 40.

To find the number of potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants: 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of doorbell rings for each friend and then sum them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. 

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This can be calculated as 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he has to read. This can be done by summing the pages from each of his textbooks.

The total number of pages is given by the sum of the pages from the Science, Social Studies, History, and Geography textbooks: 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract this from the total to find the remaining number of pages.

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Now, we need to find the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day. This can be calculated by dividing the remaining number of pages by the number of days he has to complete his reading, which is 4.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

"To determine the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total time required to cover the city's width. Given that the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes, we can establish a rate of 3 miles per 10 minutes.

The city spans 42 miles from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge. To find the total time required, we can divide the total distance by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

42 miles / (3 miles / 10 minutes) = 42 miles * (10 minutes / 3 miles)

Using the order of operations, we first perform the division in the denominator, then the multiplication.

42 * 10 = 420
420 / 3 = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The final answer is: 140"
"To determine the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed, we first need to calculate the number of pieces placed by Poppy. A quarter of the total 1000 pieces is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

After Poppy places her portion, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces remaining.

Next, we calculate the number of pieces placed by Poppy's mom, which is a third of the remaining 750 pieces. This is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of pieces placed by her mom from the remaining pieces to find the number of pieces left to be placed: 750 - 250 = 500 pieces.

The final answer is: 500"

"To find the total inner volume of the three boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of each box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 1 inch from each side of the box's dimensions.

The original dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Subtracting 1 inch from each side, we get inner dimensions of 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying its inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has three boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume of all three boxes: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all three boxes is 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time spent watching TV and subtract the time spent watching other episodes.

Let's break down the time spent watching 1-hour episodes: 
- Monday and Tuesday: 2 * 1 = 2 hours
- Thursday: 1 hour
- Friday: 2 hours
Total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent watching TV: 7 hours.

The time spent watching 30-minute episodes can be found by subtracting the time spent watching 1-hour episodes from the total time: 7 - 5 = 2 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is 2 / 0.5 = 4.

However, this is not the only possible solution. We need to consider the time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Thursday as well. Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday as x. Then, the time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Wednesday and Thursday is 0.5x + 0.5.

We know that the total time spent watching 30-minute episodes is 2 hours. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 0.5x + 0.5 = 2.

Solving for x, we get: 
0.5x = 2 - 0.5
0.5x = 1.5
x = 1.5 / 0.5
x = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x. This year, he intended to bake twice as many cookies, so he baked 2x cookies. However, he accidentally baked 15 more cookies than intended, resulting in a total of 2x + 15 cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, Henry has a total of 110 cookies left. This can be represented by the equation 2x + 15 - 5 = 110. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation, yielding 2x = 100. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 50.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards and then subtract the cashback rewards.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the cashback reward per gallon is $0.20. 

The total cost of gas without rewards is calculated by multiplying the cost per gallon by the number of gallons purchased: 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00.

The total cashback rewards are calculated by multiplying the cashback reward per gallon by the number of gallons purchased: 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00.

Now, we subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

Therefore, the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00.

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each consumed. 

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so the total number of roll-ups she ate is 2 * 24 = 48. 

Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and divide by 2. The sum of the total roll-ups eaten is 48 + 42 = 90. 

Dividing the sum by 2 yields 90 / 2 = 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the amount of water the boat took on, we need to calculate the number of sets of 10 feet Julia rowed and then multiply it by the amount of water taken on per set.

First, let's find Julia's rowing rate in feet per second. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

Rowing rate = Total distance / Time taken
Rowing rate = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Rowing rate = 1.25 feet/second

Now, let's find the total distance rowed in 64 seconds:
Total distance = Rowing rate * Time taken
Total distance = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds
Total distance = 80 feet

Since we are interested in sets of 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10:
Number of sets = Total distance / 10
Number of sets = 80 feet / 10
Number of sets = 8 sets

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2:
Total water taken on = Number of sets * Water per set
Total water taken on = 8 sets * 2 liters/set
Total water taken on = 16 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to consider the number of lessons and the frequency of cleaning per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, each teaching 2 lessons per day. This results in a total of 4 * 2 = 8 lessons per day.

Given that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we can calculate the total number of cleanings by multiplying the number of lessons by the frequency of cleaning per lesson: 8 * 3 = 24.

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total number of flowers Ryan has in his garden, we need to consider the number of flowers he planted and the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, the total number of flowers he planted can be calculated by multiplying the number of flowers planted per day by the number of days: 2 flowers/day * 15 days = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted: 30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers.

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish a relationship between the number of photographs that Jamal's and Brittany's phones can hold, and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as 'x'. According to the problem, the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. This means that Brittany's phone can hold 50x photographs.

We are also given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the following equation:

1800 = 6(50x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

300 = 50x

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50 to isolate x:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since Sasha has 10 of these boards and each costs $10, the total cost is 10 * $10 = $100.

Next, we calculate the cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards. Sasha has 5 of these boards, and each costs $16, so the total cost is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is the sum of the costs of the two types of boards, which is $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's determine the new price of the lumber after the 50% price increase. The new price is 1.5 times the original price, so the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each, and the new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

With the new prices, we can calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber. The revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150, and the revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenues from the two types of boards, which is $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. 

The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20. 

We are given that the total amount of the mixture (sugar and water combined) is 120. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we can set up a proportion: (7/20) = x/120, where x is the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 7 * 120 = 20x. 

This simplifies to 840 = 20x. 

Dividing both sides by 20, we get x = 42.

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To determine the total amount John paid for the shoes, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all 3 children. 

First, we find the cost of the shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 = $120.

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the shoes is $360.

The final answer is: $360"
"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to calculate the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. Given that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, the initial total is 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.

The total number of vehicles at the port on the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the initial salaries of Adrien and Lylah. Let's assume Adrien's initial salary is A and Lylah's initial salary is 0.7A, since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's.

Given that Adrien's initial salary was $40000, we can set up the equation 0.7A = 28000. Solving for A, we get A = 40000 / 0.7 = 57142.86. However, since we are dealing with salaries, we can round this to the nearest dollar, which is $57143.

Now, we know that Adrien's initial salary was $40000 and Lylah's initial salary was $28000.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. To find his new salary, we calculate 40% of his old salary and add it to his old salary. 40% of $40000 is 0.4 * 40000 = 16000. So, Adrien's new salary is 40000 + 16000 = 56000.

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of her old salary. 40% of $28000 is 0.4 * 28000 = 11200. So, Lylah's new salary is 28000 + 11200 = 39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: 56000 + 39200 = 95200.

The final answer is: $95200"
"To determine the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we first need to calculate the weekly usage and then extrapolate it to a monthly basis.

Given that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week, and each pad contains 30 sheets, his weekly usage can be calculated as follows:

Weekly usage = 2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the monthly usage by multiplying the weekly usage by 4:

Monthly usage = 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"To determine the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael have, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

"To determine the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

Let's break down her sleep schedule:

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48

"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs at two different speeds: 10 miles per hour for 3 hours and 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. The formula for distance is given by the product of speed and time. Therefore, the distance covered at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours is:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Next, we need to find the remaining time after 3 hours. The total time Rosie has to run is 7 hours, so the remaining time is:

Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour:

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the already-stamped pile as x.

When Jennie stamps one-third of the letters needing stamps, she stamps 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters. This means that the number of letters needing stamps is reduced by 20, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 letters in the pile of letters needing stamps.

We are given that after Jennie stamps the letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Since she added 20 letters to this pile, the initial number of letters in the pile can be represented as x + 20 = 30.

Solving for x, we get x = 30 - 20 = 10.

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 'x' spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, bringing the total to 'x + 5'. After using 3 spoons, Julia had 'x + 5 - 3' spoons left. We are told that this total is equal to 12.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to calculate the sum of the chicken sausages and the fish sausages. 

Dylan purchased 38 chicken sausages. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, the number of fish sausages can be found by adding 6 to the number of chicken sausages: 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to calculate the number of friends each of them has and then sum these values.

Given that Lily made 50 friends, we can find the number of friends Amy has by adding 20 to Lily's total, as Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. Therefore, Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, we can find the total number of friends by adding the number of friends Lily and Amy have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the total amount of money Dillon will spend at the store, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's establish the cost of each item. The cost of each pepper is given as $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45. Furthermore, an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item. Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180. Dillon buys 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers is 20 * $15 = $300. Dillon also buys 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges together: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we first need to calculate the total time spent by doctors. This can be found by multiplying the number of patients by the average time per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is then the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Next, we calculate the total revenue for the hospital by multiplying the number of patients by the hourly rate charged to the patients, and then converting the result to hours.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour = 2000 * $200/hour = $400000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $400000 - $30000
Profit = $370000

The final answer is: $370000"
"To determine the number of elves left, we first need to calculate the number of elves that quit after being vomited on. Since a third of the elves quit, we can find this by dividing the total number of elves by 3.

60 / 3 = 20

This means that 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after being kicked by children. To find the number of elves left, we subtract these 10 elves from the previous total.

40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total expenditure for the two months, we need to calculate the expenditure in June first. Since Joseph's expenditure in June was $60 less than in May, we can find it by subtracting $60 from the May expenditure.

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = Expenditure in May - $60
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60
Expenditure in June = $440

Now, we can find the total expenditure by adding the expenditures in May and June.

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

The final answer is: $940"
"To determine the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred at the carnival, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, resulting in a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Similarly, Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, resulting in a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is the sum of Pam's rides and Fred's rides, which is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the total miles he walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can find the miles walked on Tuesday by multiplying 4 by 6.

4 * 6 = 24 miles walked on Tuesday.

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We can find the miles walked on Wednesday by subtracting the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total.

Total miles walked = 41
Miles walked on Monday = 4
Miles walked on Tuesday = 24

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles walked - (Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday)
= 41 - (4 + 24)
= 41 - 28
= 13

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the total amount Tom pays for car washes in a year, we need to calculate the monthly expenditure and then multiply it by 12.

Given that Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15, we can find the monthly expenditure by multiplying the number of car washes by the cost per car wash: 4 * $15 = $60.

Now, to find the total annual expenditure, we multiply the monthly expenditure by 12: $60 * 12 = $720.

The final answer is: $720"
"To determine the number of video games Bobby has, we first need to calculate the number of video games Brian has after losing 5. Initially, Brian has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Next, we need to find 3 times the number of video games Brian has. This is calculated as 3 * 15 = 45.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer video games than 3 times the number of video games Brian has, we subtract 5 from 45 to find the number of video games Bobby has. This is 45 - 5 = 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to find the number of unicorns residing in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the total 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = 27 / 3 = 9

Next, we need to find the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Given that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = 2/3 * 9 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we must first calculate the cost of the items, then add the delivery fee, and finally, include the tip.

The cost of the items can be calculated as follows:

- The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00.
- The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00.
- The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00.
- The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items. This can be calculated as 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00. Adding this to the total cost of the items gives us $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Finally, we need to add the $5.00 tip to the total cost with the delivery fee. This results in $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions in both tests.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test. Given that he completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour and had 8 hours to complete it, we can find the number of questions completed as follows:

Questions completed in the first test = 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

Next, we'll calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test. He completed the test at the same rate of 5 questions per hour, but this time he had 6 hours to complete it. 

Questions completed in the second test = 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Now, we can find the total number of questions Mark completed in both tests by adding the questions completed in each test.

Total questions completed = 40 questions + 30 questions = 70 questions

The total number of questions in both tests is 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we subtract the total questions completed from the total questions in both tests.

Questions left incomplete = 175 questions - 70 questions = 105 questions

The final answer is: 105"
"To determine the number of pink gumballs in the candy machine, we first need to calculate four times the number of blue gumballs. Given that there are 12 blue gumballs, we can find this by multiplying 12 by 4.

12 * 4 = 48

Now, we are told that there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs. Therefore, we can find the number of pink gumballs by adding 22 to the result of the previous calculation.

48 + 22 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to calculate the number of semi-automatic cars. Given that there are 20 available cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the sum of automatic and manual cars from the total.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationships between the number of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can express this as W = 2B. Additionally, we know that there are twice as many babies as queens, which can be represented as B = 2Q.

The total number of bees in the hive is given as 700, so we can write the equation W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Now, we can substitute B = 2Q into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we find that Q = 100.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this value to find B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, since W = 2B, we can calculate W = 2(200) = 400.

Therefore, the number of worker bees in the hive is 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours more each day. This brings his daily work hours to 8 hours (assuming he already works a standard 8-hour day).

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 8 hours/day * 7 days = 56 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 56 hours * $10/hour = $560.

The final answer is: $560"
"To determine the total cost of the items John purchased, we need to calculate the cost of the food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the food items. The cost of milk is $2 and the cost of eggs is $3. Therefore, the total cost of the food items is $2 + $3 = $5.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the non-food items. The cost of light bulbs is $3, the cost of cups is $3, and the cost of roach traps is $4. Therefore, the total cost of the non-food items is $3 + $3 + $4 = $10.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount. To do this, we multiply the cost of the non-food items by 0.1 (which is equivalent to 10%). Therefore, the tax amount is $10 * 0.1 = $1.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the non-food items to get the total cost of the non-food items with tax: $10 + $1 = $11.

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items with tax to get the total cost: $5 + $11 = $16.

The final answer is: $16"
"To determine Kim's weekly profit, we must first calculate his total expenses. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. With a total of 8 clients (3 current and 5 potential), the total number of bottles of bleach needed per week is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed per week is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of bleach per week is 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32, and the cost of cloths per week is 8 packs * $5/pack = $40. Therefore, the total expenses per week are $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Given that Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we first need to calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest. Given that there are 100 pineapples per hectare and John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year to find the total number of pineapples harvested within a year:

1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"

Now, we add the number of pieces in each set together: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The total number of LEGO pieces Johnny picks up is 2125."
"To determine the number of bees that Debra sees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, we need to break down the events step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. In the next 6 hours, half of these bees return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees. At this point, the total number of bees that have left the hive is 30, and 15 have returned, leaving 15 bees that have not returned yet.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. This results in 2 * 30 = 60 bees leaving the hive. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees. However, 15 of these bees had not returned yet, and 15 bees that left in the first 6 hours also had not returned yet. Therefore, the number of bees that have not returned yet is 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. This means that the 15 bees that left in the first 6 hours and had not returned yet return to the hive. Therefore, the number of bees that Debra sees return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of admission for an adult is $12 and for a child is $10. Since Brittany's mom purchased one of each, the total cost is the sum of these two amounts.

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Brittany's mom received $8 in change, so to find the total amount she gave the cashier, we add this to the total cost.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

"To determine the number of Facebook friends James has, we can establish a relationship between the number of friends each person has. Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as ""D"". 

Given that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express this as 3D = 12, where 12 is the number of friends Charlie has. To find the value of D, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

D = 12 / 3
D = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express this as 4D = 4 * 4 = 16.

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

"To determine the outcome of the race between Steve and Tim, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, as the speeds are given in feet per minute. We know that 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, so his distance in feet is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet. His speed is 440 feet per minute.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 15840 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 36 minutes

Tim's distance is 2 miles, so his distance in feet is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet. His speed is 264 feet per minute.

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

"To determine the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's consider the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has two tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. Therefore, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, we'll consider the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has three tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. Thus, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Lastly, we'll consider the unicycle tire. A unicycle has one tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. Therefore, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

Number of packs: 10
Cookies per pack: 6
Cost per cookie: $0.10

Total number of cookies: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies
Total cost: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is the difference between the $10 bill and the total cost of the cookies.

"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x represent the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it. 

Initially, Dave ate 14 french fries. The seagull then ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 french fries. This means that a total of 14 + 7 = 21 french fries were eaten at this point.

Next, three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries. This brings the total number of eaten fries to 21 + 9 = 30.

After the pigeons ate, 2/3 of the remaining fries were eaten by a raccoon. Let's denote the remaining fries as (x - 30), since 30 fries were eaten by the pigeons. The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).

The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30). We can simplify this to (1/3)(x - 30).

After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.

We can solve for x by first adding 1 to both sides: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.

Then, multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18.

Finally, add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

Kimo has three 1-hour classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. This results in 3 hours of classes per day for these days. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes. This results in 4 hours of classes per day for these days. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. Therefore, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we must first calculate the length of each type of baked good in inches and then convert the total length to feet.

Each roll is 4 inches long, so the total length of the 300 rolls is 300 * 4 = 1200 inches. The 120 chocolate croissants, each 6 inches long, contribute a total of 120 * 6 = 720 inches. Lastly, the 60 baguettes, each 24 inches long, add 60 * 24 = 1440 inches to the total.

Now, we can find the total length of the baked goods by adding the lengths of each type together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12, since there are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, the total length of the baked goods is 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we must first calculate the monthly consumption of each ape species and then multiply it by 2 to account for the 2-month period.

The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, while the gorillas need 400 bananas per month. The baboons, on the other hand, consume 100 bananas per month. 

To find the total monthly consumption, we add the bananas needed for each species: 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since we need to calculate the total for a 2-month period, we multiply the monthly consumption by 2: 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1400}$"
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards per run. Therefore, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering a distance of 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers for this part is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner. To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total amount Raphael spent on school supplies, we need to calculate the individual costs of the items he purchased and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the pens. Since he bought 4 pens at $1.5 each, the total cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks. With 2 notebooks at $4 each, the total cost of the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $8.

Lastly, we have the cost of the bond paper, which is $20.

Now, we add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

The total amount Raphael spent on school supplies is $34."
"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond, we need to consider the changes in the tadpole population. Initially, Finn observes 11 tadpoles. Subsequently, 6 tadpoles emerge from under a lily pad, increasing the total number of tadpoles he can see to 11 + 6 = 17. However, 2 of these tadpoles then hide under a rock, reducing the number of tadpoles Finn can see to 17 - 2 = 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we first need to calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday. Given that the tank had 7 feet more water on Tuesday than it did on Monday, and the initial depth on Monday was 17 feet, we can find the depth on Tuesday by adding 7 to 17.

17 + 7 = 24

Now, we need to find two thirds of the depth on Tuesday to determine the depth on Wednesday. To do this, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of fish each of them caught and then sum the results.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. The total number of fish caught by Anakin is the sum of these three quantities: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19.

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. He also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Additionally, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

The total number of fish caught by Locsin is the sum of these three quantities: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.

To find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin, we add the total number of fish caught by each of them: 19 + 13 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we can use a geometric progression formula to calculate the price increase every two months.

The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20, and the price increases by 20% every two months. This can be represented as a geometric progression with a common ratio of 1.2 (1 + 0.20).

The formula for the nth term of a geometric progression is given by:

an = a1 * r^(n-1)

where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.

In this case, we want to find the 18th term (since we're calculating the price every two months for 36 months), so we can plug in the values:

a1 = $20
r = 1.2
n = 18

an = $20 * (1.2)^(18-1)
= $20 * (1.2)^17
= $20 * 12.742077696
= $255.84155492

The final answer is: $255.84"
"To determine the total worth of the toys in the room, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them together.

First, we know that the cost of one action figure is $5. Given that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, the cost of the doll is 3 * $5 = $15.

Next, we calculate the total cost of each type of toy:
- The cost of 5 red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.
- The cost of 3 action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.
- The cost of 1 doll is $15.

Now, we can find the total worth of all the toys by adding the costs together: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the difference in cost between doing taxes oneself and hiring an accountant, we need to consider the income lost by doing the taxes oneself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

The income lost by doing the taxes oneself can be calculated by multiplying the number of hours of freelance work missed by the hourly wage. In this case, Jackie will miss 3 hours of work, and her hourly wage is $35. Therefore, the income lost is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

The cost of hiring the accountant is given as $90. To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income lost: $105 - $90 = $15.

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories and then subtract this amount from her budget.

The computer costs €1090, the scanner costs €157, the CD burner costs €74, and the printer costs €102. 

The total cost of the computer accessories is the sum of these individual costs: 
€1090 + €157 = €1247
€1247 + €74 = €1321
€1321 + €102 = €1423

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget of €1500:
€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"To determine the number of times Sandra must babysit to obtain the necessary eggs for her school fundraiser, we need to calculate the total number of eggs required and then divide that by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs needed. Since Sandra is making 15 Spanish flans and each flan requires 3 eggs, the total number of eggs needed is 3 * 15 = 45.

Next, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job, which is 9. Therefore, the number of times Sandra must babysit is 45 / 9 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which can be expressed as S = 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2, and the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be represented by the equation (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28. Simplifying this, we have 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation yields 3B = 24. Dividing both sides by 3, we find B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can determine Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B, which gives us S = 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jimmy has, we first need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel possesses. Given that Ethel has $8, we can calculate this as 2 * 8 = 16.

"To determine the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking habits. He walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is a total of 5 days. On the weekends, he walks 10 miles a day, which is a total of 2 days.

First, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Friday: 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.

Next, we calculate the total miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we must first calculate the individual costs of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, which is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we can find the total cost of each uniform by adding the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"To determine the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the number of legs for each group of invertebrates and then sum these values.

First, we calculate the number of legs for the spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs.

Next, we calculate the number of legs for the insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs.

Lastly, we calculate the number of legs for the rare mutant invertebrates: 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs.

Now, we sum the number of legs for each group: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The final answer is: 1210"
"To determine the total age of the four birds, we need to establish the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, and Sally Four.

Given that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, we can conclude that Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Since Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, we can calculate her age as 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so her age is 16 + 3 = 19 years.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

The final answer is: 51"
"To determine the total annual payment, we need to calculate the increased minimum payment for each debt and then sum these amounts. 

The increased minimum payment for the student loans is $300 * 1.5 = $450. For the credit card, it is $200 * 1.5 = $300. Lastly, the increased minimum payment for the mortgage is $500 * 1.5 = $750.

Now, we add up the increased minimum payments: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500.

To find the total annual payment, we multiply this sum by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To determine the total time it takes Billy to prepare the potatoes, we need to calculate the time spent peeling and cutting each potato and then multiply these values by the total number of potatoes.

The time it takes to peel one potato is 1.5 minutes. To find the time it takes to cut one potato, we convert 5 seconds to minutes: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes = 1/12 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total time spent peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes:

Time spent peeling all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Time spent cutting all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (1/12) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

The total time spent peeling and cutting all potatoes is the sum of these two values: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes.

The final answer is: 95"
"To determine the amount spent on lemons, we need to first calculate the total revenue generated from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's start by calculating the total revenue per gallon. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, the total revenue per gallon is:

20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

Given that they made a profit of $25, we can express the total revenue as:

Total revenue = Profit + Cost
Total revenue = $25 + Cost

Since they sell each gallon for $10, the number of gallons they sold is:

Number of gallons = Total revenue / $10

We can now express the number of gallons in terms of the total cost:

Number of gallons = ($25 + Cost) / $10

The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5, and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. Therefore, the cost of lemons per gallon is:

Cost of lemons per gallon = $5 - $2 = $3

The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:

Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 * (($25 + Cost) / $10)

However, we can simplify this expression by first finding the number of gallons in terms of the total cost. Since the total revenue is $10 times the number of gallons, and the total revenue is $25 plus the total cost, we can set up the equation:

$10 * Number of gallons - $5 * Number of gallons = $25

Simplifying the equation:

$5 * Number of gallons = $25
Number of gallons = $25 / $5
Number of gallons = 5

Now that we have the number of gallons, we can find the total cost of lemons:

Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 * 5
Total cost of lemons = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to find the total number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 participants in total and 80 of them are Japanese, we can calculate the number of Chinese participants as follows:

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the amount of money Zaid has left after his expenses and donations, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on rent: 1/4 of 6000 is 600. 

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: 1/3 of 6000 is 2000.

Now, we subtract these two amounts from his total income to find the remaining amount: 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400.

Zaid then donates half of this remaining amount to his favorite charity: 1/2 of 3400 is 1700.

After the donation, we subtract this amount from the previous total: 3400 - 1700 = 1700.

Next, we need to account for the money given to his daughter and wife: 200 + 700 = 900.

Finally, we subtract this amount from the remaining total to find the final amount Zaid has: 1700 - 900 = 800.

"To find the total number of crabs, we first need to determine the number of crabs each person has. 

Let's start by identifying the number of crabs Bo has, which is given as 40. 

Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can calculate Monic's crabs by subtracting 4 from Bo's total: 40 - 4 = 36.

Next, we find the number of crabs Rani has by adding 10 to Monic's total: 36 + 10 = 46.

Now, we can find the total number of crabs by adding the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner obtained. Given that the winner secured 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate this as follows:

3/4 * 80 = 60 votes

Since the total number of students who voted is 80, the number of votes the loser received can be found by subtracting the winner's votes from the total:

80 - 60 = 20

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the number of red roses that Fred must deliver to Sandra, we need to establish the relationship between the number of white carnations and the number of red roses. We are given that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x, and we know that 5x = 200.

To find 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We are given that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40.
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the given information algebraically. Let's denote Mark's current age as M and Jan's current age as J. We are given that Jan is 30 years old, so J = 30.

From the problem statement, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age can be represented as M + 2.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since two years have passed, we need to subtract 2 from both Mark's and Jan's ages to find their ages two years ago. Therefore, Mark's age two years ago is M - 2, and Jan's age two years ago is J - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28.

We can now set up an equation based on the given information: M - 2 = (1/2)(28) + 5. Solving for M, we get:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age: M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the time difference between the two teams, we need to calculate the total time for each team. 

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

However, I noticed that the total time for the less well-rounded team was miscalculated. The correct total time is 222 seconds. 

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 222 = -2 seconds. However, since time cannot be negative, this indicates that the less well-rounded team actually finished faster."
"To determine the likelihood of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, we need to consider the total number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) and 6 total outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Since the two events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% - 25% = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we first need to establish the number of apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, and her mother picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's contribution by dividing her mother's total by 2.

Jenna's apples = 20 / 2 = 10

Now that we know Jenna picked 10 apples, we can find the total number of apples picked by adding Jenna's contribution to her mother's total.

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mother's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we need to first calculate the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits. The hamsters are kept in 10 cages, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

The total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

The total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to consider the effect of the monthly interest rate over a period of 3 months. The initial amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $100 + $2 = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $102 + $2.04 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'.

The total cost of purchasing the bags is $20x, and the total cost of transporting them is $2x. Therefore, the total cost is $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x, as each bag is sold at $30.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. We can express this as an equation:
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we find:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"To determine the total cost of the outing, we must first calculate the expenses for the tickets, food, and rides. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, which is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost of the outing is the sum of the ticket, food, and ride costs: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since the three friends agreed to split the cost evenly, we divide the total cost by 3 to find the amount each friend paid: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is $34."
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the peaches collected per minute and the total minutes spent collecting.

John collects 2 peaches per minute. 
He collects for 3 hours. 
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes spent collecting is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the peaches collected per minute by the total minutes: 
2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

"To determine the daily insect consumption of a flock of ten ducks, we first need to calculate their total weekly insect consumption. Given that each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we can find the total weekly consumption by multiplying this value by the number of ducks.

Total weekly insect consumption = 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the daily insect consumption by dividing the total weekly consumption by 7.

Daily insect consumption = 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks requires 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to consider the net change in the number of trees over this period. 

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, resulting in a net increase of 8 trees per year. Over 10 years, this net increase amounts to 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees. Therefore, after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39.

Consequently, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To determine the difference between the number of pink and white plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard at noon on Sunday, we need to break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos. On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. These 6 flamingos were then painted white and put back out. This leaves 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. Therefore, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To determine the amount of change Violetta will receive after purchasing the crayons, we first need to calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since she wants 5 different colors and each crayon costs $2, she will need 2 crayons of each color. 

Total number of crayons = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons = 10

Total cost of crayons = Total number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 * $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

Since Violetta has $20 and the total cost of the crayons is also $20, we can calculate the change as follows:

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

"To determine the cost of a pen, we must first establish the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser, as the problem states that a pen costs as much as this combination. 

Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the combined cost as follows:
Combined cost = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Since a pen costs the same as this combined cost, we can now calculate the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of a single pen by 8:
Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the amount of carrots that will not be used, we need to calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed to the restaurants and then subtract that from the initial amount.

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, we can calculate the pounds of carrots that will not be used by subtracting the total pounds distributed from the initial amount:

Initial amount = 200 pounds
Total pounds distributed = 80 pounds
Pounds not used = Initial amount - Total pounds distributed = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of children in the city of Soda, we can calculate the difference between the total population and the sum of the male and female populations.

Given:
- Total population = 23786
- Number of men = 8417
- Number of women = 9092

First, we find the sum of the male and female populations:
8417 (men) + 9092 (women) = 17509

Next, we subtract this sum from the total population to find the number of children:
23786 (total population) - 17509 (sum of men and women) = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them to the initial number.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we need to consider the number of sentences he edits for each publisher and the respective payment rates.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as x. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we have x = 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount he earns from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, the total amount Mark earns from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we add the amounts earned from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7500}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he receives and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur receives 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. Therefore, the total number of pails he receives in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he receives every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To determine the total amount John made that year, we need to consider the one-time monetary reward of $5000 and the 5% raise in his salary.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise in his weekly salary. A 5% increase on $2000 is equivalent to 0.05 * 2000 = $100. Therefore, his new weekly salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Since John works every week of the year, which consists of 52 weeks, we can calculate his total earnings for the year by multiplying his new weekly salary by the number of weeks worked.

Total earnings = New weekly salary * Number of weeks
= $2100 * 52
= $109,200

The total amount John made that year is $109,200."
"To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced per year on Josie's 10-acre farm, we need to consider the production rate of each acre and the conversion rate from tons of grapes to barrels of wine.

Given that each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, we can calculate the total tons of grapes produced on the entire farm by multiplying the number of acres by the production rate per acre:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we need to convert the total tons of grapes to barrels of wine. Since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, we can multiply the total tons of grapes by the conversion rate:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's 10-acre farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and then sum them together.

First, let's consider the slices used for sandwiches. Since Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week, the number of days is 7. Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese. Therefore, the total slices used for sandwiches is 7 * 2 = 14.

Next, we'll calculate the slices used for omelets. Carl made omelets for 3 days, and each omelet used one more slice of cheese than a sandwich, which is 2 + 1 = 3 slices. Thus, the total slices used for omelets is 3 * 3 = 9.

Lastly, we need to consider the slices used for the macaroni and cheese dish. Carl used 8 slices of cheese for this dish.

Now, let's add the slices used for each meal together to find the total number of slices used:
Total slices = 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of blue and red pens she purchased and add them to her initial number of pens.

Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens. Therefore, she acquired 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

Similarly, Janet purchased 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens. Consequently, she acquired 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

The total number of new pens she bought is the sum of the blue and red pens, which is 54 + 12 = 66 pens.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, totaling 32 pens.

To find the current total, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to calculate the total score required for the semester. Given that she desires an average of 93 across six tests, we can find the total score by multiplying the desired average by the number of tests.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we calculate the total score of the first five tests by summing their individual scores.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows students to exclude the lowest score from the average each semester, we identify the lowest score among the first five tests, which is 71. We then subtract this score from the total score of the first five tests to find the total score of the remaining four tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed for the semester.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

The final answer is: $\boxed{291}$"
"To determine the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total distance covered during each period and then sum them up.

First, let's consider the initial four weeks where Michael rode his bike 5 times a week, covering a distance of 25 kilometers each time. The total distance covered during this period can be calculated as follows:

Distance = (25 kilometers/time) * (5 times/week) * (4 weeks)
= 25 * 5 * 4
= 500 kilometers

Next, we consider the subsequent three weeks where Michael rode his bike 2 times a week, covering a distance of 60 kilometers each time. The total distance covered during this period can be calculated as follows:

Distance = (60 kilometers/time) * (2 times/week) * (3 weeks)
= 60 * 2 * 3
= 360 kilometers

Now, we can find the total distance covered by adding the distances from both periods:

Total distance = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers
= 860 kilometers

The final answer is: 860"
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we must first calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, then sum these values.

The weight of the chocolate bars can be found by multiplying the number of chocolate bars by their individual weight: 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

The weight of the candied apples is then calculated by multiplying the number of candied apples by their individual weight: 80 * 20g = 1600g.

The total weight of the bag of candy is the sum of the weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose purchased, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and sum them together.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes. 

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"To find the cost of each cup, we first need to determine the total cost of twenty dozen cups. We are given that this cost is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is sold at $6000 each. 

The total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000. 

Now, we subtract $1200 from this total to find the cost of twenty dozen cups: $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"To determine the number of times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2, as Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the local park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l represents the length and w represents the width.

Given that the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now that we have the total distance Gary walks, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. Therefore, the time he spends walking is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can start by identifying the number of customers she counted on the first day, which is given as 100. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is 100 + 50 = 150.

Now, we are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we can subtract the total customers on the first and second days from the total by the third day.

Let's calculate the number of customers on the third day:
Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is 2x gallons.

The rate at which the water is leaking from both pools is 4 gallons/minute. Since 4 minutes have passed, the total amount of water leaked from both pools is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 gallons (since 4 gallons leaked out). The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 4 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of hours Lori must work to afford the desired items, we first need to calculate the total cost of the purchase. This involves adding the cost of the shoes and the belt.

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Next, we divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find the number of hours she must work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

Therefore, Lori must work 44 hours to earn enough money to purchase the shoes and the belt.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in monthly installments and then subtract that from the total amount she owes, including the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:
$165/month * 12 months = $1980

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth owes, including the additional 10% interest:
Initial amount borrowed: $2000
Additional 10% interest: $2000 * 0.10 = $200
Total amount owed: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, we can calculate the remaining balance:
Total amount owed: $2200
Amount paid in 12 months: $1980
Remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220

The final answer is: $220"

"To find the average age of the three individuals in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then calculate their ages after three years.

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, we can use this information to find the ages of the other two individuals. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Furthermore, Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three individuals: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

"To determine the number of points Jojo scored, we can start by identifying the points scored by each of the other three students. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. To find half of Naomi's points, we divide 68 by 2, which equals 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. 

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the total points scored by the other three students from the overall total: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To determine the probability of selecting a water-type Pokémon card from James' collection, we need to calculate the proportion of water-type cards to the total number of cards.

Initially, James has 30 fire-type, 20 grass-type, and 40 water-type cards. 

Total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90

However, James loses 8 water-type cards and buys 14 grass-type cards. This results in the following adjustments:

- Water-type cards = 40 - 8 = 32
- Grass-type cards = 20 + 14 = 34
- Total cards = 90 - 8 + 14 = 96

Now, we can calculate the probability of selecting a water-type card:
Probability = (Number of water-type cards / Total number of cards)
= 32 / 96
= 0.333333...

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
Probability = 0.333333... * 100
= 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability is 33.

"To determine the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months. Given that 30% of the initial 120 watermelons were ready, we can find this by multiplying 0.3 by 120, which equals 36 watermelons.

Next, we calculate the number of watermelons remaining after two months by subtracting the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the initial total: 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Then, we determine the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we multiply 0.75 by 84, resulting in 63 watermelons.

Finally, to find the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the remaining watermelons: 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

"To determine the total cost of the fleet of cars, we must first calculate the total cost of the vehicles, the tax on the cars, and the registration fee.

The total cost of the cars can be found by multiplying the number of cars by the cost per car: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars, which is 10% of the total cost of the cars. This can be expressed as 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fee for each car is $1000, so the total registration fee for the fleet is 12 cars * $1000 per car = $12,000.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fee: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"To determine the number of penguins still sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that left the sunbathing area. 

One-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean, which is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. 
Another one-third of the penguins went inside the cave to eat their dinner, also 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

In total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the sunbathing area.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 
36 - 24 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend, we first need to calculate their combined weekly tomato consumption. 

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats half as much, which is 3 tomatoes per day. Therefore, their combined daily consumption is 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find their weekly consumption, we multiply their daily consumption by 7: 
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can find the number of vines needed by dividing their combined weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes per vine: 
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we must first calculate the total number of slices required to ensure each of the 20 friends receives 4 slices. This can be done by multiplying the number of friends by the number of slices per friend.

Total number of friends: 20
Number of slices per friend: 4
Total number of slices required: 20 * 4 = 80

Since pizzas are sold in slices of 8, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza to find the minimum number of pizzas needed.

Number of slices per pizza: 8
Number of pizzas required: 80 / 8 = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends receives 4 slices."
"To determine the total number of pens Ram gets, we need to consider the process of refilling pens with ink from empty ones. 

When Ram buys 25 pens, he can use the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. This means that the 25 pens he buys initially can be used to make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens. 

After using the ink from the first 25 pens, he will have 5 empty pens left. These 5 empty pens can be used to make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen.

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets is the sum of the initial 25 pens and the 6 new pens he can make from the ink of the 25 pens he bought and the 5 empty pens. This gives us a total of 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 pens.

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, Johnny starts with an initial allowance of $20. He then adds an additional $10 to this amount, resulting in a total of $30.

Next, we are told that this sum of $30 triples in value over the course of a year. To find the final amount, we can multiply $30 by 3.

$30 * 3 = $90

Therefore, after a year, Johnny has a total of $90."
"To determine the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to establish their individual ages. 

Given that Jessa is 20 years old, we can deduce the ages of the other two girls by applying the given age differences. 

Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Similarly, Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now, we can calculate the sum of their ages by adding their individual ages: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we can break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 1000 students in the hall.

First, 30% of the students exit through exit A:
30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students exit through exit A.
The remaining students are 1000 - 300 = 700.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students exit through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students exit through exit B.
The remaining students are 700 - 420 = 280.

Therefore, the number of students who exit through exit C is 280.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationships between the number of candies each person has. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as R, the number of candies James has as J, and the number of candies John has as H.

We are given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so we can express this as H = 2R. We are also given that John has 54 candies, so we can substitute this value into the equation to get 54 = 2R. Solving for R, we find that R = 27.

We are also given that James has 6 more candies than Robert, so we can express this as J = R + 6. Substituting the value of R we found earlier, we get J = 27 + 6, which simplifies to J = 33.

To find the difference in the number of candies between John and James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: H - J = 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora, we need to consider the number of books each person reads. Dolly has two books and will read her own two books and Pandora's one book, resulting in a total of 3 books read by Dolly.

Pandora, on the other hand, has one book and will read her own one book and Dolly's two books, totaling 3 books read by Pandora.

Therefore, the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora is 3 (read by Dolly) + 3 (read by Pandora) = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total time Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find the total number of letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total minutes.

First, let's calculate the total minutes used for his daily calls. Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes used for daily calls is 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.

Additionally, Jason has 300 extra minutes of calls this month. Therefore, the total minutes used is the sum of the minutes used for daily calls and the extra minutes: 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

Now, we can find the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan by subtracting the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan: 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of steps.

Let's denote the initial number of fries Griffin had as G, the number of fries Kyle took as K, the number of fries Billy took as B, the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x, and the number of fries Colby took as C.

We are given the following information:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries, so G = 24.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so K = 5.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so B = 2K = 2(5) = 10.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, so C = K - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2.
5. After all these transactions, Griffin had 27 fries.

We can express the final number of fries Griffin had as G - K - B + x - C = 27. Substituting the known values, we get 24 - 5 - 10 + x - 2 = 27.

Simplifying the equation, we get 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

7 = x

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the makeup services, we first need to calculate the daily cost, then multiply it by the number of days worked per week, and finally multiply that by the number of weeks.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works 6 hours a day. Therefore, the daily cost is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since the makeup artist works 4 days a week, the weekly cost is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie production lasts for 5 weeks, so the total cost for the makeup services is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After completing the movie, the makeup artist offers a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000.

To find the final amount Jean paid, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the amount each person paid for the party supplies, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party. This involves summing the costs of the cake, birthday presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, there are 3 people in total. To find the amount each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 / 3 = $32

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"To determine the total cost of the onions, we first need to calculate the total weight of the onions purchased. The chef bought 4 bags, each weighing 50 pounds. 

Total weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Next, we need to find the total cost by multiplying the total weight by the cost per pound of onions, which is $1.50.

Total cost = Total weight * Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Given that her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, Sue must have eaten 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, Sue must have eaten 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies eaten by each of them. Sue ate a total of 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies, while her sister ate 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

The number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30.

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33.

The number of boys in the third class is 30 - 33 = -3. However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of students.

Given the information provided, the correct answer is not directly calculable due to the inconsistency in the data."

"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed last night and today.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46.
The total number of cougars killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

Next, we add 6 to the result:
12 + 6 = 18

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we can find this by calculating 30% of 30 and subtracting it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, we can find the number of times Robert went down the slide by multiplying the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

21 * 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to calculate the number of cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

Number of cows added to each stall = Total cows bought / Number of stalls
= 40 / 10
= 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 * 8
= 192

The final answer is: $\boxed{192}$"

"To determine the total weight of the redwood, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. Given that the redwood is 200 feet tall, we divide 200 by 10 to find the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by multiplying the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites have eaten 30% of the wood, so we must subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. To calculate 30% of 8000, we multiply 0.3 by 8000, which equals 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

The final weight of the redwood is 5600 pounds."
"To determine the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is calculated by multiplying the number of books by the cost per book: 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

In addition to the cost of the overdue books, there is a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.

To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we add the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have. Let's denote the number of apples that Jamal has as 'J'. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, the number of apples Andrea has can be expressed as J + 8.

We are given that Andrea has 52 apples. Therefore, we can set up the equation J + 8 = 52 to find the value of J. Solving for J, we get J = 52 - 8 = 44.

Next, we are told that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. This means the number of bananas Jamal has is J + 4. Substituting the value of J, we get 44 + 4 = 48 bananas for Jamal.

We are also given that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. Therefore, the number of bananas Andrea has is (1/2) * 48 = 24.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she is making. She is baking 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are required to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. To do this, we can divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find the number of dozens: 66 / 12 = 5.5.

Now, we can convert 5.5 dozens into a more manageable form. We can express 5.5 dozens as 5 dozen and 6 cookies. Since 6 cookies is half of a dozen, we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Next, we need to calculate the flour required for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. Since 5 dozen cookies require 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour, we can add this to the 1 cup needed for the remaining 6 cookies.

Therefore, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can start by calculating two thirds of the total number of pennies. 

The total number of pennies is 9,300. To find two thirds of this amount, we can multiply 9,300 by 2/3.

9,300 * (2/3) = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"To determine the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to calculate the initial number of marbles she possesses and then add the marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison has 5 boxes, each containing 50 marbles. Therefore, the initial number of marbles can be calculated as the product of the number of boxes and the number of marbles in each box: 5 * 50 = 250.

Subsequently, Maddison receives 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, we add the initial number of marbles to the marbles she received: 250 + 20 = 270.

Therefore, Maddison now has a total of 270 marbles.

"To determine the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we first need to establish the number of trees in each yard.

Chris has 6 trees. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, we can calculate Ferdinand's trees as 6 / 2 = 3.

Next, we calculate the number of trees in Harry's yard. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. Adding 5 to this gives us 6 + 5 = 11 trees in Harry's yard.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to calculate the individual amounts and then sum them up.

Carmen's amount is given as $100. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha's amount is $100 + $25 = $125. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy's amount is $125 + $50 = $175.

"To determine the total cost of the house, we need to consider the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. The selling price of the house is $350,000. 

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which can be calculated as 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500. 

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which can be calculated as 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find the difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000, we subtract the budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to consider the various expenses associated with the transaction. 

First, we calculate the transfer fees, which amount to 3% of the selling price. This can be computed as 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000. 

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price. This can be computed as 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

The total fees paid by Mr. Tan are the sum of the transfer fees and the brokerage fee, which is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, we subtract the total fees from the selling price to obtain the net selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount of $250,000 from the net selling price to determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To determine the total time required to cook the chicken, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to the desired temperature and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, we need to find the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Since it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, we must calculate 40% of 20 minutes to determine the additional time required to reach 400 degrees. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. Therefore, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook the chicken. It is given that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees, it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it takes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees, and the time it takes to cook the chicken. Therefore, the total time is 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes.

First, we add the costs of these items together:
$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65
$13.65 + $1.35 = $14.00

Now that we have the total cost, we can find the change by subtracting this amount from the $20 the mother paid:
$20 - $14.00 = $6.00

Therefore, the cashier should give the mother $6.00 in change."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

Therefore, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{315}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the cost of the tomato seeds. Since she bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 per packet, the total cost of the tomato seeds is 20 * $40 = $800.

Next, we calculate the cost of the celery seeds. With 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 per packet, the total cost of the celery seeds is 80 * $30 = $2400.

Now, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the total amount of money spent on seeds. The total cost is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of these lines are Sean's, we can find his lines by dividing the total lines by 3: 108 / 3 = 36.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, which can be calculated as (4/5) * 60 = 48.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we can start by determining the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C. 

First, we calculate the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes. 

Next, we calculate the time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small holes and large holes together: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can start by considering their current ages. Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as m. We are given that the sum of their ages is 20, which can be expressed as M + m = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10). 

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: (M + m) + 20. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute this value into the expression to get 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

The cost of the popsicles can be found by multiplying the number of popsicles by the cost per popsicle: 20 * $0.25 = $5.

Similarly, the cost of the ice cream bars is calculated by multiplying the number of ice cream bars by the cost per ice cream bar: 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we can multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra. Given that there are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots, the total number of spots on the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we can find the number of spots per mamba by dividing the number of spots per cobra by 2. Therefore, each mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we can find the total number of spots on the mambas by multiplying the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba. Given that there are 60 mambas, the total number of spots on the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

To find the total number of spots on both the cobras and the mambas, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the total amount Maddy will spend on pizzas, we first need to calculate the total number of people she needs to buy for. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces between the gemstones.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we need to find the total length of the space between the gemstones. 

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

Now, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: 25 - 8 = 17 inches. However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: 1.75 / (1/4) = 1.75 / 0.25 = 7.

Therefore, Katerina uses 7 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we first need to calculate the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week. Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories.

The total number of stories written in the first week is the sum of the individual counts: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. This means Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

The total number of stories written in the second week is the sum of the individual counts: 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week: 120 + 240 = 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we first need to establish his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his current age by multiplying Ann's age by 2.

The brother's current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

To find his age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age.

The brother's age in 3 years will be 18 + 3 = 21 years.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left after purchasing a can of pop, we first need to calculate the total value of her initial funds. 

Kelly possesses 5 quarters, each worth 25 cents, and 2 dimes, each worth 10 cents. The total value of her quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents, and the total value of her dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents. 

Combining these values, Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from Kelly's initial amount. 

145 - 55 = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of rows of 5-star rows on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of trucks required to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is the product of the number of flagstones and the weight of each flagstone.

The total weight of the flagstones is 80 * 75 = 6000 pounds.

Next, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks, which is 2000 pounds per truck. This gives us 6000 / 2000 = 3.

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we first need to establish the speed of the car in the slow lane. Given that it is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, and the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, the car in the slow lane's speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane. The distance covered by both cars is the same, which is 480 miles. Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is:

time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We are given that A = 22 and I = A - 5. 

Substituting the value of A into the equation for I, we get I = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

We are also given that the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. Then, we can write the equation as T = 10(A + I).

Substituting the values of A and I into the equation, we get T = 10(39) = 390.

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: $\boxed{390}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we calculate the number of chocolate bars given to the adults. Each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars for the children are then 40 - 24 = 16.

To find out how many chocolate bars each child will receive, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Susan's earnings for the online task, we need to calculate the total time she spends working and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a 3-hour period. However, she takes a half-hour break in between, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the total points of the three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 21 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82.

The final answer is: $\boxed{82}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of oranges washed by the two sons and then subtract that from the initial number of oranges purchased.

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 
He washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges purchased: 
15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total count of activities Darren performed in two days, we need to calculate the number of activities for each day and add them together.

On the first day, Darren performed 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

The total number of activities for the first day is the sum of these three values: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170.

On the second day, Darren performed 20 more pushups than on the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He also performed 10 fewer squats, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats. Additionally, he doubled the number of dumbbell presses, resulting in 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

The total number of activities for the second day is the sum of these three values: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200.

To find the total count of activities in two days, we add the total number of activities for each day: 170 + 200 = 370.

The final answer is: 370"
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person in the household consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). Therefore, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we can find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last by dividing the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

To convert this to weeks, we divide the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and then subtract that from his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

The target for the week is 120 crates. To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target.

Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"To determine the total cost of the desk, we need to calculate the sum of the bids made by the 3 other people and Carmen. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, we can consider this a sequence of arithmetic terms.

The initial bid is $200, and there are 3 bids made by the other people, followed by 3 bids made by Carmen. This results in a total of 6 bids. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 200, d = 50, and n = 6. Plugging in these values, we get:
S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

The final answer is: $1950"
"To determine the total cost of the driving service for John, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total driving cost, and the total bonus.

First, we calculate the total miles driven. Since John commutes to work and back each day, the daily mileage is twice the distance to work, which is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. 

Next, we calculate the total miles driven per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. Then, we calculate the total miles driven per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

The driving cost is $2 per mile, so the total driving cost per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus per year, we multiply this by 12: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per year by adding the total driving cost and the total bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final numerical answer is: $31800"
"To determine the amount of time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we must first calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. The combined time for these two days is the sum of their individual exercise times.

Combined time = 16 minutes (Monday) + 23 minutes (Sunday) = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we can find this by multiplying the combined time by 2.

Twice the combined time = 2 * 39 minutes = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we can analyze the folding process and the resulting page arrangement.

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper. In a 32-page tabloid, the pages are arranged in a specific manner:

- The first page is on the left back, and the second page is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back, and the 31st page is on the right front.
- This pattern continues, alternating between the left and right sides.

Considering the symmetry of the arrangement, we can divide the 32 pages into two equal halves: the first 16 pages and the last 16 pages. Each half will require a separate piece of paper, as they are printed on opposite sides of the folded paper.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we first need to calculate the total amount she spent at the town fair. 

Annika initially had $50. She spent half of this amount on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. Additionally, she spent $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

To find the amount of money left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first calculate the number of books she sold in the second year. We know that she has sold a total of 250 books over three years, with 50 books remaining unsold. Additionally, we are given that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year.

Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as x. Then, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x. We can now set up an equation to find the number of books sold in the second year:

Total books = Books sold in the first year + Books sold in the second year + Books sold in the current year + Unsold books
250 = 2x + Books sold in the second year + x + 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:
250 = 3x + Books sold in the second year + 50

We are also given that the number of books sold in the current year (x) is 45. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:
250 = 3(45) + Books sold in the second year + 50
250 = 135 + Books sold in the second year + 50
250 = 185 + Books sold in the second year

Now, we can solve for the number of books sold in the second year:
Books sold in the second year = 250 - 185
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To determine Watson's total earnings for the month of April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week. Since Watson works a 10-hour shift each day and works 5 days a week, his total hours worked in a week are:
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Given that Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Additionally, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Since April has 4 weeks, Watson's total earnings for the month are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the number of people John lost to in the arm wrestling competition, we need to calculate the percentage of opponents he did not beat. Since he beat 80% of the people, the remaining percentage of people he lost to is 100% - 80% = 20%.

Now, we can find the number of people John lost to by multiplying the total number of opponents (20) by the percentage he lost to (20% or 0.2).

Number of people John lost to = 20 * 0.2 = 4

Therefore, the correct answer is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we first need to calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we can find this by multiplying the total number of loaves produced by two-thirds.

The total number of loaves produced is 60. Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. This is done by subtracting the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves produced: 60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Next, we need to determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon. Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we can find this by multiplying the remaining loaves by one-half.

Half of 20 is 20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. 

First, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we need to multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds by 4.

"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the tubs of ice cream. The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $13 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $11 = $22. Therefore, the savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

Next, let's consider the packets of milk. The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 * $1 = $4. The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 * ($1 - $0.5) = 4 * $0.5 = $2. Consequently, the savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk, which is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after 15 days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the extra arms. Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we can find the number of extra arms by dividing the total number of days (15) by the interval at which the arms grow (3). This gives us 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Next, we'll calculate the number of extra legs. The person grows an extra leg every 5 days, so we divide the total number of days (15) by the interval at which the legs grow (5), resulting in 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

Now, we can find the total number of new limbs by adding the number of extra arms and legs together: 5 + 3 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses he has incurred so far.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits at $100 each amounts to 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each amounts to 3 * $50 = $150.

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times this amount is 5 * $100 = $500. Therefore, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of these expenses: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

To find out how much Theo has left, we subtract the total cost from his initial budget: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost) = $4050.

However, Theo wants to save $2000 for this trip. Therefore, we subtract the amount he wants to save from his remaining budget: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

Since he wants to save $2000, he has $2050 - $2000 = $50 left over, which he can spend on gifts.

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by 7.

There are 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day, resulting in a total of 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day. 

The remaining family members are 5 - 3 = 2, and they consume 2 eggs each day, totaling 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Combining these amounts, the family consumes 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To determine Trent's age, we first need to establish the age of Jane. Given that Quinn is 30 years old and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age as 30 - 3 = 27.

Now, since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age: 27 + 5 = 32.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the current age of Noah. Since Cera is 46 years old now and six years ago she was half as old as Noah, we can determine Noah's current age by doubling Cera's age six years ago. This gives us 40 years as Noah's current age.

Now, we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

We are also told that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. This implies that the current population of Chile is twice the population six years ago. Thus, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120000}$"
"To find the number of players on the defense, we can denote the number of players on the defense as D. Given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

Additionally, the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, which is D/2.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

Since the total number of players is 105, we can set up the equation:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the number of people attending Martha's party, we first need to calculate the total number of people invited. There are 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people.

The total number of people from the 2 families with 6 people is 2 * 6 = 12. 
The total number of people from the 3 families with 4 people is 3 * 4 = 12.

Therefore, the total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't attend due to illness. This leaves us with 24 - 8 = 16 people.

Additionally, 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't attend due to illness had previous commitments. Since 1/4 of 8 is 2, we subtract these 2 people from the remaining 16.

Thus, the number of people attending Martha's party is 16 - 2 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we must first calculate the total number of marbles. Initially, the store had 50 marbles. Solomon then purchased 20 marbles from Johanna, bringing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

Next, we need to account for the marbles given by Solomon's father. His father provided 2/5 times the number of marbles Solomon bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, his father gave him (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, we can calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store by adding the marbles his father gave him to the initial total: 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2 kilograms. To find the total weight of the marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156 kilograms.

The final answer is: 156"
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we must first calculate its volume. The pool is a rectangular prism, and its volume can be calculated using the formula: Volume = Length x Width x Height.

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

We can now calculate the volume:
Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Next, we need to find the total cost to fill the pool. The cost per cubic foot is $0.1. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we need to establish the number of girls, nongendered children, and then sum these values with the number of boys.

Given that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls can be calculated as follows:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Furthermore, the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, which can be calculated as:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we sum the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To determine the total number of electric poles required to supply electricity in the neighborhood, we can utilize the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This ratio indicates that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are necessary.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can establish an equation to solve for the number of electric poles. Let's denote the number of electric poles as x. Consequently, the number of electric wires is 3x.

We can set up the equation 3x = 45 to represent the relationship between the number of electric poles and wires. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of women left at the party after 1/4 of the total number of people left.

Let's start by finding the total number of people who left. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate this as 1/4 * 40 = 10.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total. We are also given that 22 men stayed at the party, which means 25 - 22 = 3 men left. Since 10 people left in total, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women at the party. To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women: 15 - 7 = 8.

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the cost of the pen, we first need to establish the cost of the magazine. Given that the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, we can calculate the magazine's cost as follows:

Magazine cost = Book cost / 2
Magazine cost = $4 / 2
Magazine cost = $2

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the magazine's cost.

Pen cost = Magazine cost - $1
Pen cost = $2 - $1
Pen cost = $1

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we first need to find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can express this as an equation:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. Solving for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the weakening of the iced coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's analyze the impact of the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and we want to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Assuming the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes needed as follows:

Temperature difference = 65 degrees
Temperature decrease per ice cube = 13 degrees

Number of ice cubes = Temperature difference / Temperature decrease per ice cube
= 65 / 13
= 5

Now, we know that each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening caused by the ice cubes is:

Weakening due to ice cubes = Number of ice cubes * Weakening per ice cube
= 5 * 12
= 60 milliliters

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid also weakens the coffee, the total weakening caused by the cream is:

Weakening due to cream = 15 milliliters

To find the total weakening of the coffee, we add the weakening caused by the ice cubes and the cream:

Total weakening = Weakening due to ice cubes + Weakening due to cream
= 60 + 15
= 75 milliliters

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the ratio of old records to new records. The given information states that 2 old records are traded for 1 new record. This implies a ratio of 2:1, where 2 old records are equivalent to 1 new record.

Given that 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records between them, we can use the ratio to find the total number of old records traded. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is twice the number of new records.

Number of new records = 7
Number of old records traded = 2 * Number of new records
Number of old records traded = 2 * 7
Number of old records traded = 14

Since there are 5 people, and they all brought in the same number of old records, we can divide the total number of old records traded by 5 to find out how many old records each person brought in. However, this step is unnecessary for determining the total number of old records brought in.

The total number of old records brought in is equal to the number of old records traded, which is 14.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
= 2/5 * 100
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is the remaining employees:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

The salary of senior programmers is $400 more than that of junior programmers:

Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Finally, we can find the total amount paid to all programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can break down the events in a step-by-step manner.

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops. On his way to school, he consumes 2, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he distributes 14 lollipops to his friends, resulting in 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops remaining.

Subsequently, Oscar purchases twice the number of lollipops he gave away, which is 2 * 14 = 28. Adding this to the 8 lollipops he already has, he now has a total of 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

The following day, Oscar consumes 3 lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, resulting in 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we first need to calculate the remaining charge. Since the phone is currently at 60% charged, it requires an additional 100% - 60% = 40% to reach full capacity.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge the remaining 40% by multiplying the remaining charge by the charging rate.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour.

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we need to consider the sequence of events. Initially, Erin possesses 7 lollipops. Her mother then gifts her an additional 10 lollipops, resulting in a total of 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Following this, Erin donates 3 lollipops to Ella. To find the final number of lollipops Erin retains, we subtract the number of lollipops given away from the total: 17 - 3 = 14.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the amount the customer paid on their shopping trip, we need to consider the rewards earned from their previous purchase and the coupon applied to the current purchase.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which earns them $1 off for every $20 spent. Therefore, they earned 4 rewards, each worth $1, totaling $4.

On their current shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, resulting in a $4 discount. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount applied to their purchase is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find the amount the customer paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent: $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we need to calculate the total income, subtract the property tax, and then subtract the income tax for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. Since there's no mention of property tax for this job, we can proceed with the income tax calculation. The income tax is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. Therefore, the net income for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The income tax is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. Consequently, the net income for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we first need to find the total number of ruined castles. Given that 40% of the 220 castles in Scotland are ruins, we can calculate this as follows:

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Now, we are told that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. Therefore, to find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we divide the total number of ruined castles by 2:

88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer. 

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. The total amount paid in installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. The total amount paid in installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine the number of paintball guns each person would have if they were shared equally, we need to calculate the total number of guns and then divide by the number of individuals.

First, let's add up the total number of guns: DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 

Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

There are 4 people. To find out how many guns each person would have, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people.

24 / 4 = 6

Therefore, if the paintball guns were shared equally, each person would have 6 guns.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we must first calculate the amount required for each type of confectionery. For 8 batches of suckers, the sugar requirement is 8 times the amount needed for a single batch, which is 8 * 30 ounces = 240 ounces.

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for a batch of fudge, which is 70 ounces.

To find the total amount of sugar required, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"
"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

The initial price of each share is $8. In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%, which is equivalent to a 0.5 multiplier. Therefore, the price of each share after the first year is $8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%, which is equivalent to a 0.75 multiplier. Therefore, the price of each share after the second year is $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Since Maria owns 8 shares, the total value of all her shares after the second year is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To determine the difference in the number of hot dogs eaten by John and Luke, we first need to establish the number of hot dogs consumed by each individual.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas, on the other hand, consumed three times more hot dogs than Luke, which equates to 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

John's consumption is half that of Thomas', so he ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find the difference in the number of hot dogs eaten by John and Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number eaten by John: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as x. Since the last group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. This gives us the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms to simplify the equation:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with the variable:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:

x = 70

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation H + C = 60.

We are also given that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, which can be expressed as H = 2C.

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for C. Substituting H = 2C into H + C = 60 gives us 2C + C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting C into the equation H = 2C. This gives us H = 2(20) = 40.

Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs of the chickens as 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows as 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of balls Josh has left to juggle, we need to consider his initial number of balls and the changes that occur during the talent show.

Josh starts by juggling 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. This means he has 3 + 4 = 7 balls at the end of the fourth week.

When Josh drops 3 balls on stage, 2 are caught by the crowd, but 1 is lost. Therefore, the net change in the number of balls is -1.

To find the number of balls Josh has left, we subtract the net change from the initial number of balls: 7 - 1 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationships between the weights of the animals and the container. Let's denote the weight of the pink frog as P, the blue beetle as B, the green toad as T, the yellow snake as S, the red bird as R, and the container as C.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. P = B
2. P = T
3. S = P + 10
4. R = P - 20
5. C = 20

We are also given that the weight of the pink frog (P) is 50 pounds. Substituting this value into the equations above, we get:

1. B = 50
2. T = 50
3. S = 50 + 10 = 60
4. R = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we can find the total weight of the animals and the container by adding their individual weights:

Total weight = P + B + T + S + R + C
= 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
= 260 pounds

The final answer is: 260"
"To determine the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we need to calculate the cumulative sum of the outfits she received from her friend, the new outfits she obtained at the baby shower, and the outfits gifted by her mom.

Laurel's friend initially provided her with 24 baby outfits. At the baby shower, she received twice the amount of new outfits, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits. Her mom then gifted her an additional 15 outfits.

To find the total number of outfits, we add these quantities together: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice. 

The coach wants Tyson to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find this additional distance, we divide the original daily distance by 5. The original daily distance is 5000 meters, so the additional distance is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters.

Therefore, the new daily distance is the sum of the original and additional distances, which is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is the product of the new daily distance and the number of days, which is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"To determine the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we first need to establish the price of each. 

Juice Box A is priced at 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so its price is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. 

Similarly, Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so its price is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of legs of the restaurant's tables, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of table and then sum them together.

First, we calculate the number of legs for the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.

Next, we calculate the number of legs for the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of tables to find the total: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

The total number of legs of the restaurant's tables is 310."
"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, which is a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, resulting in a total of 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies used by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are used by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies.

36 - 27 = 9

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To determine the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 40% of the original price of $30.

The discount can be calculated as follows: 40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price of one shirt: $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos purchased 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to find the total cost: $18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in the amount the factory makes per day, we first need to calculate the difference in their daily earnings before and after switching from making tractors to silos.

The factory sold 10 tractors a day at $100 per tractor, resulting in a daily revenue of 10 * $100 = $1000.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day at $220 per silo, resulting in a daily revenue of 5 * $220 = $1100.

The difference in their daily earnings is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula: ((difference / original amount) * 100). Substituting the values, we get ((100 / 1000) * 100) = 10%.

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they made tractors.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply by 12.

First, let's calculate the monthly cost of food for her dog. Given that food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100.

Next, we add the monthly costs of treats and medicine to the food cost. Treats cost $20 per month, and medicine costs $100 per month. Therefore, the total monthly cost is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

To find the total annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $220 * 12 = $2640.

The final answer is: $2640"
"To determine the total time Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

The yoga class on Monday lasts for 1 hour. The cooking class on Tuesday is three times as long as the yoga class, so it will last for 3 hours. The cheese-tasting event on Wednesday is a half-hour long, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. The museum tour on Thursday takes half the time of the cooking class, so it will last for 1.5 hours. Finally, Peyton has 2 hours of errands scheduled for Friday.

Now, let's calculate the total time by adding up the duration of all activities:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs for the daisies and roses. 

The school requires 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since they also need twice as many plant pots for the roses, we can find this by multiplying the number of plant pots needed for the daisies by 2. This gives us 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

Now, we can find the total number of plant pots needed by adding the number of plant pots required for the daisies and roses: 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April had already purchased 100 plant pots from the garden center, we can find the number of plant pots she has left over by subtracting the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we can start by identifying the initial amount of money she had, which is $36. After spending $11 on a sweater and giving her brother $4, we can calculate the amount she had left.

The amount spent on the sweater and given to her brother is $11 + $4 = $15. Subtracting this from the initial amount, we get:

$36 (initial amount) - $15 (amount spent) = $21 (amount left)

Since the amount left is the result of subtracting the amount spent from the initial amount, we can infer that the amount left is the amount Andrea saved. Therefore, the amount Andrea saved is $21.

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to find the amount Andrea saved before spending the $11 on the sweater and giving her brother $4. To do this, we can subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount:

$36 (initial amount) - $15 (amount spent) = $21 (amount left)

But we want to find the amount she saved before spending. Let's call the amount she saved 'x'. Then, the amount she had after saving is the initial amount minus the amount she saved:

x (amount saved) + $11 (sweater) + $4 (given to brother) = $36 (initial amount)

Combine like terms:

x + $15 = $36

Subtract $15 from both sides:

x = $21

However, this is the amount she had after saving, not the amount she saved. To find the amount she saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount:

$36 (initial amount) - $21 (amount left) = $15 (amount saved)

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we first need to calculate the total time he spent on his activities. 

Let's start by calculating the time spent on boating and swimming. The time spent boating is given as 6 hours, and the time spent swimming is half of that, which is 3 hours. 

Next, we calculate the time spent watching shows. Since there are 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find the total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. We can use this information to find the total time by setting up the equation: 0.30 * total time = 6. Solving for the total time, we get total time = 6 / 0.30 = 20 hours.

Since the time spent sightseeing is 40% of the total time, we can find it by multiplying 0.40 by the total time: 0.40 * 20 = 8 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the amount Annabelle still needs to save for the phone, we must first calculate her total earnings from both jobs. 

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work, resulting in a total of $10 * 20 = $200.

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work, yielding a total of $5 * 15 = $75.

Combining her earnings from both jobs, we find that she has a total of $200 + $75 = $275.

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. To find the amount she still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $275 = $125.

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to purchase the phone.

"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we first need to calculate the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet, and the second tree is 5 feet taller, so its height is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

Given that the height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, we can calculate its height as 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the amount of money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent on the toys and then subtract that from the total amount he received.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 = $12

"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract it from her budget.

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $35 = 1.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.57 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $55 - $5 = $50. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$50 / $35 = 1.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.43 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $50 - $20 = $30. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$30 / $35 = 0.86

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.86 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the mini-golf in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $30 - $5 = $25. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$25 / $35 = 0.71

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.71 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $25 - $5 = $20. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$20 / $35 = 0.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.57 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $20 - $5 = $15. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$15 / $35 = 0.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.43 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $15 - $20 = -5. 

Since the remaining budget is negative, we can't invite any friends.

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the mini-golf in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $15 - $5 = $10. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$10 / $35 = 0.29

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.29 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $10 - $5 = $5. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$5 / $35 = 0.14

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"To determine the amount of money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply it by the number of days she saves.

First, let's calculate the cost of the lollipops. Each lollipop costs $0.25, and she buys 4 of them every day. Therefore, the total cost of lollipops per day is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, we can find her daily savings by subtracting the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money. Her daily pocket money is $5, so her daily savings are $5 - $1 = $4.

To find the total amount she saves in 5 days, we multiply her daily savings by the number of days: $4 x 5 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the amount of candy Billy purchased, we can start by establishing the relationship between the money he spent on candy and the money he spent on gumballs.

Let's denote the amount of candy Billy bought as 'x' pounds. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is 1.5x.

Billy initially had $10. After buying the candy, he had 10 - 1.5x dollars left. He then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Subtracting 10 from both sides yields:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the age of Carver's son, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the son's age as 'x'. According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be expressed as:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of days the train goes between services, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled in one trip. The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 125 miles from the third city to the first city (since 175 - 50 = 125). 

The total distance in one trip is the sum of these distances: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 miles * 3 = 900 miles.

The train requires service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the amount of stuffing required for Mark's custom dog beds, we need to calculate the amount needed for each type of bed and then sum the total.

First, let's find the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, we can calculate this by taking the average of the two values. The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2.

Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the total time John spent on his trip, we must first calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey. 

The initial distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken to cover this distance is given by the formula: time = distance / speed. Substituting the given values, we get time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.857 hours (approximately).

However, John had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. Therefore, the total distance to his friend's house is 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles. The time taken to cover this distance is 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

After reaching his friend's house, John takes a route home that is 240 miles and drives at a speed of 80 mph. Using the same formula, the time taken to drive back home is 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

The total time spent on the trip is the sum of the time taken for each leg: 3 hours (to his friend's house) + 3 hours (back home) = 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to calculate the total number of students present. 

The total number of fourth-graders at the school is 96. On Friday, 9 students were absent, consisting of 5 girls and 4 boys. 

Total students absent = 5 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 9

To find the number of students present, we subtract the total number of absent students from the total number of fourth-graders.

Total students present = 96 - 9 = 87

Since we know the number of girls present is 38 (calculated by subtracting the absent girls from the total number of girls), we can find the number of boys present by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students present.

Number of boys present = Total students present - Number of girls present
= 87 - 38
= 49

The final answer is: 49"
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we need to calculate the number of boys and then add it to the number of girls.

Now, to find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of boys to the number of girls: 6 (girls) + 12 (boys) = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we need to calculate the remaining points required to meet the total of 42. 

We know that Jane scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. To find the total points scored so far, we add these two values together.

Points scored in the first test = 15
Points scored in the second test = 18
Points scored so far = 15 + 18 = 33

Now, we subtract the points scored so far from the total required points to find the minimum points needed on the third test.

Total required points = 42
Points needed on the third test = Total required points - Points scored so far
= 42 - 33
= 9

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to meet the minimum requirement of 42 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by breaking down the given information. We know that 3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. Additionally, a number equal to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. This can be expressed as 4 * 3 - 5 = 7. Therefore, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

Furthermore, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since there were 7 shoplifters, this equates to 3 * 7 = 21 customers kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we are given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we can subtract the sum of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of people kicked out.

The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence is 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. Subtracting this from the total number of people kicked out gives us 50 - 31 = 19.

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between Erin's and Sara's points. We are given that Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. This implies that Erin's current points can be expressed as 3 times Sara's points, which is 3 * 8 = 24 points.

However, we are also given that Erin currently has 14 points. To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to determine the difference between Erin's total points (24) and her current points (14).

Let's calculate Erin's points before: 
Erin's points before = Erin's total points - Erin's current points 
Erin's points before = 24 - 14 
Erin's points before = 10

"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's consider the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. Therefore, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to account for the etching cost, which is 20% of the cost of each picture frame. This amounts to $4 per frame. With 44 frames, the total etching cost is 44 * $4 = $176.

The total cost of the picture frames and etching is then $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will receive pins at a cost of $5 each, totaling 2 * $5 = $10.

Lastly, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 11 individuals. Each officer will receive a cord at a cost of $12. Therefore, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

To find the total cost of all the gifts, we add the costs of the picture frames and etching, the pins, and the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To determine the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20% of the original cost, we can calculate the materials cost by subtracting 20% of $400 from the original cost. 

20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

Therefore, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:
50 * 2 = 100

"To determine the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the value of the faulty pieces. Given that the total amount spent is $400,000 and the faulty pieces constitute 40% of this total, we can find the value of the faulty pieces by multiplying the total amount by the percentage of faulty pieces.

40% of $400,000 can be calculated as 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

Now, to find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount spent: $400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

The final answer is: $240,000"

The milk from half of the sheep is 15 * 1 kg = 15 kg.

The milk from the other half of the sheep is 15 * 2 kg = 30 kg.

Therefore, the total milk collected is 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Since she started with a dozen rolls, which is equivalent to 12 rolls, and fed 6 children, the number of rolls remaining can be calculated as follows:

12 (initial rolls) - 6 (rolls fed to children) = 6 rolls

Next, we need to find the total number of pieces created by breaking each of the remaining rolls into 8 equal parts. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of remaining rolls by the number of pieces per roll:

6 (remaining rolls) * 8 (pieces per roll) = 48 pieces

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

Next, we need to find the number of pupils who like green. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5.

Now, we can find the total number of pupils who like blue and green by adding the number of pupils who like blue and the number of pupils who like green: 20 + 5 = 25.

Finally, to find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the total number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils: 40 - 25 = 15.

$56 / $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked on each day:

Since she washed 10 pairs of socks, we multiply the number of pairs by 2 to account for the fact that each pair consists of two socks. This gives us 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs.

In addition to the paired socks, Lindsay also washed 15 loose socks. To find the total number of socks she has washed, we add the number of paired socks to the number of loose socks: 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, we can find the number of socks Lindsay has missed by subtracting the total number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 50 - 35 = 15.

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she initially had and then subtract the number of cookies her brother ate.

First, we add the number of cookies Rachel bought to the number of cookies Janet gave her. This gives us the total number of cookies Rachel had.

Initial cookies = 23
Cookies from Janet = 42
Total cookies = 23 + 42 = 65

Next, we subtract the number of cookies her brother ate from the total number of cookies.

Cookies eaten by brother = 44
Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten by brother
Cookies left = 65 - 44
Cookies left = 21

Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is 21."
"To determine the monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating the total amount to be paid, which is the sum of the principal and the interest. The interest is calculated as the product of the principal, interest rate, and time.

Given that the principal is $3,650, the interest rate is 10% or 0.10, and the time is 5 months, we can calculate the total interest as follows:
Total interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Total interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Total interest = $1,825

The total amount to be paid is the sum of the principal and the interest:
Total amount = Principal + Total interest
Total amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total amount = $5,475

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
Monthly payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To determine the distance each person hiked, we can use the formula distance = speed * time. 

For Cho, the distance hiked is 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km. 

For Chloe, the distance hiked is 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km.

To find the difference in distance hiked, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance: 112 km - 45 km = 67 km.

The final answer is: 67"
"To determine the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they possess.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which is 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we first need to calculate the total revenue generated from selling the lemonade and then subtract the initial cost of supplies to find the total profit. 

Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, with each pitcher holding 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is 3 * 12 = 36 cups.

Since each cup of lemonade is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The initial cost of supplies is $18. Thus, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

To find the profit per hour, we need to determine the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the time required to sell 36 cups is 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Therefore, the profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to find the number of female members in the choir. Given that the choir consists of 52 members, with 50% being boys and 50% being girls, we can calculate the number of girls as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

However, on the day of the performance, half the people scheduled to perform were unable to make it due to their bus breaking down. This means that only half of the female members were able to perform, which is 26 / 2 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers then decided to join the performance, bringing the total number of people who sang to 13 (female members who made it) + 3 (teachers) = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. This can be achieved by summing the scores and then dividing by the total number of scores.

First, we add up all the scores:

159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide the sum by the number of scores to find the average:
400 / 5 = 80

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we first need to calculate the individual costs.

The cost of 6 erasers can be found by multiplying the cost of a single eraser by the number of erasers: 6 * $2 = $12.

Similarly, the cost of 8 pencils is calculated by multiplying the cost of a single pencil by the number of pencils: 8 * $3 = $24.

Now, to find the total cost, we add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can find this by multiplying the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To determine the amount of money David saves by purchasing a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4. Therefore, the cost of 9 rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides, resulting in a total cost of $36. In contrast, David purchases a ride bracelet for $30, which grants him access to 9 rides.

Since they both ride all 9 rides, the cost for Dasha is $36, while the cost for David is $30. Consequently, David saves $36 - $30 = $6.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts: 
6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts

Now, let's divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. Given that the ratio of Betty's popsicles to Sam's popsicles is 5:6, we can represent the number of popsicles each has as 5x and 6x, respectively, where x is a constant multiplier.

We are also given that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can set up the equation 5x + 6x = 165 to represent the total number of popsicles.

Combining like terms, we get 11x = 165. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11, yielding x = 15.

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has by substituting x into the expressions 5x and 6x. This gives us 5(15) = 75 popsicles for Betty and 6(15) = 90 popsicles for Sam.

To find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the amount of money Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services he has chosen. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but since Tim is bundling them, he receives a 20% discount. To find the discount, we calculate 20% of $20 (the combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus). 

20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4

The bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by canceling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the percentage of time Carol spent editing the song, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on the entire process. 

The time spent writing the song is 4 hours, the time spent recording it is half of that, which is 2 hours, and the time spent editing is 90 minutes, or 1.5 hours. 

To find the total time, we add these values together: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

Now, to find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100. 

(1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

Therefore, the percentage of time Carol spent editing the song is 20%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of books Wendy wants to place, we first need to calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. Given that it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we can find the total number of books by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns.

The total capacity of the shelving system is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Next, we need to find double the number of books in the shelving system. This is calculated as 2 * 36 = 72.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we add 20 to the result: 72 + 20 = 92.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To determine the current number of Valentine's cards Erica possesses, we must first calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards her dad brought, and then account for the cards she distributed and received.

Erica initially had 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards, resulting in a total of 2 * 15 = 30 additional cards.

Combining the initial 20 cards with the 30 cards from her dad, Erica had a total of 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

Erica then distributed 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, totaling 24 + 5 = 29 cards given away.

Subtracting the 29 cards she distributed from the 50 cards she had, Erica was left with 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

Finally, Erica received 17 cards from family and friends, bringing her total to 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

The final numerical answer is: 38"

= 30

Therefore, Mark must save for 30 days to afford the bike.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of bugs, we first need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs.

The number of millipedes is 1/3rd the number of spiders, which is 90. To find 1/3rd of 90, we divide 90 by 3, resulting in 30 millipedes.

Next, we calculate the number of stink bugs, which is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Since there are 30 millipedes, twice that number is 2 * 30 = 60. Subtracting 12 from this gives us 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs: 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we first need to determine their respective ages. Given that Erica is 30 years old, we can calculate Beth's age as she is 5 years older than Erica. This results in Beth being 30 + 5 = 35 years old.

Next, we calculate Alice's age, which is 7 years older than Beth's age. Therefore, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica can be found by subtracting Erica's age from Alice's age, yielding 42 - 30 = 12.

"To determine the total calories consumed by John, we need to calculate the total ounces of milk he drank and then multiply it by the calories per ounce. 

John drank 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. Therefore, the total ounces of milk he consumed is 2 * 8 = 16 ounces.

Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, the total calories consumed by John can be calculated as follows:

Total calories = Total ounces * Calories per ounce
Total calories = 16 * 3
Total calories = 48

Therefore, John consumed a total of 48 calories from the milk."
"To determine the builder's annual earnings, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the total number of days he works in a year.

First, let's find the total number of days he works in a year. Since he works 4 weeks every month and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of weeks he works in a year is 4 * 12 = 48 weeks. Given that he works 6 days every week, the total number of days he works in a year is 48 * 6 = 288 days.

Now, let's find his daily earnings. He gets paid $50 every day.

To find his total earnings in a year, we multiply his daily earnings by the total number of days he works in a year: $50 * 288 = $14400.

"To determine the number of bags of flour Mark needs to buy, we divide the total amount of flour required by the amount of flour in each bag. The total flour required for a quadruple batch of brownies is 4 times the amount in the normal recipe, which is 3 cups. Therefore, the total flour required is 4 * 3 = 12 cups. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide the total flour required by the amount in each bag: 12 / 2 = 6 bags.

Similarly, to find the number of bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we divide the total amount of milk required by the amount of milk in each bottle. The total milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies is 4 times the amount in the normal recipe, which is 1 cup. Therefore, the total milk required is 4 * 1 = 4 cups. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide the total milk required by the amount in each bottle: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk. This is calculated as follows: 6 (bags of flour) - 2 (bottles of milk) = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we first need to calculate the original energy consumption and the new energy consumption after reducing the usage time.

The original energy consumption per day is calculated by multiplying the power rating of the air conditioner (900 watts) by the number of hours it is used (8 hours). This gives us 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

If Mel reduces the usage time by 5 hours, the new energy consumption per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new energy consumption, which is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy savings by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

The final numerical answer is: 135"

There is one zebra with 36 stripes.
There is another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

The average number of stripes is 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total cost of the ingredients for the muffaletta sandwiches, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Given that each sandwich serves 4 people, we can find this by dividing the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, the total amount of each ingredient needed is equal to the number of sandwiches.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese.

Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we first need to establish the initial quantities of corn and cannolis in Allan's house. We are given that there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and the total number of cannolis is 40. Therefore, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, Allan purchases 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 fewer corns than that, which is 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we can calculate the total number of corns and cannolis in Allan's house by adding the initial quantities to the quantities he purchased: 
Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns purchased: 20
Cannolis purchased: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100
Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200.

"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. Since he finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, and he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 5,000 steps.

Additionally, he took an extra 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. Therefore, before his jog, Elliott completed a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Given that he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. This would be 10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete.

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog. This would be 4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport, we first need to calculate the total time it will take him to read the book. Given that the book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby's reading rate is 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time it will take him to read the book is 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.

Additionally, it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. Consequently, Toby will arrive at the airport 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes after he starts reading.

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we can calculate the time difference by subtracting the time he arrives from the time he has to be there: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early at the airport."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wages.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, resulting in a total of 160 hours per employee. With an hourly wage of $15, the total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. Consequently, the total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, leaving 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 30 employees. Each of these employees worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, resulting in a total of 160 hours per employee. With an hourly wage of $15, the total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. Therefore, the total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe yields 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can find the required number of dozens by dividing the total number of cookies by 12:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the intersection of the two conditions.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, which is 0.05 * 50,000 = 2,500 candles.

However, the problem states that these candles are a subset of the more dangerous candles, which are guaranteed to be 99% safe. This means that 1% of the total candles are more dangerous. The number of more dangerous candles is 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, we can find this by multiplying 0.05 by the number of more dangerous candles: 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from the tallest and shortest trees. Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples gathered from the average trees as A, and the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees as S.

We are given that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister's T is 2 * 30 = 60.

We are also given that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so S = 30 / 2 = 15. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister's S is 3 * 15 = 45.

Now, let's consider the total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister. We know that the total number of apples gathered by Joanne is T + A + S, and the total number of apples gathered by her sister is 2T + 3S. We are given that the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500.

We can set up the equation: T + A + S + 2T + 3S = 500. Substituting the values we have, we get 30 + A + 15 + 60 + 45 = 500.

Simplifying the equation, we get A + 150 = 500. Solving for A, we get A = 350.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, which means the sum of the number of camels and dromedaries is 180. This can be expressed as:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to eliminate the variable D. We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to get:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we have the value of C, we can substitute it into the first equation to find the value of D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, the number of dromedaries in the herd is 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the journey into its constituent parts and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

First, let's consider the initial four days of the trip. During this period, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. Therefore, the total distance covered in the first four days is the product of the daily distance and the number of days:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we need to calculate the distance traveled over the subsequent two days. It is given that this distance is 30% of the distance covered in the first four days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.3:
(0.3) * 800 km = 240 km
Thus, the total distance traveled in the next two days is 240 km.

On the following day, Tom did not travel at all, so the distance covered is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. Since there are seven days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled by adding the distances covered in each segment of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final numerical answer is: 3140"
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we can start by analyzing the given information. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and that it is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This implies that Zack's locker is 4 times as big as Peter's locker, which can be calculated as 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches.

Next, we are told that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This means that Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's locker, which can be calculated as 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches.

Therefore, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the elevation at which Stanley's comb landed, we need to consider the initial elevation from which it fell and the distance it fell. 

Stanley's initial elevation is 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the elevation at which the comb landed is 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.

Now, to find the distance Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's current elevation. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. 

The distance Oliver must climb is 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to consider the initial amount he had and the funds he received from the two banks. 

First, let's identify the initial capital: $5000. 

Next, we know that the first bank provided $4000. 

The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks: $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

To find the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To determine the number of cats left on the rock, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, resulting in a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats being taken away.

The number of cats remaining on the rock after the boats departed is 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we can multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.

The number of cats left on the rock is the remaining cats minus the cats that ran after the mouse: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break down the cost into three distinct periods based on the pricing structure.

The first 6 months are priced at $8 per month, resulting in a total cost of 6 * $8 = $48.

The subsequent 8 months are priced at $12 per month, resulting in a total cost of 8 * $12 = $96.

The remaining months, which are 24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months, are priced at $14 per month, resulting in a total cost of 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by summing the costs of each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. We are given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can express this relationship as J = T - 6.

We are also given that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can express this as (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Substituting J = T - 6 into the second equation, we get (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6. Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we have 3T - 6 = 18. Adding 6 to both sides, we get 3T = 24. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans by substituting T = 8 into the equation J = T - 6. This gives us J = 8 - 6 = 2.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and sum them together.

First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses. There are 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each, so the total capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses. There are 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each, so the total capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

Lastly, we calculate the capacity of the minivans. There are 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each, so the total capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{570}$"
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then sum them together.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

Lillian made 3 homemade feeders and bought 3 store-bought feeders. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted to the homemade and store-bought feeders, which is 3(x + 10) + 3x.

Simplifying the expression, we get 3x + 30 + 3x = 6x + 30.

Since the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 20, we can set up the equation 3x = 20 and solve for x.

3x = 20
x = 20 / 3
x = 6.67

However, since x represents the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders, it must be a whole number. This is a contradiction, as 20 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, we must re-examine the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem statement. We are given that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. This means that the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 20, and the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 20 + 10 = 30.

Since Lillian made 3 homemade feeders and bought 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90, and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 90 + 60 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of the bagel is $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is calculated as 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5.
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

The total cost of Aleksandra's dinner is $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To determine the initial number of Pokémon cards Kenny had, we need to consider the amount of money he has and the price at which he sells the cards. Since Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the amusement park ticket costs $100, he must make $50 from selling the cards.

Given that each card is sold for $1.5, we can calculate the number of cards he sold by dividing the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5 = 33.33

However, since Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.33

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 Pokémon cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we first need to calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared by the caterer. 

The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs, which is 18 guests. This results in 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for these guests. 

For the other half of the guests (also 18), the caterer prepared 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs. 

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, when 40 guests showed up, each wanting a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs required is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. This means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to determine half of the letters in Indras' name. Since Indras has 6 letters, half of that would be 6 / 2 = 3.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 6 + 7 = 13.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order, we must first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount is applied. This involves summing the individual costs of the set of pot and pans, the set of mixing bowls, and the five separate utensils.

The set of pot and pans costs $120.00, the set of mixing bowls costs $20.00, and the five separate utensils, each costing $5.00, amount to a total of 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

Therefore, the total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we calculate the discount, which is 20% of the total cost before the discount. This can be computed as 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Finally, we determine the total cost after the discount by subtracting the discount from the total cost before the discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To determine the amount of money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she wishes to purchase. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Therefore, the total cost is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, which amounts to $18. To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to establish the number of dragons each prince slew. 

Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is 75. 

Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, who slew 150 dragons. Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 150 / 5 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Now, we need to convert the amount of gas in one container from gallons to pints. Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 pints

However, Josey only needed 1/4 of a container. To find 1/4 of 3 gallons, we can multiply 3 by 1/4.

3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallons

Now, we convert 3/4 gallons to pints by multiplying 3/4 by 8.

(3/4) * 8 = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the total amount of money George spent on chips. Since he bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, the total cost of the chips is 3 * 0.40 = $1.20.

Next, we can find the amount of money George spent on candy bars by subtracting the cost of the chips from the total amount he spent. This gives us $5 - $1.20 = $3.80.

Now, we can find the number of candy bars George bought by dividing the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar, which is 75 cents or $0.75. This gives us $3.80 / $0.75 = 5.0667.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we first need to calculate the number of lollipops he shared with them. Since he kept 5 lollipops for himself, we subtract this from the total number of lollipops he initially had.

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5, so the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Now, we divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends to find out how many each received. There are 4 friends, so each friend received 20 / 4 = 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we first need to calculate the weight of each piece. Since the cake is cut into 8 equal pieces, we can divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Given that Rory and her mom each have a piece, we can calculate the total weight of the cake they consumed.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges available for sharing. Sitti and Juris have 34 and 22 oranges, respectively.

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, the total number of individuals sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find the number of oranges each person will receive, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:
56 ÷ 8 = 7

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we must first calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but Antoine wants to double the amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. Given that the onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

In addition to the onions, Antoine requires 2 boxes of beef stock, each costing $2.00. Therefore, the total cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of onions and beef stock, which is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we can calculate the cost per serving by dividing the total cost of the ingredients by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then add 5 minutes to it.

Let's denote the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater as W. Since it takes Bernadette four times as long as Wayne to get to the theater, the time it takes Bernadette can be represented as 4W.

Given that it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, we can substitute W = 4 into the equation for Bernadette's time: 4W = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne. Since Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we can set up the equation: Bernadette's departure time - Wayne's departure time = 5 minutes.

We know that Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, so she needs to leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.

However, since we are looking for the difference in departure times, we need to consider the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater. If Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 11 minutes before Wayne arrives, which is equivalent to leaving 11 + 4 = 15 minutes before Wayne leaves.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. Given that the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we must convert the length to feet, as the standard unit of measurement for the perimeter is feet.

Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, we can calculate the length in feet as follows:
3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

With the length and width known, we can now calculate the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each of them has.

Elizabeth purchased 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has a total of 1 x 20 + 2 x 20 = 60 beads.

Margareth, on the other hand, bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. This gives her a total of 3 x 20 + 4 x 20 = 140 beads.

Now, we can find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters by subtracting the total number of beads Elizabeth has from the total number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the effects of the oven and the open window on the temperature.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Next, we need to calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The window is open for 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. Since the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, for 30 minutes, it cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Now, we can calculate the final temperature of the house. The initial temperature is 40 degrees. The temperature increase due to the oven is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease due to the open window is 6 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"To determine the time it took James to complete the run, we must first calculate his total time for the triathlon. Given that Jon's total time is 170 minutes and he won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Next, we need to find James' times for the swim and bike. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, his swim time is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes. Additionally, James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we can calculate James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{59}$"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first determine the length of Movie B and then calculate one-fourth of that value.

We are given that Movie C is 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, Movie C is 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes long.

Next, we are told that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B: 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Finally, we are asked to find the length of Movie A, which is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To do this, we divide the length of Movie B by 4: 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

"To determine the amount of hay the horse consumes, we first need to calculate the distance it runs. Given that the horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, we must convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. 

Using the formula Distance = Speed * Time, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 32 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse consumes 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will consume a total of 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, totaling $30. To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she has available. This can be done by adding the number of eggs in the cases to the number of loose eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make with the available eggs. Each glass requires 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Finally, we need to determine how many trays Rozanne can fill with the glasses of eggnog. Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the total number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of the sneakers and then subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, resulting in a revenue of:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, we calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
$340 + $775 = $1115

Now, we subtract the initial cost of the case of sneakers, which was $576, from the total revenue to find the profit:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The final answer is: $539"
"To determine the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each and the four packets with 16 pieces each.

First, we calculate the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each: 6 * 8 = 48

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each: 4 * 16 = 64

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets to find the total: 48 + 64 = 112

The total number of crayons Beatrice bought is 112."
"To determine the regular price of popcorn, let's analyze the given information. We know that a movie super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for an additional $1. Additionally, we are told that the soda costs $3.

If we buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If we buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference represents the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost of filling one balloon. Let's denote the original cost as x. The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can set up the equation 20x = 900.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45.

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. Multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11050.

"To determine the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours is given by the product of the speed and time, which is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles. Similarly, the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour is 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles. The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances, which is 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

The total time taken for the trip is the sum of the individual times, which is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

The average speed is then calculated as the total distance divided by the total time, which is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Initially, Jenna has 8 sapphires. After trading 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, she is left with 5 sapphires.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

The value of the rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy consume in 30 days, we first need to calculate their combined daily consumption. Since each of them eats 4 apples a day, their combined daily consumption is 4 + 4 = 8 apples.

Now, to find the total number of apples consumed over 30 days, we multiply their combined daily consumption by 30:

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the volume of soil required for the raised beds. Each bed is a rectangular prism with dimensions 2 feet in width, 8 feet in length, and 2 feet in height. The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

For one bed, the volume is V = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags required is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Given that there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of fairies remaining, we need to analyze the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn observed 50 fairies. Subsequently, one of her friends noticed half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the existing group. This implies that 25 fairies joined the group, resulting in a total of 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

Following this, 30 fairies flew away. To find the number of fairies remaining, we subtract the number of fairies that departed from the total: 75 - 30 = 45.

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we calculate the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make to transport the feed, we must first calculate the total weight of the feed. 

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds, as the farmer purchases two 1-pound boxes. The weight of the carrots is 48 pounds, as four 12-pound bags are purchased. The weight of the hay is 3150 pounds, as 42 bales weighing 75 pounds each are bought. Lastly, the weight of the oats is 1300 pounds, as 20 sacks weighing 65 pounds each are purchased.

The total weight of the feed is the sum of the weights of each type of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Given that the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we can calculate the number of trips by dividing the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity.

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we must round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we need to calculate the total value of the aluminum cans and plastic bottles she recycles each week.

First, we calculate the weekly earnings from aluminum cans: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

Next, we calculate the weekly earnings from plastic bottles: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

Now, we add the weekly earnings from both sources to find the total weekly earnings: 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4 to find the total monthly earnings: 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we first need to calculate the number of plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can find Toni's total by adding 60% of 10 to 10.

First, we calculate 60% of 10:
60% of 10 = 0.6 * 10 = 6

Now, we add this to the number of plants Frederick has:
Toni's plants = 10 + 6 = 16

With Toni's total known, we can now find Shondra's total by subtracting 7 from Toni's total:
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7 = 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the current amount Ali possesses, we need to calculate the amount Leila donated to him and then add it to the initial amount he had.

Leila donated half of her $100, which is equivalent to $100 / 2 = $50.

Ali initially had $21. 

Therefore, the total amount Ali now has is $21 + $50 = $71.

The final answer is: $71"
"To determine the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate 1/5 of the cost of the pizza and add it to the cost of the pizza. 

The cost of the pizza is $15. To find 1/5 of this amount, we can multiply $15 by 1/5, which is equivalent to dividing $15 by 5.

Tip = $15 / 5
Tip = $3

Now, we can find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man by adding the cost of the pizza and the tip.

Total amount = Cost of the pizza + Tip
Total amount = $15 + $3
Total amount = $18

The final answer is: $18"

"To determine the number of students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she possesses. 

She has six decks of basketball cards, each containing 25 cards, resulting in a total of 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards.

Additionally, she has five boxes of baseball cards, with each box containing 40 cards, leading to a total of 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards.

Combining these totals, we find that Miss Maria has 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) = 350 cards in total.

Since Miss Maria retains 50 cards for herself, the number of cards she distributes to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Given that each student receives 10 cards, the number of students can be calculated as 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the difference in the amount paid by Kelly and Becky, we first need to calculate the total cost of the apples for each individual.

Becky purchased 20 apples at 45 cents each. The total cost of the apples is 20 * 0.45 = $9. However, she received a $1 discount, which reduces her total cost to $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly, on the other hand, bought 20 apples at 50 cents each. The total cost of the apples is 20 * 0.50 = $10. She received a 10% discount, which is 0.10 * $10 = $1. Therefore, her total cost is $10 - $1 = $9.

To find the difference in the amount paid by Kelly and Becky, we subtract Becky's total cost from Kelly's total cost: $9 - $8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply it by the total number of rooms.

Each room has 2 sheets, 1 comforter, 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases (since there are twice as many pillow cases as sheets), and 2 * 4 = 8 towels (since there are twice as many towels as pillow cases).

The total number of items per room is the sum of these: 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15.

Now, we multiply the total number of items per room by the total number of rooms: 15 * 80 = 1200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To determine the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday, we need to calculate the cumulative number of shoes he acquires and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of on Saturday.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes. On Monday, he receives 5 pairs of shoes, which equates to 10 additional shoes (5 pairs * 2 shoes per pair). On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, amounting to 30 additional shoes (15 pairs * 2 shoes per pair). Finally, on Friday, he acquires 30 new pairs of shoes, resulting in 60 additional shoes (30 pairs * 2 shoes per pair).

The total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs is the sum of the initial shoes and the shoes acquired: 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

However, on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. To find the total number of shoes he has on Sunday, we subtract the shoes he discarded from the total: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the number of pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we first need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is 6 * 8 = 48.

Next, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide 48 by 12 to get the number of pans.

48 / 12 = 4

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of change Theo received, we first need to calculate the cost of the paper. Since it costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen, we can express this as 3x - 1, where x is the price of the pen. Given that the price of the pen is $2, we can substitute x with 2 and calculate the cost of the paper as 3(2) - 1 = 6 - 1 = $5.

The total cost of the pen and the paper is then $2 + $5 = $7.

Since Theo gave the cashier $10, the change she received is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the number of pencils left at the end of the year, we first need to determine the total number of pencils initially in the class. Since there are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils initially is 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

Next, we calculate the number of pencils used after two months. 1/5 of the total pencils were used, which is 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils.

The remaining pencils after two months are then 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

Finally, at the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. Therefore, the number of pencils left is 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt must eat 6 carrot sticks to have the opportunity to eat 5 cookies."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to first determine the combined length of the remoras. Since the remoras are 6 inches long and there are two of them, we can convert their length to feet for consistency with the shark's length.

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy.

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

Therefore, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the total number of students at the grade level, we can use the information that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. Since 20 students do not have a desktop computer, we can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to isolate x:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, the total number of students at the grade level is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine how many days Jason has to walk in total in 3 weeks, we need to multiply the number of weeks by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

However, Jason can only walk 4 days a week. To find out how many days he has to walk in total in 3 weeks, we need to divide the total number of days by the number of days he can walk per week.

21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4

"To determine the number of books each child received, we first need to calculate the total number of books purchased by Sarah. This can be done by dividing the total amount spent on books by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah distributed the books equally among her 4 children, we can find the number of books each child received by dividing the total number of books by 4.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle allows us to find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtracting the number allergic to both to avoid double-counting.

The number of kids allergic to dairy is 9, and the number allergic to peanuts is 6. However, 3 kids are allergic to both, so we must subtract this number to avoid counting them twice. Therefore, the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts is 9 + 6 - 3 = 12.

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class, which is 32.

32 (total kids) - 12 (kids allergic to dairy or peanuts) = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides by multiplying the number of groups by the number of tour guides per group: 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

Finally, we add the total number of employees and tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour: 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people.

The final answer is: 621"
"To determine the total cost of the trip, we first need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for two people is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price of $1500 per day. To find the new price, we calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. Adding this to the normal price, we get $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. Given that it is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Let's denote the weight of the 1959 penny as W. Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, its weight can be expressed as (3/4)W.

We are given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. Therefore, we can substitute W = 48 into the expression for the weight of the 2010 penny:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we simply add the weights of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
= 48 + 36
= 84 grains

"To determine the cost of Jillian's handbag, we can establish a relationship between the cost of the handbag and the cost of her shoes. Let's denote the cost of the shoes as S and the cost of the handbag as H.

Given that the handbag costs $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes, we can express this relationship as:

H = 3S - 20

We are also given that the cost of the shoes is $80. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

H = 3(80) - 20
H = 240 - 20
H = 220

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

"To determine the total hours James runs in a week, we first need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week. Given that he runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, we can find this by multiplying the daily miles by the number of days.

Total miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
= 60 miles/week

Now, we can find the total hours James runs in a week by dividing the total miles run in a week by his speed of 10 miles per hour.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we must first calculate the total amount of oats consumed by his horses in a day. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, resulting in a daily consumption of 5 * 2 = 10 pounds per horse.

With four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds. To find the total consumption for five days, we multiply this amount by 5, yielding 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total consumption by the weight of a single bag to find the number of bags needed: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F."
"To determine the number of days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first. The child already has $4 in savings and the toy car costs $12. 

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we can calculate the number of days it will take to save the remaining amount by dividing it by the daily savings of $2.

Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

"To determine the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

The razors are buy one get one free, so Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors, which costs $4.00. Additionally, she has a $2.00 coupon, resulting in a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"To determine the total number of Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges required for one pie.

Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so she has a total of 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, we can calculate the total number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges per pie: 120 / 3 = 40.

"To determine the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200 plus an additional $5 per guest for food, resulting in a total cost of 200 + 5x. 

The cost of the second venue is a per-person charge of $25, which includes the cost of food.

To find the break-even point, we equate the costs of the two venues:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides of the equation yields:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

10 = x

Therefore, the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting B represent the number of insects Bodhi found. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2.

We are also given that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

The total number of insects collected by the three is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combining like terms, we get 2B + 7 = 43. Subtracting 7 from both sides gives us 2B = 36. Dividing both sides by 2 yields B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"To determine the length of the couch, we first need to establish the width of the rug. Given that the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, we can calculate the rug's width as follows:

Rug's width = Chair's width + 5
Rug's width = 3 + 5
Rug's width = 8 feet

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. It is stated that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Therefore, we can calculate the couch's length as follows:

Twice the rug's width = 2 * 8
Twice the rug's width = 16 feet
Couch's length = Twice the rug's width + 2
Couch's length = 16 + 2
Couch's length = 18 feet

"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is half of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

Since the total cost is $7, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood yields the most sticks per dollar. 

Let's calculate the number of sticks per dollar for each type of wood. A 2 x 4 piece of wood gives 200 sticks and costs $4, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50. On the other hand, a 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks and costs $6, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67.

Since 66.67 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we must first calculate the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has four legs and Mario has six dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Given that each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To determine the weekly cost of Janet's bus trips, we can calculate the product of the cost of a single bus trip and the number of trips she takes in a week.

The cost of a single bus trip is $2.20, and Janet takes 5 trips per week. Therefore, the total weekly cost of her bus trips is $2.20 * 5 = $11.00.

Now, we can compare this to the cost of a weekly bus pass, which is $20. To find the amount Janet would save by purchasing the weekly pass, we subtract the cost of the bus trips from the cost of the pass: $20 - $11.00 = $9.00.

"To determine the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo, we need to establish the number of animals at each location. 

First, we are given that the farm has 30 cows. However, we are also informed that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Therefore, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

Next, we are told that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 80 animals.

To find the combined total, we add the number of animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, and she bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:

x + y = 4(x + y)

However, this equation is not necessary to solve the problem. We can directly use the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. This means that the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 1/4 of the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.

The total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 1/4 of 16, which is:

16/4 = 4

So, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes.

"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total distance she will run. Given that she is required to run 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, we can find the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink by multiplying the total distance by the amount of water she needs to drink per kilometer.

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the amount of money Julie had left after her purchases, we can break down the problem into two steps.

First, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes. This is 20% of her initial $500. To find 20% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.2. So, 20% of $500 is 0.2 * $500 = $100. Subtracting this from the initial amount, we get $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, we need to calculate the amount she spent on CDs, which is 25% of the remaining $400. To find 25% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.25. So, 25% of $400 is 0.25 * $400 = $100. Subtracting this from the remaining amount, we get $400 - $100 = $300.

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house can be represented as 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000. To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4, resulting in x = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can calculate the cost of the house by multiplying 3 by 30,000, which equals 90,000.

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000."
"To determine the profit earned on the canvas bags, we first need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost can be found by multiplying the number of packs of bags by the number of bags per pack and the cost per pack. In this case, there are 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. Therefore, the total cost is 8 * 5 * $4 = $160.

Next, we calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of bags sold by the selling price per bag. Tara sold each bag for $8, and she sold a total of 8 * 5 = 40 bags. Thus, the total revenue is 40 * $8 = $320.

The profit is then calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total duration of the fight and then multiply it by his average punching rate.

The fight consists of 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes. Therefore, the total duration of the fight is 5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes.

Given that Joe throws 25 punches per minute, we can calculate the total number of punches by multiplying the total duration by his punching rate: 15 minutes * 25 punches/minute = 375 punches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{375}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of cookies made by each individual. Let's denote the number of cookies made by Josh as J, the number of cookies made by Kelsie as K, and the number of cookies made by Suzanne as S.

We are given that Suzanne made 36 cookies, so S = 36. We are also given that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, which can be expressed as J = S / 4. Substituting the value of S, we get J = 36 / 4 = 9.

Now, we are told that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This can be expressed as K = 2J. Substituting the value of J, we get K = 2 * 9 = 18.

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Ali initially has. He possesses four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total money from the $10 bills is 4 * $10 = $40, and the total money from the $20 bills is 6 * $20 = $120. Therefore, the total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Next, Ali gives his sister half of the total money. Half of the total money is $160 / 2 = $80. Consequently, the amount of money left after giving his sister half is $160 - $80 = $80.

Finally, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of the remaining money, we multiply $80 by 3/5, which equals $48. Therefore, the amount of money left after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

The final numerical answer is: $32"
"To determine the time it takes Royce to shingle a house, we first need to convert Rob's time from hours to minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we can calculate this as 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Given that Royce takes double the time it takes Rob plus 40 minutes, we can express this relationship as an equation: Royce's time = (2 * Rob's time) + 40 minutes.

Substituting Rob's time (120 minutes) into the equation, we get: Royce's time = (2 * 120) + 40 = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

Therefore, the time it takes Royce to shingle a house is 280 minutes.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we must calculate the total for each item and then sum these values.

First, let's consider the number of skeins required for each type of garment. 

- Hats: 3 children * 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 children * 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 children * 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 children * 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 children * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins

Now, we can calculate the total number of skeins needed by summing the values for each item:
6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins

The final answer is: 63"
"To determine the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems. On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. Therefore, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of problems Chris has to complete is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems. So, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

The number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 100 - 61 = 39.

The final answer is: $\boxed{39}$"
"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm, we need to calculate the individual rates at which each of them can pick strawberries and then sum these rates.

Tony's rate is given as 6 quarts per hour. 

Bobby's rate is one quart less than Tony's, so it is 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy's rate is twice that of Bobby's, which is 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky's rate is two quarts less than Kathy's, so it is 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we can sum the individual rates to find the total rate at which they can pick strawberries per hour: 6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread left, we need to calculate the total number of loaves sold and then subtract that from the initial number of loaves baked.

The bakery sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, for a total of 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold.

Additionally, the grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. To find the total number of loaves left, we need to subtract both the number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the initial number of loaves baked.

Total loaves left = Initial loaves baked - (Loaves sold + Loaves returned)
Total loaves left = 200 - (132 + 6)
Total loaves left = 200 - 138
Total loaves left = 62

The number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"To determine the number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for each color of tulip separately and then sum the results.

For the red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 36 / 6 = 6.

For the blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 24 / 8 = 3.

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins required for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find the total number of cups of raisins allocated to the granola and snack mix. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the three items, each of them will receive 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, we can find the number of cups of raisins remaining for the oatmeal cookies by subtracting the amount allocated to the granola and snack mix from the total number of cups of raisins: 27 - 9 = 18 cups.

Next, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins remaining for the oatmeal cookies by the amount of raisins required for each batch of cookies. Since a batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we can calculate the number of batches as follows:

18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24

Therefore, Heather can make 24 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Adding a device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour will increase her daily consumption to 14 kilowatts per hour. 

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. Before adding the device, her weekly consumption is 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour. After adding the device, her weekly consumption is 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour.

Given that a kilowatt per hour costs $1.50, we can calculate the weekly cost by multiplying the weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt hour. The weekly cost before adding the device is 84 * $1.50 = $126. The weekly cost after adding the device is 98 * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we first need to establish the rate at which one person paints a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate their rate as follows:

Rate = 0.5 house / 5 days = 0.1 house per day

Since 5 people are working together, their combined rate is 5 times the rate of one person:

Combined rate = 5 * 0.1 house per day = 0.5 house per day

Now, we can calculate the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house:

Time = 1 house / 0.5 house per day = 2 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert the time from days to hours:

Time = 2 days * 24 hours per day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as C and the number of sofas as S. We are given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so we can express this as S = C - 2.

We are also given that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, which can be expressed as J = 3C, where J is the number of chairs Jenna has. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can express the number of sofas Jenna has as J - 2.

Given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can substitute this value into the equation S = C - 2 to find the number of chairs Ophelia has: 20 = C - 2, which gives us C = 22.

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has by multiplying this value by 3: J = 3 * 22 = 66.

To find the number of sofas Jenna has, we subtract 2 from the number of chairs she has: J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64.

Now that we have the number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna, we can calculate the total number of pieces of furniture they have. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, for a total of 20 + 22 = 42 pieces. Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, for a total of 64 + 66 = 130 pieces.

The total number of sofas and chairs is the sum of the total number of pieces Ophelia and Jenna have: 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to purchase the headphone set, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he spent on the headphone set.

Given that Tom spent a total of $48 and the CD costs $4, the amount spent on the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

Total money spent = $48
Money spent on the CD = $4
Money spent on the headphone set = Total money spent - Money spent on the CD
Money spent on the headphone set = $48 - $4
Money spent on the headphone set = $44

Next, we can calculate the number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Money spent on the headphone set = $44
Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = Money spent on the headphone set / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought = $44 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 11

Now, we can calculate the number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CD.

Total money = $48
Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = Total money / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought = $48 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 12

To find the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to purchase the headphone set, we subtract the number of CDs he actually bought from the number of CDs he could have bought.

Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = Number of CDs that could have been bought - Number of CDs that could have been bought
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 11 - 1
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the varying hours he spent each week. There are 8 weeks in total, but Josh did not spend 4 hours every week. 

He spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks, which accounts for 2 weeks. Additionally, he spent 6 hours in one week. This leaves us with 5 weeks where he spent 4 hours.

First, we calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours: 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 5 hours: 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours.

Lastly, we calculate the total hours for the week where he spent 6 hours: 1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours.

Now, we add up the total hours: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

However, this is not the only possible solution. Another possibility is that the two weeks with 5 hours and the week with 6 hours occurred consecutively, leaving 5 weeks with 4 hours. In this case, the total hours would be: 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours, 1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours, and 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours. The total hours in this scenario would be 20 + 6 + 10 = 36 hours.

However, there is another possibility where the week with 6 hours occurred before the two weeks with 5 hours, and the remaining 5 weeks had 4 hours. In this case, the total hours would be: 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours, 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours, and 1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours. The total hours in this scenario would be 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

There is also the possibility that the week with 6 hours occurred before the two weeks with 5 hours, and the remaining 5 weeks had 4 hours. In this case, the total hours would be: 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours, 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours, and 1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours. The total hours in this scenario would be 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Next, we need to determine the number of passengers who get on at the second stop. It is stated that 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 21 passengers got off, 3 times this number is 3 * 21 = 63. However, this represents the difference between the number of passengers who got off and the number who got on. Since we are looking for the number of passengers who got on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. This results in -42. However, a negative number of passengers is not feasible, so we interpret this as 63 more passengers got on.

Therefore, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables. Let's denote Jame's current age as J and his cousin's current age as C.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is J = 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. This can be expressed as C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5.

Now, we can substitute the value of J into the second equation:
C + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5
C + 8 = 2(30) - 5
C + 8 = 60 - 5
C + 8 = 55
C = 55 - 8
C = 47

Now that we have the current ages of Jame and his cousin, we can find the difference between their ages:
Difference = J - C
          = 22 - 47
          = -25

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference:
Difference = | -25 |
          = 25

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we can start by determining the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, and the computer costs $1,100, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now that we know the cost of the printer, we can find the total cost of the computer and the printer by adding their individual costs:

Total cost of computer and printer = Cost of computer + Cost of printer
= $1,100 + $700
= $1,800

Given that the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and the printer from the overall total:

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Total cost of computer and printer
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys and each brought 60 shells, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

Next, we need to calculate the number of seashells brought by the girls. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as 60 + 4 * 60. 

First, we calculate 4 * 60, which equals 240. Then, we add 60 to this result, giving us 300. Therefore, the girls brought 300 more seashells than the boys.

To find the total number of seashells brought by the girls, we add the number of seashells brought by the boys to the additional seashells brought by the girls. This gives us 600 + 300 = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the initial relationship between the number of candies Nick and George have. Let's denote the number of candies George has as x. Since Nick has twice as many candies as George, the number of candies Nick has can be expressed as 2x.

Next, we are given that George ate 5 candies, resulting in him having 3 candies left. This can be represented as x - 5 = 3. To find the value of x, we can solve this equation by adding 5 to both sides, yielding x = 8.

Now that we know George has 8 candies initially, we can determine the number of candies Nick has by substituting x into the expression 2x. Therefore, Nick has 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Anne's age, we first need to establish Alyana's age, as it is given that she is 4 years younger than Chenny. Given that Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we can determine Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age, as it is stated that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book individually and then sum them up.

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 = 81
81 + 45 = 126
126 + 62 = 188

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her monthly goal, we can calculate the difference between her target and the vlogs she has already created.

Emma's monthly target is 72 vlogs. She has made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. To find the total number of vlogs she has created so far, we add these values together:

18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, we subtract the total number of vlogs she has made from her monthly target to find the number of vlogs she needs to create:

72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma needs to create 18 more vlogs to meet her monthly goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the total amount you paid, we need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. This can be done by multiplying the bill by 0.20.

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, we add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount you paid.

Total amount = $50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

Therefore, you ended up paying $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of steps.

First, we need to determine the eldest boy's initial share of the $18. Since the $18 is shared among 3 boys, we can calculate his initial share as follows:

Initial share = Total amount / Number of boys
Initial share = $18 / 3
Initial share = $6

Next, we need to find the amount the eldest boy has after adding $5 to his initial share and then adding another $10 the following day.

Amount after adding $5 = Initial share + $5
Amount after adding $5 = $6 + $5
Amount after adding $5 = $11

Amount after adding $10 = Amount after adding $5 + $10
Amount after adding $10 = $11 + $10
Amount after adding $10 = $21

Now, we need to find the amount the eldest boy has after spending $8 from his total.

Amount after spending $8 = Amount after adding $10 - $8
Amount after spending $8 = $21 - $8
Amount after spending $8 = $13

Finally, we need to find the amount the eldest boy has after tripling the amount he had left after spending the $8.

Amount after tripling = Amount after spending $8 * 3
Amount after tripling = $13 * 3
Amount after tripling = $39

The final answer is: $39"
"To determine the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we can start by setting up an equation based on his monthly saving target of $1125.

Let's denote the number of days in the first half of April as x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

We are given that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. If we let y be the amount saved in the first half, then the amount saved in the second half will be 2y.

The total amount saved in the first half is xy, and the total amount saved in the second half is 2xy. Therefore, the total amount saved in the month is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

Since Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, we can set up the equation 3xy = 1125.

We also know that the total number of days in April is 30, so we can write the equation x + (30 - x) = 30, which simplifies to 30 = 30. However, this equation does not provide any useful information. Instead, we can use the fact that the total number of days in April is 30 to find the value of x. Since x is the number of days in the first half, we can write x = 30 / 2 = 15.

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the equation 3xy = 1125 to find y: 3(15)y = 1125, which simplifies to 45y = 1125.

To find y, we divide both sides by 45: y = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the change Verna received after purchasing fruits, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the amount she gave.

The cost of three apples at $1.50 each is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of five oranges at $0.80 each is 5 * $0.80 = $4.
The cost of six peaches at $0.75 each is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we need to calculate their individual totals and then find the difference.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, and he completed 20 tasks. Therefore, his total earnings can be calculated as follows:
Jairus' total = 0.8 * 20 = $16

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, and she also completed 20 tasks. Her total earnings can be calculated as follows:
Jenny's total = 0.5 * 20 = $10

Now, we can find the difference between Jairus' total and Jenny's total to determine how much more Jairus will earn than Jenny.
Difference = Jairus' total - Jenny's total = 16 - 10 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be represented as 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of their shares is 100. This can be expressed as:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 20

Now that we know Brad's share, we can find Jeff's share by multiplying x by 4:

Jeff's share = 4x = 4 * 20 = 80

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the total distance Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total distance he walks each day is twice the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Given that he works 5 times a week, the total distance he walks in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 miles.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the process into manageable steps.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which yields 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters. 

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters. 

Then, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is the sum of the letters from the first two steps: 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters she has written is 65 + 65 = 130.

"To determine the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we can analyze the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, 3 families are notified directly by Ali. 
In the second round, each of these 3 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified, for a total of 3 + 9 = 12 families.
In the third round, each of the 9 families from the second round notifies 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified, for a total of 12 + 27 = 39 families.
In the fourth round, each of the 27 families from the third round notifies 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families being notified.

Therefore, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

The final answer is: $\boxed{81}$"
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during his illness. Since he lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, the total weight lost can be calculated as follows:

Total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months
Total weight lost = 30 pounds

Now, we can find Mark's initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we first need to calculate the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can find this total by multiplying 80 by 5.

80 * 5 = 400

Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"To determine the total cost of the items Daniel wants to purchase, we first need to calculate the cost of each item individually.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50. 
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is 1 * $12 = $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is 1 * $10 = $10.

The total cost of all the items before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To find the discount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost. 
10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Daniel has to spend: $30 - $3 = $27.

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two categories: the initial $1000 and the sales exceeding $1000.

The commission for the initial $1000 is 30% of $1000, which can be calculated as 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For the sales exceeding $1000, we first need to determine the amount of sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.

The additional commission for the sales exceeding $1000 is 10% of $1500, which can be calculated as 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

To find the total commission, we add the commission for the initial $1000 and the additional commission for the sales exceeding $1000: $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, the total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of bottles required for his party. Since he wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles needed for the guests is 70 * 2 = 140.

Bill initially has 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. Therefore, he already has a total of 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

To find the number of additional bottles needed, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles required: 140 (for guests) - 48 (he already has) = 92.

The final answer is: 92"
"To determine the time difference in swimming 3 miles between a cold day and a hot day, we first need to establish the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in each condition.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as the time it takes in cold water. 

The time to swim a mile in warm water can be calculated as follows: 2 * 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions. 

In cold water, the time to swim 3 miles is 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. In warm water, the time to swim 3 miles is 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between the two conditions is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To determine the number of cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we first need to establish the amount he currently consumes. 

Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as x. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, her daily intake is x/2. Given that Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, his daily intake is 10 * (x/2) = 5x.

We are informed that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. Therefore, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters: 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters.

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs: 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we first need to determine their individual weights. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so her weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 

Bob's weight is twice that of Susan's, which is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the three friends by adding their individual weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3. Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

"To determine the final angle from the ground to the sun, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the sun's movement. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves 5 degrees per hour relative to Sahir's house.

Given that the sun moves at a constant rate of 5 degrees per hour, we can calculate the total angle it moves in 10 hours by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours.

Angle moved by the sun = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours
= 50 degrees

Now, we can find the final angle from the ground to the sun by adding the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle moved by the sun.

Final angle from the ground to the sun = Initial angle + Angle moved by the sun
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

"To determine the total amount James spends on candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles required. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 8 years old.

The total number of candles needed is the sum of their ages, which is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Given that a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can calculate the number of packs needed by dividing the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles is then 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week by finding out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Therefore, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the number of sandwiches left, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor. 

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is equivalent to 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is equivalent to 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches eaten is the sum of the sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor, which is 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.
This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.
This simplifies to x = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for each set of teeth and add them together.

For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left a fixed amount of $5.00.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left a constant amount of $1.00 each, resulting in a total of 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. Therefore, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we need to determine the number of goals scored by each of them. 

Let's start by analyzing the information given. We know that Richie scored 80 goals. Additionally, we are told that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna.

From the first piece of information, we can express Mark's goals as 80 - 20 = 60. This is because Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.

Similarly, we can express Anna's goals as 80 - 45 = 35. This is because Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.

Now that we have the number of goals scored by each of the teenagers, we can find the total number of goals scored by adding their individual scores together.

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Liam and Mitchell, we first need to calculate the total amount each individual made from selling lemonades.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so his total earnings can be calculated as the product of the number of lemonades sold and the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = $84.

Now, we can find the difference in earnings by subtracting Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings: 84 - 63 = 21.

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam selling lemonade that weekend.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and add them up.

First, let's consider the wooden action figures. Peter spent $5 each day on these figures from Sunday through Wednesday, which is a total of 4 days. The total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 * $5 = $20. Since he spent $20, he bought 20 / 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

Next, we need to calculate the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left. He has 5 days left (Thursday through Saturday), and each plastic action figure costs $2. The total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 50 / 2 = 25.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the total cost associated with Leah's kitten, we must consider the expenses incurred. The initial cost of spaying the kitten is $200. Additionally, the kitten required 3 vaccinations, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for vaccinations is 3 * $20 = $60.

Furthermore, the kitten's mischievous behavior resulted in the breaking of 4 vases, each valued at $12. Consequently, the total cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

To obtain the overall cost, we must sum the individual expenses: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccinations) + $48 (broken vases) = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. Therefore, the total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the remaining balance in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount withdrawn from the account over this period.

There are 24 months in 2 years, as each year consists of 12 months. Given that Katina removes $100 from her account every month, the total amount withdrawn in 24 months is 24 * $100 = $2400.

The initial balance in Katina's account is $3000. To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial balance: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To determine the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf yields 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich.

The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. To find the cost per sandwich, we divide the total cost by the number of sandwiches: $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese and condiments: $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.

The food truck sells each sandwich for $7.00. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of sandwiches sold by the selling price: 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00.

The total cost is the cost per sandwich multiplied by the number of sandwiches sold: $3.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine the total amount of money Kate can make from selling her muffin crayons, we need to calculate the total number of muffin crayons she can create and then multiply that number by the price of each muffin crayon.

First, we calculate the total number of crayons Kate has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, the total number of crayons is 3 * 64 = 192.

Next, we need to find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make. Since she melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin crayon, the total number of muffin crayons she can make is 192 / 8 = 24.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Kate can make by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon. The price of each muffin crayon is $1.50, so the total amount of money Kate can make is 24 * $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom, we need to calculate the area of the room and the costs associated with the materials and labor.

First, we calculate the area of the room by multiplying its length and width: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of the materials is $2592 + $432 + $864 = $3888.

The total cost of the labor is $864 + $7344 = $8208.

The total cost to replace the carpet is $3888 + $8208 = $12196.

The final answer is: $12196"
"To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to determine the total number of birds he observed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

The total number of birds seen on days 1 and 2 is 50. On day 3, Mack saw no birds. On days 4 and 5, he observed 120 birds. On day 6, he saw 20 birds, and on day 7, he saw 90 birds.

First, we calculate the total number of birds seen over the week by adding the birds seen on each day: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90.

50 + 0 = 50
50 + 120 = 170
170 + 20 = 190
190 + 90 = 280

The total number of birds seen over the week is 280. Since there are 7 days in the week, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days to find the average number of birds seen per day.

Average birds per day = Total birds seen / Number of days
Average birds per day = 280 / 7
Average birds per day = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the final value of the number train, we can break down the given operations step by step.

First, we start with the initial value of 20. 

Next, we calculate half of this value, which is 20 / 2 = 10.

Then, we add the initial value to this result, yielding 20 + 10 = 30.

After that, we divide the sum by 5, giving us 30 / 5 = 6.

Finally, we multiply this result by the initial value minus 12, which is 20 - 12 = 8. Therefore, the final value is 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To determine the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together, we first need to establish the number of cards each of them possesses.

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does, which can be calculated as 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of cards the boy and his brother have together: 5 + 2 = 7.

"To find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off. This can be calculated by finding the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then dividing it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual and set temperatures is 468 - 450 = 18. 

Now, we can calculate the percentage by which the oven is off: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4%, to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to subtract 4% of 520 from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The temperature Maggie should set the oven to is 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature Maggie should set the oven to is 499.

The final answer is: 499"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then sum them.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour to 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives us 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{215}$"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

Herb's house price is $76,000. To find 30% of this value, we multiply it by 0.3. This gives us 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800. 

Now, we can find Juan's house price by subtracting 30% of Herb's house price from Herb's house price. This is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, we add Herb's house price and Juan's house price together. This gives us $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To determine the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we first need to establish the quantities of cups and dishes each of them brought.

Judy purchased a dozen cups, which is equivalent to 12 cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she acquired 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend, on the other hand, brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. This means her friend had 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Total Judy brought: 12 + 24 = 36

Next, we calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 
Friend's cups: 40
Friend's dishes: 44
Total friend brought: 40 + 44 = 84

To find the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend, we add the quantities together: 
Total Judy brought: 36
Total friend brought: 84
Total brought by both: 36 + 84 = 120

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have. Given that 90 single-use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day by dividing the total number of contacts by the number of days they last.

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of 2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts.

To find the total number of days the contacts will last, we divide the total number of contacts by the number of contacts used per day:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the contacts. The original price of 2 boxes is $200, and there is a 10% discount. The discount amount is 10% of $200, which is $20. Therefore, the total cost of the contacts is $200 - $20 = $180.

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:
$180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we first need to calculate their individual earnings. Jill worked a total of 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, which sums to 3 hours. Given her hourly wage of $10, her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John's work hours can be calculated by doubling Jill's Saturday hours (2 hours * 2 = 4 hours) and tripling her Sunday hours (1 hour * 3 = 3 hours). Therefore, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories burned during her activities. 

Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour. Therefore, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories. 

Additionally, she spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour. Thus, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of the calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can determine the total amount of water she needs to drink by dividing the total calories burned by 200 and then multiplying by 100.

First, we divide 1600 by 200, which equals 8. Then, we multiply 8 by 100, resulting in 800.

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as R = 0.99B. Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so G = 1.01B.

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500. Combining like terms, we have 3.01B = 4500.

To solve for B, we divide both sides of the equation by 3.01, which gives us B = 1500.

Now that we know the value of B, we can find the values of R and G. Substituting B = 1500 into the expressions for R and G, we get R = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485 and G = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"

"To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

Let's start by calculating the weight change for each option. If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds per week. If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds per week.

To find the total weight change after 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly weight change by 5.

Weight change for eating Cheerios: -1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds
Weight change for eating donuts: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Now, we need to find the difference in weight between the two options. To do this, we subtract the weight gained from the weight lost.

Difference in weight: -6.25 pounds - 8.75 pounds = -6.25 - 8.75 = -15 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{-15}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to consider the number of people invited via email and the number of people invited by Alex's friends.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Alex invites 100 people, and each of them invites 2 friends. This results in a total of 100 + (100 * 2) = 300 people invited via email.

Next, we need to consider the number of people invited by Alex's friends. She calls 10 friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses. This means that 10 friends and 8 spouses are attending, for a total of 18 people.

To find the total number of people attending, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of people invited by Alex's friends: 300 + 18 = 318. However, this count includes Alex herself, so we need to add 1 to the total to account for her.

Therefore, the total number of people attending the event is 318 + 1 = 319.

"To determine the number of days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we can model the situation using exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles in height every day. We want to find the number of days, n, such that the height of the beanstalk exceeds 20 feet.

The height of the beanstalk on the nth day can be represented by the equation: h(n) = 4 * 2^n, where h(n) is the height of the beanstalk on the nth day.

We want to find the smallest value of n such that h(n) > 20. This can be expressed as:

4 * 2^n > 20

Dividing both sides by 4 gives:

2^n > 5

To solve for n, we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides:

n > log2(5)

Using a calculator, we find that log2(5) ≈ 2.3219. Since n must be an integer (we can't have a fraction of a day), the smallest value of n that satisfies the inequality is n = 3.

However, we need to verify that the beanstalk is indeed taller than 20 feet on the 3rd day. Plugging in n = 3 into the equation h(n) = 4 * 2^n, we get:

h(3) = 4 * 2^3 = 4 * 8 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount of protein John consumes per week from mushrooms, we first need to establish the protein content per unit of weight in the mushrooms. Given that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein percentage as follows:

Protein percentage = (Protein content / Weight) * 100
Protein percentage = (3 grams / 100 grams) * 100
Protein percentage = 3%

Now, we know that John consumes 200 grams of mushrooms daily. To find the daily protein intake, we can multiply the weight of mushrooms consumed by the protein percentage:

Daily protein intake = Weight of mushrooms consumed * Protein percentage
Daily protein intake = 200 grams * 0.03
Daily protein intake = 6 grams

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the weekly protein intake by multiplying the daily protein intake by 7:

Weekly protein intake = Daily protein intake * 7
Weekly protein intake = 6 grams * 7
Weekly protein intake = 42 grams

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we must first calculate the total cost of the procedure. The base price of each implant is $2000, and since he requires two implants, the total base cost is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

However, he also wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which adds an additional $500 to the total cost. Therefore, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Given that he earns $15 per hour at work, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work to cover the remaining cost by dividing the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

The sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the total amount of money Colby has, we need to calculate the value of his coins in cents. 

8 quarters are equivalent to 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents.
6 dimes are equivalent to 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents.
14 nickels are equivalent to 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents.
15 pennies are equivalent to 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents.

The total amount of money Colby has is the sum of the values of his coins: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can find the number of gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

"To determine the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the initial 8-pound weight by 50%, we first need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. This can be done by multiplying 8 pounds by 0.5, which yields 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to the initial 8 pounds results in a weight of 12 pounds. However, Jamaal finds this weight to be too heavy and decides to use a weight that is two pounds lighter. Therefore, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds to find the final weight.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he receives each year and sum them up.

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. Additionally, he purchases 1 game per month for 12 months, resulting in 12 games. Therefore, in the first year, Steve receives a total of 10 + 12 = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He purchases 2 games per month for 12 months, resulting in 24 games. Consequently, in the second year, Steve receives a total of 5 + 24 = 29 games.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He purchases 4 games per month for 12 months, resulting in 48 games. Therefore, in the third year, Steve receives a total of 5 + 48 = 53 games.

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we sum the number of games he receives each year: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games.

"To determine the time it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to calculate the plane's rate of travel. This can be done by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in a day, we first need to calculate their individual hourly production rates and then their combined production rate for 12 hours.

Ruiz's production rate can be calculated by dividing the total amount of chocolates he makes in two hours by 2. Given that he produces 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, his hourly production rate is 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa's production rate is 3/4 times Ruiz's hourly production rate. Since Ruiz produces 60 pounds of chocolates per hour, Marissa's production rate is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates produced by each individual in 12 hours. Ruiz's total production is 60 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds, and Marissa's total production is 45 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.

The combined total production of Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours is 720 pounds (Ruiz) + 540 pounds (Marissa) = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"

"To determine the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to calculate the total revenue from each period and then sum them together.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the initial four hours. During this period, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup. The total number of cups sold in this period is 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups. Consequently, the total revenue from this period is 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

Next, we'll calculate the revenue from the subsequent two hours. In this period, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup. The total number of cups sold in this period is 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups. Therefore, the total revenue from this period is 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

To find the total revenue from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we add the revenue from the two periods together: $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the lifespan of the tires in years, we first need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires can undergo in a month. Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles per month, we can find the monthly rotations as follows:

Monthly rotations = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile
Monthly rotations = 290,000 rotations/month

Next, we need to find out how many months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. We know that each tire can undergo a total of 10,440,000 rotations.

Total months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Total months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 290,000
Total months before replacement = 36

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = Total months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 36 / 12
Years before replacement = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the cost per pump of the shampoo, we first need to establish the total number of pumps in the bottle. Given that 2 pumps yield 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

"To determine the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract it from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price, which is $25. To find 30% of $25, we multiply $25 by 0.3:
$25 * 0.3 = $7.5

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt by subtracting the discount from the original price:
$25 - $7.5 = $17.5

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the items. The total cost is the sum of the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts:
$17.5 + $35 = $52.5

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately. Now, let's subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Joe has:
$50 - $52.5 = -$2.5

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.5"
"To determine the total amount of butter needed to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to produce. Since there are 4 dozen croissants per day and 7 days in a week, the total number of croissants is:

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Converting this to individual croissants, we multiply by 12 (since there are 12 croissants in a dozen):

28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we need to find the total amount of butter required. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:

336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To determine the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and sum them together.

First, let's consider the cost of the aquarium, which was purchased for $10.00. 

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the rocks. Two bags of rocks at $2.50 each will be 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.

The cost of the coral is also a factor. Three pieces of coral at $2.00 each will be 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.

We must also account for the cost of the fish. Twenty fish at $0.50 each will be 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.

In addition to the fish, Scarlett purchased fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together:
$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we first calculate the total number of seats available. Given that there are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row, the total number of seats is:

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we find the number of seats occupied by the administrators, which is one-fourth of the total seats.

Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are then occupied by the parents and the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the parents, we calculate one-third of the remaining seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats
Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Now, we can find the number of students by subtracting the number of parents from the remaining seats.

Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

First, we calculate the number of pieces he chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, we divide the total school hours by 2 to find the number of pieces he chews at school: 8 / 2 = 4.

In addition to the pieces he chews at school, Jim also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. Therefore, the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day is 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6.

Initially, Jim has 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

However, Jim's sister asks for half of the remaining gum before bed. To find out how many pieces she takes, we divide the remaining gum by 2: 14 / 2 = 7.

Therefore, Jim's sister takes 7 pieces, leaving Jim with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

"To determine the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers. Given that there are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers is the product of these two quantities.

The total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can find the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by 4/5.

To perform this calculation, we can multiply the numerator (4) by the total number of flowers (200) and then divide the result by the denominator (5).

4 * 200 = 800

Now, we divide 800 by 5 to find the number of bloomed flowers.

"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and his current height, and then divide that by his annual growth rate.

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches, as Adam's height is given in inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the required height of 4 feet is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we can calculate the difference in height: 48 inches (required height) - 40 inches (Adam's current height) = 8 inches.

Given that Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can find the number of years it will take for him to reach the required height by dividing the difference in height by his growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the required height and ride the roller coaster.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the prices of the gold and silver jewels in relation to the diamond jewel.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can express the price of the gold jewel as a multiple of the diamond jewel's price. Since the price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of the diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Next, we are told that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

"To determine the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the relative speed between them. This can be calculated by subtracting Bob's speed from Tom's speed, as the relative speed is the rate at which the distance between them decreases.

Given that Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, the relative speed is 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.

Now, we can use the formula Time = Distance / Relative Speed to find the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob. The distance between them is 75 miles.

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of fish caught by each individual. Let's denote the number of fish caught by Naomi as N, Darren as D, and Tommy as T.

We are given that Naomi caught 17 fish, so N = 17.

We are also given that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, which can be expressed as D = N - 6.

Substituting the value of N, we get D = 17 - 6 = 11.

Lastly, we are told that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, which can be expressed as T = D + 3.

Substituting the value of D, we get T = 11 + 3 = 14.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes attended at $6 per class as x and the number of classes attended at $10 per class as y. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

The equation representing this situation is 6x + 10y = 60.

Since we want to find the maximum number of classes Manny can attend at $6 per class, we can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

We can rewrite the equation as 6x = 60 - 10y.

Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 10 - (5/3)y.

Since x must be a whole number, 10 - (5/3)y must also be a whole number. This means that (5/3)y must be an integer.

To find the maximum value of x, we can try different values of y. 

If y = 3, (5/3)y = 5, which is an integer. Substituting this value into the equation x = 10 - (5/3)y, we get x = 10 - 5 = 5.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can attend at $6 per class is 5.

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to calculate their individual daily and weekly production rates.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Given that there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, her daily production rate is 50 * 2 = 100 customers. Consequently, Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the distances run by Reggie, Lynn, and Paisley. We are given that Paisley ran 4 miles.

Reggie's distance is 5 times Paisley's distance, which is 5 * 4 = 20 miles. Additionally, Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Let's denote Lynn's distance as L. Therefore, we can express Reggie's distance as L + 3 = 20.

To find Lynn's distance, we need to solve for L. Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation L + 3 = 20 gives us L = 17.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to calculate the cost per unit of each fruit. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of 1 apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. Therefore, the cost of 5 apples is 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.

Similarly, the cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of 1 orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10. Consequently, the cost of 5 oranges is 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole, is given by the formula:

Volume = length * width * depth

Given that the dimensions of the hole are 6 feet in length, 4 feet in width, and 3 feet in depth, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now that we have the volume of the hole, we can calculate the time it will take Bob to dig it. Since it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: $\boxed{216}$"
"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. 

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500. 

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

The final answer is: $43,500"
"To determine Tim's total annual income, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary. This can be done by multiplying $20,000 by 0.05, which represents 5% as a decimal. This gives us $1,000, the amount of the raise.

Next, we add the raise to his original monthly salary to find his new monthly salary: $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $20,000 / 2 = $10,000.

Now, we calculate the total monthly income by adding the new monthly salary and the bonus: $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

Finally, we multiply the total monthly income by 12 to find the total annual income: $31,000 * 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To determine the total cost of James' purchases, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

First, let's find the cost of the suits: 10 suits at $750 each amounts to 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, we calculate the cost of the dress pants. Given that they cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit, we can express this as (1/5) * $750 = $150 per dress pant. Therefore, 10 dress pants will cost 10 * $150 = $1500.

Moving on to the dress shirts, James buys 3 shirts per suit, and since he bought 10 suits, he purchased a total of 10 * 3 = 30 shirts. At $60 per shirt, the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"
"To determine the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. Therefore, the total number of articles published by the news website is 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles.

Similarly, the sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day. With 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles.

Now, we can find the total number of articles published by both websites by adding the total number of articles published by each website: 560 articles (news website) + 280 articles (sister company) = 840 articles.

The final answer is: 840"
"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to determine the ages of Steve and his son first.

Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, so her age is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Since their son is half as old as his mother, we can calculate his age as 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Now, we know that Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. Therefore, her age is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to calculate the total amount of flour in one bag and then multiply it by 3.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can find the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion. This gives us 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we first calculate the distance each individual covered. Alisa biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. Using the formula distance = speed * time, we find that Alisa's distance is 12 * 4.5 = 54 miles.

Similarly, Stanley biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Using the same formula, we find that Stanley's distance is 10 * 2.5 = 25 miles.

To find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we add their individual distances: 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. Therefore, the time it takes to dig through the soil is 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, which means he can dig 2 feet per hour through clay. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay, so the time it takes to dig through the clay is 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, we can find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well by adding the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of individuals in his class. This includes himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. 

The total number of people is therefore 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27.

Since Howie is purchasing two cupcakes for each person, we multiply the total number of people by 2 to find the total number of cupcakes needed.

27 * 2 = 54

Therefore, Howie should purchase 54 cupcakes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her Instagram post. Three weeks later, the number of likes increased to 70 times the initial number of likes. This means the number of likes after 3 weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140000.

However, we are not given the number of likes received in the 3-week period. Instead, we are told that she received 20000 more new likes recently. To find the total number of likes after this recent increase, we need to determine the number of likes after 3 weeks and then add the 20000 new likes.

The number of likes after 3 weeks is 140000. To find the number of likes before the 20000 new likes, we subtract the initial 2000 likes from this total: 140000 - 2000 = 138000.

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the total number of likes after 3 weeks: 138000 + 20000 = 158000.

The final answer is: 158000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two costs.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she received a $2 discount due to a voucher. The total cost is therefore 20 * $20 - $2 = $398.

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate increased to $30, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is 20 * $30 = $600. The discount is 10% of $600, which is $600 * 0.1 = $60. Therefore, the total cost with the discount is $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

The final answer is: $142"
"To determine the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to calculate her sales for each month and then sum them.

Let's start by finding the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats, we can express this as an equation: x/2 = 400, where x represents the total sales from green hats. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us x = 800.

Now that we know the sales from green hats in the first month were $800, we can find the total sales for the first month by adding the sales from red hats: $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, Ariadne's sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the sales in the second month, we multiply the total sales of the first month by 3/4: (3/4) * 1200 = 900.

To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To determine the total cost of hiring the horse-drawn carriage, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the total cost of those hours.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he receives 1 hour of free service, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost of the first hour is $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

Therefore, the total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we can calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received. 

First, let's find the expected total in her account if she received her full wage. 

Expected wage: $300
Initial amount in the account: $200
Expected total: $300 + $200 = $500

Since she actually has $420 in her account, we can find the difference between the expected total and the actual amount to determine the withheld amount.

Actual amount: $420
Expected total: $500
Withheld amount: $500 - $420 = $80

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs for her party, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves her guests will consume. Given that each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, we can find the total number of deviled egg halves by multiplying the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves per guest.

Total deviled egg halves = Number of guests * Number of deviled egg halves per guest
Total deviled egg halves = 16 * 3
Total deviled egg halves = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we can find the total number of eggs required by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

Total eggs = Total deviled egg halves / 2
Total eggs = 48 / 2
Total eggs = 24

To find the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen.

Number of dozens of eggs = Total eggs / 12
Number of dozens of eggs = 24 / 12
Number of dozens of eggs = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To determine the number of days before the deadline that Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the time it will take him to complete the book. 

Given that Mike plans to read 10 pages a day, we can find the number of days required to finish the 200-page book by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads daily.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can find the number of days before the deadline by subtracting the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish the book

"To determine the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly hanger rental is $5,000. To find the total hanger rental cost for a year, we multiply this by 12, the number of months in a year: $5,000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $10,000. To find the total fuel cost for a year, we multiply this by 12: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the first year by adding the initial purchase price, the hanger rental cost, and the fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"To determine the total cooking time for Finley's meal, we need to calculate the cooking time for each ingredient and then sum them up.

Let's start by identifying the cooking time for each ingredient. We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. 

The cooking time for pork is 20 minutes more than the cooking time for rice, which is 30 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total cooking time by adding up the cooking times for all the ingredients: 
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

"To determine the cost difference between two mixtures of nuts, we first need to calculate the cost of each mixture. 

Let's start by calculating the cost of almonds and walnuts separately. The cost of almonds is $10 per pound, and the cost of walnuts is $15 per pound.

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. The cost of almonds in this mixture is (1/2) * $10 = $5, and the cost of walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5. Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. The cost of almonds in this mixture is (1/5) * $10 = $2, and the cost of walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5. Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we can find the difference in cost between the two mixtures by subtracting the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

We are given that the total number of animal legs is 70, which can be represented as 4S + 2G = 70. This equation accounts for the fact that each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs.

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20, which can be represented as S + G = 20. This equation accounts for the fact that each sheep and each goose has one head.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut separately.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but since his favorite brand was sold out, he had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 20% of $5, which is 0.2 * $5 = $1. Therefore, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

In addition to the coffee, Roger also bought a donut for $2.

The total cost of Roger's purchase is the sum of the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut, which is $42 + $2 = $44.

"To determine the amount of money each person would have if they decided to add their money together and share it equally, we need to first calculate the amount of money each person has.

Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

Kassidy's money = (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Now, we know that Rayna has 60 dollars more than Kassidy. Therefore, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

Rayna's money = 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

To find the total amount of money, we add the amounts of money each person has:

Total money = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

Finally, to determine the amount of money each person would have if they shared it equally, we divide the total amount by 3:

Money per person = 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

"To find the number of books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

Next, we calculate the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we can find the number of days required for the bamboo to reach 600 inches by dividing the difference by the growth rate of 30 inches per day:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take the bamboo 12 days to reach a height of 600 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, indicating that each dog has 1 toy. With 8 additional dogs in the shelter, James requires 8 more toys to meet the current demand. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12.

Upon his return, the number of dogs in the shelter doubles, increasing from 8 to 16. Consequently, James needs 16 additional toys to accommodate the new dogs. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12 (initial toys) + 16 (additional toys) = 28.

However, when James returns again, 3 dogs are no longer in the shelter, reducing the number of toys needed by 3. Therefore, the total number of toys required is 28 (total toys needed so far) - 3 (toys no longer needed) = 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the amount Skyler invested, we first need to calculate the amount invested by Dylan and then subtract that from the initial investment to find the remaining amount, which will be invested by Frances. We can then subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment.

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * 1200 = 480.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is 1200 - 480 = 720.

Frances' investment is 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * 720 = 480.

The remaining amount after Frances' investment is 720 - 480 = 240.

Therefore, Skyler's investment is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal, we first calculate the total number of signatures they have collected so far. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

The sisters aim to collect a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the total signatures they have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we can calculate the number of signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal.

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of 100 signatures.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine Karen's earnings in two days, we first need to establish her hourly wage. Given that she earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is 2 * $10 = $20.

Next, we calculate the total hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, her total hours worked in two days is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate Karen's total earnings by multiplying her hourly wage by the total hours worked: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to establish the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. Given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can express this relationship as a ratio of 6:36.

To find the number of hash browns that can be produced from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Cross-multiplying, we get:

6x = 96 * 36

Simplifying the equation, we have:

6x = 3456

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can be used to make 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: 576"
"To determine the excess weight, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 9 adults. This can be done by multiplying the weight of one adult by the number of adults.

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Given that the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we can find the excess weight by subtracting the maximum load from the total weight of the 9 adults.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

Let's start by identifying the relationships between the number of cookies each person has. We know that Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina, we can express the number of cookies Max has as 68 + 5 = 73.

Next, we can determine the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as 73 - 12 = 61.

Finally, we can find the number of cookies Summer has. Since Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, we can express the number of cookies Summer has as 73 + 23 = 96.

Now, we can add up the number of cookies each person has to find the total: 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298.

The final answer is: 298"
"To find the original length of the dress, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, which is equivalent to 0.5x. Additionally, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the total added length is 0.5x + 20.

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: x + (0.5x + 20) = 140.

Combine like terms: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120.

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to consider the time it took for each mode and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it took for each mode. The time in turtle mode is 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. The time in rabbit mode is given as 40 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we can find the time for each mode by multiplying the respective time by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we can add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the time remaining after they reach the fire station. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to get to the fire station. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is and an additional 13 minutes to get to the fire station. Therefore, the total time to get to the fire station is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Now, we can find the time remaining by subtracting the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have to get to school. The total time they have is 30 minutes. 

Time remaining = Total time - Time to get to the fire station
Time remaining = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time remaining = 11 minutes

"To determine the number of cookies in the box, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. Greta bakes 30 cookies, while Celinda bakes twice as many, which is 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies is the sum of Greta's and Celinda's cookies, which is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

After eating 10 cookies, the remaining number of cookies in the box can be found by subtracting the number eaten from the total number of cookies: 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

We have two key pieces of information: the sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44, and the older twin is 7 years older than the triplet. This can be represented by the following equations:

1. T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. T+7 = t+7

From the second equation, we can simplify to find the relationship between T and t: T = t.

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, we need to find the age of one of the twins. Given that the older twin is 7 years older than the triplet, we can calculate the age of the older twin as follows:

T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is 19.33.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"
"To determine the amount of time John has available for a nap, we must first calculate the total time he has before dinner. Since John has 3 hours before dinner, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 3 hours by 60 minutes per hour, which yields 180 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the total time John spends on his homework. He has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. Adding these together, we get a total of 80 minutes spent on homework.

Now, we can find the time available for a nap by subtracting the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap."
"To determine the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. Given that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40, we can calculate the cost of the lollipops as 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.

Subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost, we find that the 4 candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. Dividing this by 4 gives us the cost of one candy, which is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops as 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. Similarly, the cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"To determine the amount John leaves with after visiting the vet, we need to calculate the total cost of the services provided. The cost of the vaccines is $20 per vaccine, and since there are two vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. The heartworm check can be expressed as 0.6x. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To isolate 'x', we subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation: 0.4x = $40. Then, we divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for 'x': x = $100.

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can calculate the cost of the heartworm check, which is 60% of $100, or 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: $40 + $60 = $100.

Since John brought $125 with him, the amount he leaves with is $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of its individual components. 

First, let's establish the cost of each type of fruit. Given that one apple costs $0.5, we can infer that one banana costs twice as much, which is 2 * $0.5 = $1. Furthermore, since one orange costs three times as much as a banana, we can calculate its cost as 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and then sum them up.

Let's start by identifying the number of squares of each color. We know that there are 14 red squares. The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares, which is 14 + 4 = 18. Similarly, the number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares, which is 18 + 6 = 24. Lastly, the number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares, which is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total number of squares by adding the number of squares of each color together: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares, which is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of chairs Mia's restaurant needs to obtain, we must first calculate the total number of chairs required for the attendees. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is 57.

The restaurant has 8 high chairs, and it is stated that there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

The total number of chairs available is the sum of the high chairs and the regular chairs, which is 8 + 40 = 48.

To find the number of additional chairs needed, we subtract the total number of available chairs from the total number of chairs required: 57 - 48 = 9.

"To determine the number of 8-point bucks in the field, we first need to calculate the total number of bucks. Since 50 percent of the deer are bucks, we can find this by multiplying the total number of deer by 0.5.

Total deer = 50
Bucks = 0.5 * Total deer
Bucks = 0.5 * 50
Bucks = 25

Next, we need to find 20 percent of the bucks that are 8 points. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of bucks by 0.2.

8-point bucks = 0.2 * Bucks
8-point bucks = 0.2 * 25
8-point bucks = 5

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

"To determine the total points collected by the class, we need to calculate the points earned by each student. 

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 0.3 by 50, which equals 15. Therefore, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Subtracting 30 from 65 gives us 35 points for Tom.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. Multiplying 35 by 3 yields 105 points for Martha.

The total points collected by the class is the sum of the points earned by each student: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

Since the minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold to find the points the class is missing: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

The final answer is: 145"
"To determine the total number of great grand-babies at the family reunion, we can follow the pattern of family relationships.

"To find the capacity of Gary's truck, we can start by determining the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel, and Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which means Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. Since the three trucks can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel, we can find the capacity of Gary's truck by subtracting the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity.

Capacity of Gary's truck = Total capacity - Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks
= 11,600 - 8,800
= 2,800 pounds

"To determine the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to establish the turtle's speed. Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can calculate the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5
The turtle's speed = 3 feet/second

Now, we can use the formula Distance = Speed * Time to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to calculate the amount they need to raise per hour. Given that they have raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, we can find the hourly rate by dividing the total amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. The remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

"To determine the total quarts of ice cream produced in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

First, let's find the production rate of chocolate ice cream. The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the hourly production rate, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

Next, we'll find the production rate of vanilla ice cream. The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the hourly production rate, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now that we have the production rates for both types of ice cream, we can calculate the total quarts produced in 48 hours. For chocolate ice cream, the total quarts produced would be 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts. For vanilla ice cream, the total quarts produced would be 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

To find the total quarts of ice cream produced in 48 hours, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream: 2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To determine Marcus' total bill, we must first calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

The cost of the croissants is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00. The cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00. The cost of the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. Lastly, the cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost before the discount is the sum of these individual costs: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Next, we calculate the discount, which is 10% of the total cost. This is equivalent to 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to obtain the final bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should purchase, we need to consider the deal offered by the ice cream parlor. The deal states that for every 2 scoops purchased, Erin receives 1 additional scoop for free. 

Given that each scoop costs $1.50, we can calculate the total cost of 2 scoops, which is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00. Since Erin has $6.00, she can afford to buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops for $3.00. 

With the remaining $3.00, Erin can buy 2 more scoops, but this would not be the most cost-effective option. Instead, she can buy 2 more scoops and get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops for $3.00. 

However, Erin can also use the remaining $3.00 to buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, and then use the remaining $1.50 to buy 1 more scoop, making it a total of 4 scoops. 

Considering the options, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the difference in the amount of candy Amy and Ginger have after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies each consumes in that time frame and then subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day, so over 14 days, she consumes 4 * 14 = 56 pieces. 

Amy, on the other hand, eats 3 pieces of candy per day, resulting in a total consumption of 3 * 14 = 42 pieces over the same period.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy have 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left, while Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

The difference in the amount of candy Amy and Ginger have after two weeks is 58 - 44 = 14 pieces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total number of mosaic tiles required, we first need to calculate the area that Mr. Boarden needs to cover, which is two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

We can calculate this by multiplying 36 by 2/3. To do this, we can multiply 36 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

36 * 2 = 72

Now, we divide 72 by 3 to find the area that needs to be covered.

72 / 3 = 24

So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 sq ft. 

Since he needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we can find the total number of tiles required by multiplying the area by the number of tiles per square foot.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The final answer is: 576"
"To determine the amount James saved by picking blueberries, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking blueberries is comprised of an initial fee of $20 and an additional $1.5 per pound. Given that James picked 30 pounds of blueberries, the total cost of picking is $20 + (1.5 * 30) = $20 + $45 = $65.

On the other hand, the cost of buying blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound. Therefore, the total cost of purchasing 30 pounds of blueberries at the store is 2.5 * 30 = $75.

The difference in cost between buying at the store and picking is $75 - $65 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid for the computers, we first need to determine the new price of each computer. The original price of each computer was $700, but it was 10% higher than planned.

To find the 10% increase, we multiply the original price by 0.1: 0.1 * 700 = 70. 

The new price of each computer is the original price plus the 10% increase: 700 + 70 = 770.

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers by multiplying the new price by the number of computers: 500 * 770 = 385,000.

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To determine the total calories in the omelet, we must first calculate the calories contributed by each component. 

Eggs are a primary component of the omelet, and since there are 6 eggs, we can calculate their total calories as follows: 6 eggs * 75 calories per egg = 450 calories.

The omelet also contains 2 oz of cheese, and given that cheese has a caloric density of 120 calories per ounce, we can calculate its total calories as: 2 oz * 120 calories per oz = 240 calories.

Lastly, the omelet contains an equal amount of ham, which is also 2 oz. With a caloric density of 40 calories per ounce, the total calories from the ham are: 2 oz * 40 calories per oz = 80 calories.

To find the total calories in the omelet, we sum the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The final answer is: 770"
"To determine the change received after purchasing 6 pencils and 8 erasers, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items.

The cost of a pencil is $0.50, and the cost of an eraser is $0.25. 

The total cost of the pencils is 6 * $0.50 = $3.
The total cost of the erasers is 8 * $0.25 = $2.

The total cost of the items is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since the total cost is $5 and the amount paid is $10, the change received is $10 - $5 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To find the number of people who accept the position, we need to calculate the percentage of applicants who progress through each stage of the hiring process.

First, we determine the number of people who receive interviews. Given that 30% of the applicants receive interviews, we can calculate this as follows:

30% of 100 people = 0.3 * 100 = 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we find the number of people who receive a job offer. Since 20% of those who receive interviews receive a job offer, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 30 people = 0.2 * 30 = 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, we need to find the number of people who accept the position. A third of those who receive a job offer accept the position, which can be calculated as follows:

A third of 6 people = 6 / 3 = 2 people accept the position.

"To determine the total amount of rice given to Goldy's cousin and brother, we first need to calculate the total number of sacks given away. This can be found by adding the number of sacks given to her cousin and brother.

The number of sacks given to her cousin is 3, and the number given to her brother is 4. Therefore, the total number of sacks given away is 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we can find the total weight of rice given away by multiplying the total number of sacks by the weight per sack.

Total weight of rice given away = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of cereal boxes Castle purchased between this week and last week, we need to calculate the total number of boxes she bought in each week and then find the difference between the two totals.

This week, Castle acquired 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. To find the total number of boxes she bought this week, we add the number of Coco Crunch boxes to the number of Fruit Loops boxes: 3 + 5 = 8.

Last week, she purchased 4 boxes of cereal.

To find the difference in the number of boxes between this week and last week, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week: 8 - 4 = 4.

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To determine the total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the total number of taps for two different scenarios: when her arms are down and when her arms are up.

When her arms are down, Helga taps her right foot at a rate of 300 times per minute and her left foot at a rate of 250 times per minute. Therefore, the total number of taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550. Since she dances for 3 minutes with her arms down, the total number of taps is 550 * 3 = 1650.

When her arms are up, Helga taps her right foot at a rate of 200 times per minute and her left foot at a rate of 200 times per minute. Thus, the total number of taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400. Since she dances for 2 minutes with her arms up, the total number of taps is 400 * 2 = 800.

To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we add the total number of taps for both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to consider the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the total damage it will cause to his car.

The damage to his car is estimated to be $450. The cost of fixing the pothole includes a fine for unauthorized road maintenance, which is $120, and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, each priced at $25. Therefore, the total cost of asphalt is 3 * $25 = $75.

The total cost of fixing the pothole is the sum of the fine and the cost of asphalt, which is $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, we can calculate the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole by subtracting the total cost of fixing the pothole from the total damage it will cause to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

"To determine the total number of chairs left in the restaurant, we need to calculate the difference between the initial number of chairs and the number of chairs sent for repair.

The restaurant initially had 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs, totaling 193 chairs. 

The number of chairs sent for repair consists of 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs, which amounts to 33 chairs.

To find the number of chairs left, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total initial number of chairs: 193 - 33 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two of his friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

Let's denote the total number of slices as S. Since there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends), and each person gets a pizza with 12 slices, the total number of slices is S = 5 * 12 = 60.

The number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends is 2/3 of the total number of slices, which is (2/3) * 60 = 40.

However, we know that 2 of these people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

40 slices - 24 slices = 16 slices

Now, we know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

Total number of slices = 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices
Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 16 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we first need to find the time taken by the dog. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = (2/3) * 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = 20 minutes

Now, we can find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog by taking the mean of their respective times.

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can calculate the length of Topher's shoe as follows:

8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches
Adding 4 inches to that gives us 96 + 4 = 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we can express the relationship between the length of Topher's shoe and Bobby's shoe as an equation. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be written as:

x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us:

x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) * (64 * 4) = (1/4) * 256 = 64

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows. Since Hannah smashes three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) * (32 * 2) = (3/4) * 64 = 48

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars:

Total windows smashed = 64 + 48 = 112

The final answer is: $\boxed{112}$"
"To determine the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to calculate the total number of blue spools and the total number of spools.

The total number of blue spools is the sum of the light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

The total number of spools is the sum of all the spools, including the light blue, dark blue, light green, and dark green spools.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue is 40%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, we find the number of people who voted by midday. 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

Next, we calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00. 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by 16:00. The number of people remaining after midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.
5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we must first calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will consume during this period. Given that he chews 4 pieces of gum per day, the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days is 4 * 30 = 120.

Next, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack, which is 15. This will give us the number of packs Parker will need: 120 / 15 = 8.

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we first need to calculate the total number of smores needed. 

9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.
The total number of smores required is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, the total number of sleeves needed is 24 / 8 = 3.
Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the total number of boxes needed is 3 / 3 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first determine their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. This can be expressed as 2x + 8, where x is Dora's age. Substituting x = 15, we get 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, her age can be expressed as (2x + 8) - 4. Substituting x = 15, we get (2(15) + 8) - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their individual ages: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, which is 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Since the total number of voters is 100, the combined votes for candidates A and B amount to 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Therefore, candidate C received the remaining votes, which is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the initial difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, who has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial amount of apples as follows:

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Next, we need to find out how many apples Beck has after Boris gives him 10 apples. We can do this by adding 10 to Beck's initial amount of apples:

Beck's final apples = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's final apples = 77 + 10
Beck's final apples = 87

Now, we need to find out how many apples Boris has after giving 10 apples to Beck. We can do this by subtracting 10 from Boris's initial amount of apples:

Boris's final apples = Boris's initial apples - 10
Boris's final apples = 100 - 10
Boris's final apples = 90

Finally, we need to find the difference between Boris's and Beck's final amounts of apples:

Difference = Boris's final apples - Beck's final apples
Difference = 90 - 87

"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we can start by determining the total number of students who like to play music. It is given that this number is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

Next, we can find the total number of students who like to either play video games or music. This is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students who like to bake and the number of students who like to play basketball. Therefore, the total number of students who like to play video games or music is 50 - (10 + 5) = 35.

Since we know that 10 students like to play music, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with a total of 80 students, we can divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of students in each class.

80 students / 2 classes = 40 students per class

Next, we are given that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the number of students in each class by 40% (or 0.4).

40 students * 0.4 = 16 girls per class

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 students - 16 girls = 24 boys per class

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationships between the number of marbles each person has. Let's denote the number of marbles Sean has as S, the number of marbles Carl has as C, and the number of marbles Cal has as Ca.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56. We are also given that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, which can be expressed as S = Ca/2. Substituting the value of S, we get 56 = Ca/2, and solving for Ca, we find Ca = 112.

Furthermore, we are given that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, which can be expressed as C = 4S. Substituting the value of S, we get C = 4(56) = 224.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: C + Ca = 224 + 112 = 336.

The final answer is: $\boxed{336}$"
"To determine the number of additional groups needed, we first need to find the total number of students required for 12 groups. Since each group will have an equal number of students, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups to find the number of students per group.

Given that there are 54 students, we divide this number by the initial 6 groups to confirm the number of students per group.

Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we know that each group will have 9 students. To find the total number of students required for 12 groups, we multiply the number of groups by the students per group.

Total students required = 12 * 9
Total students required = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups.

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

To find the number of additional groups required, we divide the additional students required by the students per group.

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total number of chairs rented by Candy in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the average number of chairs rented per week and then multiply it by the total number of weeks in two months.

First, let's find the average number of chairs rented per week. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. 

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekend days: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, we need to find the total number of weeks in two months. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, two months would have 8 weeks.

Now, multiply the total chairs rented in a week by the total number of weeks in two months:
500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To determine the number of bananas Gunther had at the end, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas, so the number of bananas left is 48 / 2 = 24.

Gunther then added 25 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 24 + 25 = 49.

However, Arnold stole 12 bananas from this new total, leaving 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

Finally, Gunther added 6 bananas, resulting in a total of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

The final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

"To determine the annual electricity cost per roommate, we first need to calculate the monthly cost per roommate. Given that the total monthly electricity bill is $100 and there are 4 roommates, we can find the monthly cost per roommate by dividing the total bill by the number of roommates.

$100 / 4 = $25 per roommate per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the annual cost per roommate by multiplying the monthly cost by 12.

$25 * 12 = $300 per roommate per year.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the current number of glasses and plates Jeff has, we need to calculate the total number of items sent and then subtract the number of broken items.

First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates sent. Since a dozen is equal to 12, we can multiply the number of dozens by 12 to find the total number of items.

- Glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- Plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items:
- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

Glasses left: 96 - 10 = 86
Plates left: 48 - 6 = 42

Therefore, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and apply the given conversion rates between stickers and buttons.

First, let's consider Lorraine's initial holdings: 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

When she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, she gets 0.9 * 30 = 27 small buttons. This leaves her with 3 small stickers.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, which yields 0.5 * 40 = 20 large buttons. This leaves her with 20 large stickers.

Now, she trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

To find the total number of buttons Lorraine has, we sum the buttons she obtained from trading small stickers (27 small buttons), the buttons she obtained from trading large stickers (20 large buttons), and the buttons she obtained from trading the remaining large stickers (60 small buttons). 

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is 27 + 20 + 60 = 107.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday. 
He played 1 match on Friday. 
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches played on each day: 
2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we need to calculate the number of students for each size and add them together.

First, we establish the number of students for each size. Let's start with the extra-small shirts, which 11 students need.

Next, we know that twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students who need size small is 2 * 11 = 22.

Moving on, we find that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. This means the number of students who need size medium is 22 - 4 = 18.

We also know that half as many students need size large as size medium. So, the number of students who need size large is 18 / 2 = 9.

Lastly, six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students who need size extra-large is 9 + 6 = 15.

Now, let's add the number of students for each size together to find the total number of shirts ordered:
11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

Discount = $140 * 0.05
Discount = $7

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price.

Final price = Original price - Discount
Final price = $140 - $7
Final price = $133

The final answer is: $133"
"To determine the total duration of the 20 playlists, we need to consider the number of songs in each playlist, the number of playlists, and the length of each song.

Given that each playlist contains 300 songs and each song is 10 hours long, we can calculate the total duration by first finding the total number of songs across all playlists. This is done by multiplying the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists.

Number of songs in each playlist: 300
Number of playlists: 20

Total number of songs = 300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs

Next, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song in hours to find the total duration.

Total duration = 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"To determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win the big race, we first need to calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win and then the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of the total 50 people think horse #2 will win. This can be calculated as 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 people.

Next, we calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win, which is 60% of the remaining 40 people. This can be calculated as 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people: 40 - 24 = 16 people.

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16.

"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we can start by determining the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and we know there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as P. We can set up the equation:

2/3 * P = 18

Multiplying both sides by 3/2 gives us:

P = 18 * (3/2)
P = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"To determine the amount Jayden needs to buy the camera, we must first calculate the total amount of money he has after receiving his sister's allowance. Initially, Jayden had $70. His sister, Ava, gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. Therefore, Jayden now has a total of $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x.

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we first need to calculate the total time available and the time spent playing soccer.

The total time available is the sum of the hours on Saturday and Sunday, which is 7 hours and 5 hours, respectively. Therefore, the total time available is 12 hours.

Tatiana spends 3 hours reading, leaving 9 hours of time remaining. Since she spends 1/3 of this remaining time playing video games, we can calculate this as 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer by subtracting the time spent reading and playing video games from the total time available: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we can use the formula: (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100. Substituting the values, we get (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer is 50%.

"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, Anthony gives 1/2 of his 50 pencils to Brandon. This can be calculated as 50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon. Consequently, Anthony is left with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

Next, Anthony gives 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find 3/5 of 25, we multiply 25 by 3/5, which is equivalent to 25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie. Therefore, Anthony is left with 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.

Thus, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total time Jack is away from home, we need to consider both the time spent driving to and from the museum, as well as the time he spends at the museum itself.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 miles per hour. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we can calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum as follows:

Time = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since the distance to the museum is the same as the distance back home, the time it takes to drive back home is also 2 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time Jack spends driving by adding the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time it takes to drive back home:

Total driving time = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Finally, we need to add the time Jack spends at the museum to the total driving time to determine the total time he is away from home:

"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break down the cost into three categories: movies in series, older movies, and normal movies.

First, let's calculate the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can find this by dividing the total number of movies by 3:

600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Given that these movies can be purchased at a discounted rate of $6 each, the total cost for the movies in series is:

200 * $6 = $1200

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 = 400 movies

Now, we calculate the number of older movies, which is 40% of the remaining movies:

400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of these older movies is:

160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:

400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is:

240 * $10 = $2400

To find the total cost, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies:

$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final numerical answer is: $4400"

"To determine the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then sum these values.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. Given that their driving speed was 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is 25 miles per hour. Since they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour. Using the formula distance = speed * time, we find that the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, we'll determine the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Using the same formula, the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

To find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked. Therefore, the total distance is 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

"To determine the difference in the scores of Ava and Emma, we need to consider the points they receive for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and completing the level within a certain time frame.

Let's denote Emma's score as x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, her enemy score is x + 8. Additionally, Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so her berry score is x + 3. 

Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, her timer score is 30(60 - (x + 4)) = 30(56 - x) = 1680 - 30x.

Emma's total score is x, as she doesn't jump on any extra enemies or collect any extra berries and completes the level in the same time as the timer is 60 seconds.

Ava's total score is (x + 8) + (x + 3) + (1680 - 30x) = 2x + 1691 - 30x = -28x + 1691.

However, we can simplify this problem by considering the differences in their scores. The difference in their enemy scores is 8, the difference in their berry scores is 3, and the difference in their timer scores is 30(60 - (x + 4)) - 30(60) = 30(-4) = -120.

The difference in their scores is 8 + 3 - 120 = -109.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-109}$"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. This can be calculated as 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying W white fish and O orange fish, he had 3 + O orange fish and 4 + W white fish. Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so W + O = 17.

We can solve the first equation for O: O = 2(4 + W) - 3 = 8 + 2W - 3 = 5 + 2W.

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the second equation: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combine like terms: 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week. Given that the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, and he makes this trip twice a day (to and from work), the daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy commutes to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency, which is 10 miles per gallon (MPG). Therefore, the fuel consumption per week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can calculate the total weekly cost by multiplying the fuel consumption per week by the price of gas, which is $3 per gallon. Thus, the weekly cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

First, we calculate the value of the quarters: 140 quarters * $0.25 = $35.

Next, we calculate the value of the twenties she spent. Since she spent 3/5 of the twenties, we multiply the total value of the twenties by 3/5. The total value of the twenties is 10 * $20 = $200. Therefore, the amount she spent from the twenties is 3/5 * $200 = $120.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties to find the total amount of money she spent: $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can obtain from his garden, we need to calculate the yield of each type of plant and then sum the results.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes: 5 tomato plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants: 8 eggplant plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants.

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the overall yield: 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the amount of money John is missing, we first need to calculate the portion of the trip cost that the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Half of the trip cost = $300 / 2 = $150

This means the school will cover $150, and John has $50. To find out how much John is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the amount the school will cover:

Amount John is missing = Amount school will cover - Amount John has
= $150 - $50
= $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we must first calculate the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point.

The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. Given that it's 33 degrees colder during the night, the nighttime temperature is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

The temperature difference between the freezing point (32 degrees) and the nighttime temperature (12 degrees) is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can calculate the number of logs needed by dividing the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of seashells brought back by the groups, we first need to calculate the number of groups formed and then the number of groups that brought back seashells.

The total number of people is 90, and they are divided into groups of 9 people each. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group.

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we need to find the number of groups that brought back seashells. It is given that 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells. To find this, we multiply the total number of groups by the fraction of groups that brought back seashells.

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we can find the total number of seashells brought back by these groups. Each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells.

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of people on the train after the two stops, we need to consider the changes in the number of passengers at each stop.

Initially, there are 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off, resulting in a decrease of 47 passengers. This leaves us with 172 - 47 = 125 people on the train.

Next, 13 people get on the train at the first stop, increasing the total number of passengers to 125 + 13 = 138.

Finally, at the next stop, 38 people get off, reducing the number of passengers to 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, the number of people on the train after the two stops is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

First, we need to find out how much money Damien makes per day. Since he finds 10 bottle caps a day and each bottle cap is worth $0.25, we can multiply the number of bottle caps by the value of each cap.

Daily earnings = Number of bottle caps per day * Value of each bottle cap
= 10 * $0.25
= $2.50 per day

Now, we can find the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days in the month.

Total earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days in the month
= $2.50 * 30
= $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. This is equivalent to 1.5 times her regular hourly rate, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. For 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions and add it to the number of female lions and lion cubs.

The number of female lions is given as 12. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can find the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2. This results in 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.

We are also given that there are 14 lion cubs.

To find the total number of lions, we can add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs: 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To determine the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at a 25% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal).

Discount = 0.25 * $40
Discount = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the price after the discount.

Price after discount = Original price - Discount
Price after discount = $40 - $10
Price after discount = $30

To find the amount of money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill, we subtract the price after the discount from the $50 bill.

Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be the sum of the initial employees and the employees hired in each subsequent month:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"To determine the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total duration of the songs they plan to sing. The choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and ""Jingle Bells"" once.

The duration of ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds, and since it is sung twice, the total time for this song is 2 * 150 = 300 seconds. The duration of ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds.

To find the total caroling time, we add the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" and the time for ""Jingle Bells"": 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

"To determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. After 2 months, he receives a raise of $0.50 per hour, resulting in a new hourly wage of $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Following another year, he receives a raise of $1.00 per hour, increasing his hourly wage to $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by both the students and the teachers.

First, let's calculate the total number of students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class, so the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000.

Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is also 1000.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class, so the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120.

Each teacher plants two trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

To find the total number of trees planted, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers: 1000 + 240 = 1240.

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to determine the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then calculate the number of goats required to make up 30% of the total.

The total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has is the sum of the number of puppies, koalas, zebras, and frogs: 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14.

To find the number of stuffed goats needed to make up 30% of the total, we can set up the equation: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

However, this equation is not correct. We need to set up the equation as follows: 

(14 + x) / (14 + x) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can cross multiply: 

100(14 + x) = 30(14 + x)

Expanding the equation: 

1400 + 100x = 420 + 30x

Subtracting 30x from both sides: 

1400 + 70x = 420

Subtracting 1400 from both sides: 

70x = -980

Dividing both sides by 70: 

x = -14

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3: 

14 + x = 100

However, this is not the correct equation. We need to set up the equation as follows: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3: 

14 + x = 100

However, this is not the correct equation. We need to set up the equation as follows: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3: 

14 + x = 100

However, this is not the correct equation. We need to set up the equation as follows:

"To determine the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we must first calculate the total hours she has played. 

In two weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays a total of 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in two weeks.

In one week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays a total of 7 * 2 = 14 hours in one week.

The total hours Kris has played is the sum of the hours played in two weeks and one week, which is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find the number of hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour. Using the formula distance = speed * time, we can calculate the distance it travels in 2 hours as follows:
distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at a speed of 70 miles per hour. Using the same formula, we can calculate the distance it travels in 2 hours as follows:
distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars will be the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours is 20 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the ring, we need to consider the cost of the diamond and the gold, as well as the premium for the craftsmanship. The diamond costs $600, and the gold costs $300. 

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900. 

The premium for the craftsmanship is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. To calculate this, we multiply the total cost by 0.3: 0.3 * $900 = $270.

Therefore, the total cost of the ring, including the premium, is $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To determine the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade. We know that 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, and 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed. The pass rate for the 400 fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders. Since the fourth-graders had a pass rate of 40/100, the fifth-graders had a pass rate of 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. Therefore, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, we need to find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we first need to calculate the total number of square inches Milo can create with the available glass chips. Since each square inch requires 12 chips, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips as follows:

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips per bag
Total chips = 144 chips

Next, we can find the total number of square inches Milo can create with the available chips:

Total square inches = Total chips / chips per square inch
Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch
Total square inches = 12 square inches

Given that the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can now calculate the length of the mosaic by dividing the total area by the height:

Length = Total square inches / height
Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches
Length = 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long."
"To determine the initial amount of tea at the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea consumed to gallons by dividing by 4. However, we are interested in the initial amount of tea, which is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left. 

The amount of tea left is given as 10 quarts. Therefore, the initial amount of tea is 38 (tea consumed) + 10 (tea left) = 48 quarts.

To convert this to gallons, we divide by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Dale initially ordered 100 candies. However, he sold 150 candies, which means he had to order more to replace them. After selling 150 candies, he ordered an additional 100 candies. Therefore, the total number of candies he has is 100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200.

Since he sold 150 candies, we can find the number of candies he still needs to sell by subtracting the number of candies sold from the total number of candies: 200 - 150 = 50.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we need to calculate the number of times the initial number of students doubles from January to May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

The number of students at the end of May is 160. To find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we can start by calculating the total number of branches he climbed during the week. Given that he made $105 and charges $0.25 per branch, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total money made by the cost per branch.

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked for 5 days, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by the number of days.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so the total number of marshmallows used is 18. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows, bringing the total number of marshmallows used and dropped to 21.

Now, we can find the number of marshmallows left in the bag by subtracting the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows. 

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since there are two kids, we can divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to determine the number of S'mores each kid can have.

Marshmallows left = 14
Number of kids = 2
S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total amount of money used at the arcade, we need to calculate the total time played by each individual and then multiply it by the cost per minute.

Let's denote the time Jack plays as J, the time the two friends who are worse than him play as W, and the time the friend who is better than Jack plays as B. We are given that J = 4 hours, which is equivalent to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 

The two friends who are worse than Jack play for half the time, so W = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes. The friend who is better than Jack plays for 1.5 times the time, so B = 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played is the sum of the time played by each individual, which is J + W + W + B = 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

The total amount of money used is the product of the total time played and the cost per minute, which is 840 * 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the amount of oil Tanya uses in her salt scrub, we can establish a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x, the amount of salt (and sugar) as 2x, and the amount of oil as 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, which is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 8x = 10. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8, yielding x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, we can substitute the value of x to find the amount of oil: 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses in her salt scrub is 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount of money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats can be calculated by multiplying the number of goats by the cost per goat: 3 goats * $500 = $1500.

Similarly, the cost of the cows can be calculated by multiplying the number of cows by the cost per cow: 2 cows * $1500 = $3000.

To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine the number of additional cupcakes Paul should purchase, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of cupcakes required and the number of cupcakes he already possesses.

The total number of cupcakes Paul needs is 63. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which amounts to a total of 48 cupcakes.

To find the number of additional cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes required:

63 (total cupcakes needed) - 48 (cupcakes already have) = 15

Therefore, Paul should purchase 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the initial number of cars Joe has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, we can calculate Joe's initial number of cars as 2 * 20 = 40.

Next, we need to find out how many cars Joe sells. He sells 20% of his cars, which is equivalent to 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Furthermore, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Therefore, Joe gives away a total of 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we first need to calculate the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity received a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students collectively raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we can find the amount each student raised by dividing the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20).

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on each day and then sum the results.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, 8 hours is equivalent to 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

On the second day, Sandy walked for half the time she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours. Converting this to minutes, we have 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is the sum of the time she walked on each day, which is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to determine the number of cars present in the parking lot at that time. Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, resulting in a total of 70 cars.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he observed that half of the cars had left. This means that 1/2 of 70 had departed, leaving 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars in the parking lot.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we first need to calculate his daily earnings. Given that he completes 30 cycles of work per day, each cycle consisting of 5 tasks, and each task paying $1.20, we can calculate his daily earnings as follows:

Daily earnings = Number of cycles per day * Number of tasks per cycle * Pay per task
Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Now, to find his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a week, which is 7.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7
Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To determine the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate her points in each game and then sum them.

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. 

Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. Therefore, Julie's score in the first game is 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add Sasha's points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food purchased by Kimberly, we first need to calculate the total number of tins of each type. 

The number of tins of cat food can be found by multiplying the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Similarly, the number of tins of dog food can be found by multiplying the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then sum them together.

First, let's establish the number of green eggs, which is given as 5. 

Next, we know that the number of blue eggs is twice the number of green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is 2 * 5 = 10.

The number of pink eggs is one fewer than the number of blue eggs, so it is 10 - 1 = 9.

Lastly, the number of yellow eggs is one-third the number of pink eggs, which is 9 / 3 = 3.

Now, we can calculate the total number of eggs by adding the number of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles. Therefore, the total cost of shipping is calculated as follows:

Cost of shipping = (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20)
= 1.4 + 1.6
= $2.99

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32. The refund amount is:

Refund amount = 0.75 * 32
= $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:

Total loss = Cost of shipping + (Purchase price - Refund amount)
= 2.99 + (32 - 24)
= 2.99 + 8
= $10.99

The final answer is: $10.99"
"To determine the amount of money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the total amount of money she had initially.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Mulan had after her father gave her $100. This is $40 (initial amount) + $100 (gift from her father) = $140.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money she spent on the items she purchased. She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 * $30 = $60. Additionally, she bought a bag for $20. Therefore, the total amount of money she spent is $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount of money she spent from the total amount of money she had initially: $140 - $80 = $60.

"To determine the amount of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate. The second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on various activities per week and then multiply it by 4 to account for the four weeks in a month.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on writing songs per week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2 hours is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the time Britany spends on makeup per week. She does her makeup for 15 minutes, six days a week, so the total time spent on makeup per week is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time Britany spends on recording videos per week. She records 18 videos, each lasting 4 minutes, so the total time spent on recording videos per week is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.

To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok per week, we need to sum the time spent on writing songs, makeup, and recording videos. This gives us 120 + 90 + 72 = 282 minutes.

Converting the total weekly time to hours, we get 282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours.

Finally, to find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18.8}$"
"To determine the total cost of the installation, we need to break down the costs into two categories: the initial installation and the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, which costs $129.00. Angela has additional items that need to be installed: 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.

First, we need to calculate the number of additional items that need to be installed. For mirrors, Angela has 6, but the initial installation already includes 4, so we need to install 2 additional mirrors. For chandeliers, Angela has 2, but the initial installation already includes 1, so we need to install 1 additional chandelier. For pictures, Angela has 20, but the initial installation already includes 10, so we need to install 10 additional pictures.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the additional items. Each additional item costs $15.00, so we multiply the number of additional items by the cost per item:

- Additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

To find the total cost, we add the initial installation cost to the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To determine the amount of money Roy has saved, we can start by establishing the amount saved by his sister, Eva, which is $20.00. Given that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate his savings as $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we are told that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we can multiply $30.00 by 0.4, which yields $12.00. To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add this 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"To determine the height at which Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to establish a hierarchical relationship between the individuals' lifting capabilities. 

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay's lifting capacity is 12 times that of Pompei, which is 12 inches. 

Kagiyami's lifting capacity is 4 times that of Saskay, which is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto's lifting capacity is 10 times that of Kagiyami, which is 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Mason, we can calculate the distance covered in each segment of his journey and then sum the results.

Given that Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour, we can use the formula Distance = Speed x Time to find the distance covered in each segment.

For the first 4 hours, the distance covered is 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles.

For the next 6 hours, the distance covered is 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles.

The total distance traveled by Mason is the sum of the distances covered in each segment, which is 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, we first need to establish the time it takes for one kangaroo to make the journey. Given that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take a total of 18 hours to cross the highway, we can infer that the time for one kangaroo is 18 hours multiplied by 3, which equals 54 hours.

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it logically follows that they will require twice as much time to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is 54 hours multiplied by 2, resulting in 108 hours.

The final answer is: 108"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can start by identifying the number of dishes each person made. 

Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, we can calculate Rory's total as 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. 

Jada, on the other hand, made twice as many dishes as Rory. Therefore, Jada's total is 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of dishes made by all three, we add the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's help.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 and her mom gave her $80, so the total amount of money she received is: 
$150 + $80 = $230

Since Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs: 
$400 + $50 = $450

Now, we can find the initial amount of money Erika had in her purse by subtracting the amount she received from the total amount she has: 
$450 - $230 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the number of apple slices left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam has. 

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam has 3 large apples. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is 3 x 5 = 15.

Similarly, a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam has 5 small apples. Thus, the total number of slices from the small apples is 5 x 3 = 15.

The total number of slices Adam has is the sum of the slices from the large and small apples, which is 15 + 15 = 30.

After eating 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total milk production required per day. Given that the farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can proceed with the calculation.

The milk production rate per cow is 5 liters per day. To find the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can divide the total milk production required by the milk production rate per cow.

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find the difference between the required number of cows and the number of cows he already has.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

First, we'll find the unused portion of the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left. To do this, we multiply 12 millimeters by 1/6.

12 * (1/6) = 12/6 = 2 millimeters

Next, we'll find the unused portion of the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left. To do this, we multiply 12 millimeters by 2/3.

12 * (2/3) = 24/3 = 8 millimeters

Lastly, we'll find the unused portion of the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left. To do this, we multiply 12 millimeters by 1/2.

12 * (1/2) = 12/2 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions together: 
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount of money Gabriel still needs, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to acquire. The car costs $10,000 and the phone costs $800, so the total cost is $10,000 + $800 = $10,800.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently possesses. He has $5,000 from his weekend work and an additional $200 from his brother, resulting in a total of $5,000 + $200 = $5,200.

To find the amount of money Gabriel still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost of the items: $10,800 - $5,200 = $4,600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $4,600."
"To determine the change Thea received, we need to calculate the difference between the amount she gave the craftsman and the cost of the hat. 

The amount she gave the craftsman is $80, as she provided four $20 bills. 

Now, let's calculate the change: $80 - $70 = $10

Thea received $10 as change."
"To determine the amount of money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Craig begins with 2 twenty-dollar bills, which equates to 2 * $20 = $40.

He purchases 6 squirt guns at $2 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 6 * $2 = $12.

Additionally, he buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, leading to a total expenditure of 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount spent is the sum of the expenditures on squirt guns and water balloons, which is $12 + $9 = $21.

To find the remaining amount, we subtract the total expenditure from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of socks and dishes collected by Jack and Peter.

Let's denote the number of socks Jack collected as S and the number of dishes Jack collected as D. We are given that Jack collected 60 dishes, so D = 60.

We are also given that Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, which can be expressed as D = 2S. Substituting D = 60, we get 60 = 2S, and solving for S, we find S = 30.

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter's socks = 2S = 2 * 30 = 60.

We are also given that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter's dishes = D/2 = 60/2 = 30.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the number of socks and dishes collected by both Jack and Peter: Total = S + D + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes = 30 + 60 + 60 + 30 = 180.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the number of students good at math, we can use a Venn diagram or the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of students good at math as M, the number of students good at English as E, and the number of students good at both as B.

Given that T = 20, M - B = 5 (students good at math only), and E - B = 8 (students good at English only), we can find the number of students good at both subjects by subtracting the sum of students good at math only and English only from the total number of students.

B = T - (M - B + E - B)
B = 20 - (5 + 8)
B = 20 - 13
B = 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the students good at math only and those good at both subjects.

M = (M - B) + B
M = 5 + 7
M = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

Each group requires 10 minutes for setup, performance, and exit. The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. However, there is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes to perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to consider the simple interest formula: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal (initial investment), r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, we can express it as a decimal: r = 0.75. The principal amount P is $300, and the time period t is 3 years.

However, since the interest rate is not a standard percentage, we need to adjust the formula to account for the fact that the interest rate is a fraction of the principal. The interest earned each year is 0.75 * $300 = $225.

The total amount after 1 year is $300 + $225 = $525. 
The total amount after 2 years is $525 + $225 = $750.
The total amount after 3 years is $750 + $225 = $975.

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975.

The final answer is: $975"
"To determine the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we first need to find the total number of floral shirts with buttons. Given that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 20. Consequently, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

To find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars, we subtract the latter from the former: 30 - 20 = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the farmer's earnings, we first need to calculate the number of trays he can fill with the given number of eggs. This can be done by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30

Now, we can find the farmer's earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray.

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the number of goats left in the two farms, we first need to calculate the number of goats sold from each farm. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X. Since he sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, we can find the number of goats sold from Farm Y by multiplying the number of goats sold from Farm X by 2.

Number of goats sold from Farm Y = 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we can find the number of goats left in each farm by subtracting the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm.

Number of goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45
Number of goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y.

Total number of goats left = 45 + 25 = 70

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to calculate the total expenditure on shoes per year and divide it by the number of pairs purchased annually.

Given that James spends $2640 on shoes each year and buys 2 pairs of shoes per month, we can calculate the total number of pairs purchased per year as follows:

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we can find the average cost per pair by dividing the total expenditure by the number of pairs:

$2640 / 24 pairs = $110/pair

Therefore, James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To determine the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, we must first calculate the individual costs and then apply the discount for the red food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75. 
The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

The total cost before the discount is the sum of the costs of the green and red food baskets, which is $75 + $54 = $129.

However, we also need to account for the discount on the red food. Since we are purchasing 3 baskets of red food and each basket receives a $2 discount, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

To find the total cost after the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount: $129 - $6 = $123.

Therefore, the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, with the discount applied, is $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To determine the time required to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of this number is 45 rooms.

Now, we can calculate the total time it takes to clean these rooms. Given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert this time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour.

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote my age as 'x', my brother's age as 'x + 3', my sister's age as 'x - 2', and my mom's age as '3(x + 3) - 1'.

We know that the sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

However, since age cannot be a decimal, we need to re-examine the equation. Let's try to find a whole number solution.

We can rewrite the equation as: 8x = 70.

Since 8x is a multiple of 8, we can try to find a whole number solution by dividing 70 by 8. However, 70 is not a multiple of 8, so we need to find the closest multiple of 8 that is less than or equal to 70.

The closest multiple of 8 that is less than or equal to 70 is 64. However, 64 is not equal to 70, so we need to find the next multiple of 8.

The next multiple of 8 is 72, but that is greater than 70. Therefore, we can try to find a whole number solution by using the equation 8x = 64.

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for his students. Given that there are 27 students in his class and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find the minimum number of packs needed. This gives us 54 / 8 = 6.75.

However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to purchase 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure that every student has 2 glue sticks and that there are some extra glue sticks left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river at a specific point, we need to consider the changes in water volume over three consecutive days.

On the first day, the initial volume of water is 4000 gallons. 

On the second day, the volume doubles due to heavy rain, resulting in a volume of 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume increases by an additional 6000 gallons, leading to a final volume of 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we sum the volumes of water for each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24000}$"
"To determine the total number of people infected after three days, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The initial number of infected people is 10, and each infected person infects 6 others every day.

Day 1: 
The 10 people initially infected will infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people, resulting in a total of 70 people infected.

Day 2: 
The 60 people infected on Day 1 will infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people, and the 10 people initially infected will infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people. This results in a total of 70 (previous) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 490 people infected.

Day 3: 
The 360 people infected on Day 2 will infect 360 * 6 = 2160 new people, the 60 people infected on Day 1 will infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people, and the 10 people initially infected will infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people. This results in a total of 490 (previous) + 2160 (new) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 3070 people infected.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3070}$"
"To determine the total amount of money received by Julieta and Rafaela as tips, we first need to calculate the amount received by each of them. 

Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, each giving her $20. Therefore, her total tips amount to 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find the amount received by Julieta, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips. 

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80.

Julieta's total tips are $800 - $80 = $720.

The total amount of money they received as tips is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. 
She gave her only son 3 oranges. 
So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Since Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges, we can find the number of oranges she remained with by subtracting the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges: 
12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a 1-year time frame, we need to establish the rate at which each individual earns badges.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. Given that Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, Amber's rate is 1/2 badge per month. Wendy, on the other hand, earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, resulting in a rate of 3 badges per month.

Over a 12-month period, the total number of badges earned by each individual can be calculated as follows:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount raised by Paige, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold, and then multiply that by the price per slice.

First, we calculate the total number of slices baked. Since Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour and she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours, we can find the total number of loaves baked by multiplying the number of loaves per hour by the number of hours:

2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:

10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

Next, we need to convert the price per slice from cents to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can divide the price per slice by 100:

50 cents/slice / 100 = $0.50/slice

Now, we can find the total amount raised by multiplying the total number of slices by the price per slice:

80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins she possesses. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We are given that G = S + 30 and G = 70.

Since G = S + 30 and G = 70, we can set up the equation S + 30 = 70. To isolate S, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

S + 30 - 30 = 70 - 30
S = 40

Now that we know S = 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = S + G
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we first need to calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George.

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Additionally, Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

The total number of burritos consumed is the sum of the burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George, which is 500 + 20 = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos in total, the number of leftover burritos can be calculated as follows:

Total burritos - Total burritos consumed = Leftover burritos
600 - 520 = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, we need to first establish the number of green and blue cars.

Given that the rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Next, we know that the rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has a total of 75 cars, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the overall total: 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given two pieces of information: Sofie has 25 more books than Anne (S = A + 25), and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn (A = F - 12).

We can express Sofie's books in terms of Fawn's books by substituting the second equation into the first: S = (F - 12) + 25, which simplifies to S = F + 13.

We also know that the total number of books is 85, so we can write the equation S + A + F = 85.

Substituting S = F + 13 into this equation, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85. Combining like terms, we have 2F + A + 13 = 85.

Now, we can substitute A = F - 12 into this equation: 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85. Simplifying, we get 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we have 3F = 84. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that F = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we first need to calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots, which is 3 pounds less than the weight of the sweet potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To determine the total amount Greg will spend on Jello, we first need to calculate the total number of Jello cups required for the party. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, the total number of Jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of Jello Greg needs to purchase. Since one box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, the number of boxes needed is 120 / 10 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the Jello. The cost of one box of Jello is $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

"To determine the change the seller will receive, we first need to calculate the total cost of the phones. Since the seller purchased 5 phones at $700 each, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of phones by the price of each phone.

Total cost = Number of phones * Price per phone
Total cost = 5 * $700
Total cost = $3500

Now, we need to find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount given to the seller. The seller was given $4000 in dollar bills.

Change = Amount given - Total cost
Change = $4000 - $3500
Change = $500

Therefore, the seller will receive $500 in change."
"To determine the amount Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate his share of the monthly grocery expenses. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

The total monthly expenses are $400. To find 40% of this amount, we multiply $400 by 0.4.

$400 * 0.4 = $160

This is the amount Keenan spends in a month. To find out how much he spends per week, we divide this amount by the number of weeks in a month, which is 4.

$160 / 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries."
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he consumed on each day and sum them up.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate this as follows:
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's calculate the number of pieces he ate on the third day. To do this, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

Next, we'll find 7/13 of the remaining pieces:
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

"To determine the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to establish the cost of a single unit of each item. 

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

Similarly, the cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To determine the cost price of the chickens Isaias bought, we first need to find out how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens on his farm, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Now, we know that he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue from selling these chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price per chicken:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are given that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000. This means the total revenue from selling the chickens should be the cost price plus the profit. Since we know the total revenue is $9000 and the profit is $2000, we can find the cost price as follows:

Cost price = Total revenue - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

Therefore, the cost price of the chickens Isaias bought is $7000.

"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, the cost of each pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of each packet of chicken is 2 * $2 = $4. The total cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, we find the cost of the strawberries and apples. The 3 packs of strawberries cost 3 * $4 = $12, and the 7 packs of apples cost 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

"To determine the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the runtime of her usual concert as x minutes. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x minutes. Additionally, the encore is 15 minutes long. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, so we can write the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation yields 2x = 65 - 15, which simplifies to 2x = 50. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us x = 50 / 2, and further simplification results in x = 25.

Therefore, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, whatchamacallit, and thingamabob. Given that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second, we can express the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is 55 meters per second.

"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we first need to calculate his new hourly wage after the pay increase. His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2. Therefore, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we can find Mark's weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 
Similarly, since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. 

We are given that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. Therefore, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6 + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y. 
54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine Harry's weight, we need to establish the weight of each individual in the given sequence.

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To determine John's profit from renting his car, we first need to calculate his total earnings from the rentals. This can be done by multiplying the number of times he rents his car by the number of hours per rental and his hourly rate.

Number of times rented: 10
Number of hours per rental: 3
Hourly rate: $25

Total earnings = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Next, we need to subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the initial number of notebooks Martha had. Since she bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7, we can find her initial number of notebooks by subtracting the additional notebooks from the total.

Martha's initial number of notebooks = Total number of notebooks - Additional notebooks
= 7 - 5
= 2

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find the number of notebooks Joseph had. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we can multiply Martha's initial number of notebooks by 3.

Joseph's number of notebooks = 3 * Martha's initial number of notebooks
= 3 * 2
= 6

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's number of notebooks from Martha's number of notebooks.

Difference in notebooks = Martha's number of notebooks - Joseph's number of notebooks
= 7 - 6
= 1

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we first need to calculate the distance rowed by Anis. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can express this as a mathematical expression.

Let's denote the distance rowed by Dijana as D. Then, the distance rowed by Anis is D + (1/5)D, which simplifies to (6/5)D.

Given that Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can substitute this value into the expression for Anis's distance: (6/5) * 50 = 60 miles.

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances: 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the number of cookies each of Susan's nephews will receive, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies remaining after her husband took some for himself. Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, the remaining number of cookies is 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, we can find the number of cookies each nephew will receive by dividing the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. This can be expressed as a division problem: 96 ÷ 6.

To solve this, we can use long division or a calculator. Using long division, we divide 96 by 6, which gives us a quotient of 16.

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will receive 16 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we need to calculate their total pages read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 5 + 13 = 18 pages. 
Daniel did not read any pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is the sum of her pages read yesterday and today, which is 10 + 18 = 28 pages.
Daniel's total pages read is the sum of his pages read yesterday, which is 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to consider the capacity of the pot and the number of people eating dinner.

The pot can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since there are 4 adults (Calvin, his wife, and two children) eating dinner, and each person eats one bowl, 4 adult bowls will be used. 

Since 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls, a total of 4 child bowls will also be used. This leaves 4 child bowls remaining.

There are 2 children, and each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup, we divide the remaining child bowls by the number of children: 4 / 2 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen, then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is calculated as a simple multiplication problem: 5 x $1.50 = $7.50. This is because when you multiply a number by a constant, you are essentially adding that constant a number of times equal to the first number. In this case, 5 x $1.50 is the same as $1.50 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $1.50.

The cost of 1 ballpen at $0.5 is simply $0.5.

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together: $7.50 + $0.5 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs to make face masks for her class, we must first calculate the material required for small and large masks separately.

For small masks, the material needed per mask is 2 yards divided by 4 masks, which equals 0.5 yards per mask. Therefore, the material required for 20 small masks is 20 * 0.5 yards = 10 yards.

For large masks, the material needed per mask is 2.25 yards divided by 3 masks, which equals 0.75 yards per mask. Consequently, the material required for 8 large masks is 8 * 0.75 yards = 6 yards.

To find the total material needed, we add the material required for small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to calculate the total amount she spent on tickets and then divide that by the total number of tickets she purchased.

Deepa saw each of the 9 movies three times, resulting in a total of 9 * 3 = 27 tickets.

The total amount she spent on these tickets is $216. 

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine Harold's free time, we must first calculate the total hours he dedicates to his daily activities. 

There are 24 hours in a standard day. Harold sleeps for 10 hours, which leaves 24 - 10 = 14 hours for other activities. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours. Additionally, he spends 1 hour walking his dog.

Total hours spent on activities = 8 (work) + 1 (walk) = 9 hours

Now, we can calculate Harold's free time by subtracting the total hours spent from the total hours in a day.

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total hours spent
Free time = 24 - 9
Free time = 15 hours

However, this is incorrect. We must consider that Harold sleeps for 10 hours, which is a part of his daily activities. Therefore, we should subtract the total hours spent from the remaining hours after sleep.

Remaining hours after sleep = 24 - 10 = 14 hours
Free time = Remaining hours after sleep - Total hours spent
Free time = 14 - 9
Free time = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of red and blue shoeboxes left in Tim's box, we first need to calculate the number of red shoeboxes he used for fishing. Since he used 1/3 of his red shoeboxes, we can find this by dividing the total number of red shoeboxes by 3.

Number of red shoeboxes used = 9 / 3 = 3

Now, we know that Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes for fishing. Initially, he had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. 

To find the number of blue shoeboxes left, we subtract the number used from the initial number: 7 - 3 = 4

To find the number of red shoeboxes left, we subtract the number used from the initial number: 9 - 3 = 6

Therefore, the total number of shoeboxes left is 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the current number of books Joseph has, we first need to establish the initial number of books he possessed. Since Joseph had twice the number of books as Sarah, and Sarah has 9 books, we can calculate Joseph's initial book count by multiplying Sarah's book count by 2.

Joseph's initial book count = 9 * 2 = 18

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we must subtract this number from his initial count to find the current number of books he has.

Current number of books Joseph has = 18 - 2 = 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate the total number of marbles he gave away. 

First, we find 1/5 of 30, which is 30 / 5 = 6. This is the number of marbles Dean gave to Jamie.

Additionally, Dean gave 10 marbles to Donald.

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find the number of marbles Dean has left, we subtract the total marbles given away from the initial amount: 30 - 16 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can express his age eight years ago as 60 - 8 = 52. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

52 = 2x

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

Now that we know Adam's age four years ago, we can find his current age by adding 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4
= 26 + 4
= 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
= 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To determine the total acres of both farms, we first need to calculate the acres of Farmer Smith's farm. This can be done by finding twice the acres of Farmer Brown's farm and then adding 100 to that result.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. Adding 100 to this value yields 400 + 100 = 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, we can find the total acres of both farms by adding the acres of each farm together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To determine Colby's earnings in a typical eight-hour workday, we first need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time. Given that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can express this as an equation: 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of packages completed in an 8-hour workday by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours worked: 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day can be calculated by multiplying the total number of packages by his hourly wage: 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks while solving a sudoku puzzle, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time interval at which he drinks a bottle.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes to solve. An extreme sudoku, being 4 times as challenging, takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes to solve.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes, we can calculate the number of bottles he drinks by dividing the total time by the time interval between drinks.

Number of bottles = Total time / Time interval
= 180 minutes / 30 minutes
= 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of balloons is 20 + y.

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3 * y.

The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so we can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

To solve for y, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 18.

Then, we divide both sides by 3: y = 6.

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car requires, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a 30-day period. Given that he drives 100 miles per day, the total distance can be calculated as follows:

Total distance = 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can find the number of tune-ups required by dividing the total distance by 1000.

Number of tune-ups = Total distance / 1000 = 3000 / 1000 = 3

Therefore, Jon's car will require 3 tune-ups in a 30-day period."
"To determine the total hours Bruce works over the three days, we need to calculate his work hours for each day and then sum them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours. 

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours by adding up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the amount of allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

The cost of the cake is $11. The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira purchased, we need to sum the quantities of each type of fruit. 

The number of apples is 3, the number of bananas is 5, and the number of oranges is 6. 

3 + 5 + 6 = 14

However, Lola consumed 2 pieces of the fruit. To find the remaining quantity, we subtract the number of fruits eaten from the total.

14 - 2 = 12

Therefore, there are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To determine the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students participating in each sport and then sum these values.

First, we note that there are 6 students playing tennis. Since the number of students playing volleyball is twice the number playing tennis, we can calculate this as 6 * 2 = 12.

Next, we consider the students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls participating, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we can find the total number of students by adding the number of students playing each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To determine the total profit made by the class, we first need to calculate the total revenue generated from selling the lollipops and the total cost incurred in purchasing them.

The total revenue can be calculated as the product of the number of students, the number of lollipops sold per student, and the price per lollipop. Given that there are 30 students, each selling 10 lollipops at $0.8 per lollipop, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = 30 * 10 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Next, we calculate the total cost, which is the product of the number of students, the number of lollipops sold per student, and the cost per lollipop. With 30 students purchasing 10 lollipops at $0.5 each, the total cost is:

Total cost = 30 * 10 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

The total profit is then obtained by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $240 - $150
Total profit = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats. 

Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, we can calculate the number of dogs by multiplying the number of cats by 3: 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, we find the number of rabbits by subtracting 2 from the number of dogs: 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

The number of fish in the tank is three times the number of rabbits, so we multiply the number of rabbits by 3: 7 * 3 = 21 fish.

Finally, we determine the number of gerbils, which is one-third the number of fish: 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

"To determine the duration for which the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the combined daily consumption of Abby and Josh. Abby consumes 2 slices per day, while Josh consumes twice as much, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices per day.

Their combined daily consumption is 2 + 4 = 6 slices. 

To find the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by their combined daily consumption: 24 / 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To determine the total number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Martha started collecting shells at the age of 5, and by her 10th birthday, she has been collecting for 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of months by multiplying the number of years by 12. 

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

As Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells collected is equal to the total number of months. Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of tea in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups of tea into 3 equal rows, we can calculate this as follows:

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is half of the total cups in each row:

9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups per row

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we must consider the two possible scenarios: 4 or 5 cups of mint tea per row.

If there are 4 mint tea cups in each row, then the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. But this is not the case, as we know the total number of mint tea cups is 15.

If there are 5 mint tea cups in each row, then the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15, which matches the given information.

Therefore, the correct answer is 5 cups of mint tea per row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we first need to calculate the total number of trips he can make within the given time frame. Given that each round trip takes 4 hours, in 8 hours, the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Since the sloth aims to collect a total of 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips, we can calculate the minimum number of berries he needs to pick up per trip by dividing the total number of berries by the number of trips: 24 / 2 = 12 berries per trip.

Therefore, the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to calculate the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and there are 10000 gallons of water in the pool, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of water used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the total amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine the number of movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget. His monthly allowance is $150. 

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on movies. Colby has already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each, which amounts to 5 * $10 = $50. Additionally, he has seen 8 movies on other days at $7 each, totaling 8 * $7 = $56. 

The total spent on popcorn is 2 * $8 = $16, and on candy is 4 * $2 = $8. 

The total amount spent is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Now, we subtract the total spent from his monthly allowance to find the remaining budget: $150 - $130 = $20.

Since Colby wants to see a movie on a Friday, and tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, he can afford to see one more movie on a Friday or Saturday with his remaining budget. This leaves him with $20 - $10 = $10 for other days.

Tickets for other days cost $7, so with $10, he can see 1 more movie on other days.

Therefore, the total number of movies Colby can see is 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's consider the mini cinnamon rolls. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and since a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Given that Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from these pastries are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, we'll consider the mini blueberry muffins. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and since a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version, a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories. With 300 mini blueberry muffins baked, the total calories from these pastries are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Therefore, the total number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is the sum of the Junebugs removed each day: 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.

There are 5 days in total. 

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is the total number of Junebugs removed divided by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60.

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 60."
"To determine the distance each vehicle traveled, we can use the formula distance = speed * time. 

For the bus, with a speed of 60 miles per hour and a travel time of 5 hours, the distance traveled is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

For the car, with a speed of 30 miles per hour and a travel time of 8 hours, the distance traveled is 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

"To find Peter's age, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J.

We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, which can be expressed as P + Pp + J = 100. Additionally, we know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so Pp = J + 10. Furthermore, Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages, which can be expressed as P = Pp + J.

We can use the second equation to substitute Pp in the first equation, resulting in P + (J + 10) + J = 100. Simplifying this equation, we get P + 2J + 10 = 100.

Next, we can use the third equation to substitute P in the equation P + 2J + 10 = 100. However, this equation is an identity, as it states that P is equal to the sum of Pp and J, which is also equal to Pp + J. Therefore, we can use the second equation to substitute Pp in the first equation.

Substituting Pp with J + 10 in the equation P + 2J + 10 = 100, we get (J + 10) + 2J + 10 = 100. Combining like terms, we have 3J + 20 = 100. Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get 3J = 80. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that J = 80/3.

Now that we have Jean's age, we can find Paul's age by substituting J into the equation Pp = J + 10. This gives us Pp = 80/3 + 10. Simplifying, we get Pp = 80/3 + 30/3 = 110/3.

Finally, we can find Peter's age by substituting Pp into the equation P = Pp + J. This gives us P = 110/3 + 80/3. Combining the fractions, we have P = 190/3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{63.33}$"
"To determine the total number of water balloons, we first need to calculate the initial number of balloons. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself, and each of her 4 friends had 2 balloons. The total number of balloons initially is the sum of Maria's balloon and her friends' balloons, which is 1 + 4 * 2 = 9.

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

To find the total number of balloons, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of tables required for the charity yard sale, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of items they have available. 

The charity group receives 10 boxes from each of the 10 people who donate, resulting in a total of 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. Additionally, they already possess 10 boxes, bringing the total number of boxes to 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Given that each table can accommodate 2 boxes, the total number of tables needed is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, the charity group already owns 15 tables. Therefore, they require 30 - 15 = 15 additional tables.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the average total distance spat, we must first calculate the total distance spat by each participant. Zoey's watermelon contains 40 seeds, each of which she spits 10 feet. Therefore, her total distance is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Similarly, Sydney's watermelon contains 35 seeds, each of which she spits 12 feet. Thus, her total distance is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both participants is the sum of their individual distances: 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the total number of seeds spat. Since Zoey spits 40 seeds and Sydney spits 35 seeds, the total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

Therefore, the average total distance spat is 820 feet / 75 seeds = 10.93 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10.93}$"
"To determine the difference in revenue between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. Assuming a 24-hour day and a 30-day month, we can calculate the total number of widgets as follows:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, we can calculate the total revenue from each machine by multiplying the total number of widgets by the price of each widget, which is $6.

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, we can find the difference in revenue by subtracting the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue from the Widgeteer 3000.

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we need to calculate the cost of the 24-hour option and the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos. 

The 12-hour option costs 1000 pesos, and Cameron needs to add 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark. Since he stays for 17 hours, he needs to add 70 * 5 = 350 pesos for the additional 5 hours.

So, the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we must first calculate the amount each sheep requires. Since each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, we can find the amount each sheep needs by subtracting 3 pounds from twice the amount each goat needs.

Twice the amount each goat needs is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. Subtracting 3 pounds from this gives us 10 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately. For the goats, we have 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds. For the sheep, we have 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay required for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{159}$"
"To determine the number of 25 dollar pens John can buy after his expenses, we need to calculate his total earnings, subtract his gas cost and the cost of the pencils, and then divide the remaining amount by the cost of each pen.

First, let's calculate John's total earnings. He earns 50 dollars per hour and worked 6 hours in the week.

Total earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Next, we need to subtract the gas cost and the cost of the pencils from his earnings. The gas cost is 50 dollars, and the cost of 5 pencils at 10 dollars each is 50 dollars.

Remaining money = Total earnings - Gas cost - Cost of pencils
= 300 - 50 - 50
= 200 dollars

Now, we can determine the number of 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money.

Number of pens = Remaining money / Cost of each pen
= 200 / 25
= 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in the words Craig and his brother have spelled, we first need to calculate the total number of letters in the words each of them has spelled.

Craig has spelled 20 words with 15 letters each. The total number of letters in the words he has spelled can be found by multiplying the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother has spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters in the words Craig has spelled to the total number of letters in the words his brother has spelled: 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: 650"
"To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we need to calculate the total number of positions available for the children. Since there are 8 children in each row and there are 7 rows for each of the 5 different schools, we can find the total number of children by multiplying the number of children in each row by the number of rows and then by the number of schools.

The calculation is as follows:

Total number of children = (Number of children in each row) * (Number of rows) * (Number of schools)
Total number of children = 8 * 7 * 5
Total number of children = 280

Therefore, the total number of children participating in the drill is 280."
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. Since there are 29 pupils in the class and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

Next, we calculate the total number of bottles the teacher receives from redeeming her coupons. She has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles she gets is 9 * 100 = 900.

To find the number of bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she received. This gives us 900 - 58 = 842.

The final answer is: $\boxed{842}$"
"To determine the total amount Patty charged for the job, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the visit fee.

The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked by the hourly rate. In this case, the job took 2.25 hours and the labor rate is $35 per hour. Therefore, the labor cost is 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75.

The cost of parts is given as $60. The visit fee is $40.

To find the total cost, we add the labor cost, the cost of parts, and the visit fee together: $78.75 + $60 + $40 = $178.75.

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To determine the amount James was out, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs after the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs is $15 each, so the total cost is 10 * $15 = $150. The discount is 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60. Therefore, the price after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James then sold 5 CDs for $40 each, resulting in a total revenue of 5 * $40 = $200.

To find the net outcome, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $200 - $90 = $110. Since James made a profit, he was not out any money. However, the question seems to imply a loss, which is not the case here.

The final answer is: $110"
"To determine the total earnings from Jen's root crops, we need to calculate the revenue generated from each type of crop and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the yams. With 6 yams sold at $1.5 each, the total revenue from yams is 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the sweet potatoes. With 10 sweet potatoes sold at $2 each, the total revenue from sweet potatoes is 10 * $2 = $20.

Lastly, we calculate the revenue from the carrots. With 4 carrots sold at $1.25 each, the total revenue from carrots is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, we sum the revenues from each type of root crop to find the total earnings: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the time it took James to swim across the lake, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, we calculate the time it took James to swim 60% of the 20-mile lake. To find 60% of 20 miles, we multiply 0.6 by 20.

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Given that James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, we can find the time it took him to swim 12 miles using the formula Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. Since he swam for 6 hours, he rests for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance.

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we first need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread, we can find this by multiplying 70 by 7.

7 * 70 = 490

Now, we are told that the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had. To find the number of loaves the bakery has, we subtract 40 from the result we obtained earlier.

490 - 40 = 450

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: 450"
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to consider the stickers she received and the stickers she lost. Initially, she was given 15 stickers for participating in class. However, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. This results in a net loss of 7 stickers from her initial total.

To find the number of stickers she has after losing 7, we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8

Following this, her teacher gave her 5 additional stickers for helping her classmates. To find the final total, we add 5 to the result of the previous calculation: 8 + 5 = 13

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

13"
"To determine the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times. The formula for commission is given by (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100. For the New York Times, the number of copies sold is 6, the price per copy is $5, and the commission rate is 10%. 

Commission from New York Times = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
Commission from New York Times = 300 / 100
Commission from New York Times = $3

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal. The number of copies sold is 10, the price per copy is $15, and the commission rate is 8%.

Commission from Wall Street Journal = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
Commission from Wall Street Journal = 1200 / 100
Commission from Wall Street Journal = $12

Now, we can find the total commission by adding the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine Leo's age, we can start by establishing the relationship between Deanna's and Marcus's ages. Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:

Deanna's age = 26
Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

Now, we are told that Marcus is half of Leo's age. To find Leo's age, we can multiply Marcus's age by 2:

Leo's age = 2 * Marcus's age
Leo's age = 2 * 21
Leo's age = 42

"To find the number of points Azibo scored, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, which is 20 more than Azibo's score and 10 more points than Dinar's score. This gives us two equations:

B = A + 20
B = D + 10

Since both equations are equal to B, we can set them equal to each other:

A + 20 = D + 10

We can simplify this equation by subtracting 10 from both sides:

A + 10 = D

We also know that the total points scored by the three individuals is 45, so we can write the equation:

B + A + D = 45

Substituting B = A + 20 into this equation, we get:

(A + 20) + A + D = 45

Combine like terms:

2A + D + 20 = 45

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2A + D = 25

Now, we can substitute A + 10 = D into this equation:

2A + (A + 10) = 25

Combine like terms:

3A + 10 = 25

Subtract 10 from both sides:

3A = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

A = 5

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the number of pages per inch and the thickness of the book. Given that each paper is printed on both sides, the effective number of pages per inch is twice the number of pages per inch when considering single-sided printing.

Since there are 100 pages to the inch when stacked, and each page is printed on both sides, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book. The book is 1.5 inches thick, so the total number of pages in the book is 200 * 1.5 = 300 pages.

The final answer is: 300"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 / 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we can find the total number of reports stapled by multiplying the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 reports/set * 60 sets = 1800 reports

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"To determine the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate her total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim's usual sleep schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, her usual sleep time is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her actual wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.

We know that she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we need to calculate her actual sleep time. Her actual sleep time starts at 10 p.m. and ends at 5:55 a.m. This is 7 hours and 55 minutes, which is equivalent to 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her actual sleep time: 455 - 23 = 432 minutes.

The final answer is: 432"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to calculate the initial number of measuring spoons he possesses. Given that he has two dozen measuring cups, we can find the total number of cups by multiplying 2 by 12.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the initial number of spoons by multiplying the number of cups by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the total number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied.

1/5 of 1000 = 200

Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied. 

4/5 of 1000 = 800

Next, we need to calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we multiply 50 by 14 (number of days in 2 weeks).

50 * 14 = 700

Now, we add the number of occupied beds initially to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

200 + 700 = 900

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

1000 - 900 = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to find the number of non-work emails. Since she sends 16 emails a day and 7 of them are work-related, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Next, we calculate the number of emails to family. Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family, which is (2/3) * 9 = 6.

Now, we need to find the number of emails to her boyfriend. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of emails to family from the total non-work emails: 9 - 6 = 3. Then, we find one-third of this number, which is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from the number reported by Courtney.

Let's denote the number reported by Courtney as x. We know that Kelly stated Courtney overstated the number by 20%, which means the actual number is 80% of x. We can express this as 0.8x.

We are given that the number reported by Courtney is 48. So, we can set up the equation 0.8x = 48.

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.8:
x = 48 / 0.8
x = 60

However, this is the number reported by Courtney, which is 20% more than the actual number. To find the actual number, we need to subtract 20% of 60 from 60. We can express 20% as 0.2, so we need to subtract 0.2 * 60 from 60:
60 - 0.2 * 60 = 60 - 12 = 48

However, we know that 48 is the number reported by Courtney, which is 20% more than the actual number. This means that 48 is 120% of the actual number. To find the actual number, we can divide 48 by 1.2:
48 / 1.2 = 40

"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Similarly, since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 4x balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them, which can be expressed as x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried 2x balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the equation 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x
Total number of balls = 7 * 1
Total number of balls = 7

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day by the pirates. 

Let's start by calculating the total number of holes at the end of the first day, which is 10 holes. 

On the second day, the pirates dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

We are given that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

Now, we can find the number of holes dug on the fourth day by subtracting the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

However, this equation is not directly useful for finding the total number of corn chips. Instead, we can use the fact that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, we can express the total number of corn chips as:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15

Substituting x = 70 into the equation, we get:

Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To determine the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The cost of travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

We know that the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so we can write the equation A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, which can be expressed as L = S + 5.

Furthermore, we are given that Stan has caught 13 fewer Pokémon than 4 times the number caught by Adelwolfe, which can be written as S = 4A - 13.

Now, we can substitute the expression for L from the second equation into the first equation: A + S + (S + 5) = 339.

Simplifying this equation, we get A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Next, we can substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the previous equation: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

Expanding and simplifying, we get A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Combining like terms, we have 9A - 21 = 339.

Adding 21 to both sides, we get 9A = 360.

Dividing both sides by 9, we find A = 40.

Now that we know the value of A, we can find the value of S by substituting A into the equation S = 4A - 13: S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

"To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we need to calculate the number of episodes and then multiply it by the length of each episode.

Given that each episode is 20 minutes long, we can infer that the number of episodes is half the length of a single episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

Now, to find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can break down the bird's journey into its constituent parts. The bird travels in a southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, then turns direction and flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour, and finally changes direction and flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.

First, we calculate the distance traveled in the first 10 hours: distance = speed * time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles. Next, we calculate the distance traveled in the last 5 hours: distance = speed * time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles. Lastly, we calculate the distance traveled in the 2 hours: distance = speed * time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Since the bird traveled 36 miles north, we need to subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to find the net distance between the two homes. The net distance is given by the sum of the distances traveled in the first 10 hours and the last 5 hours minus the distance traveled in the 2 hours: net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta received. She made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is equivalent to 12 brownies. Additionally, she received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies, and 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

Next, we need to calculate the number of brownies eaten. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were consumed, which is equivalent to 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, we can find the total number of brownies left over by subtracting the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received.

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we can multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for the synthetic gut racquets. There are 3 racquets to be strung with synthetic gut, and it takes Andy an average of 15 minutes to string each one. Therefore, the total time for synthetic gut racquets is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

Next, we'll calculate the time for the polyester string racquets. There are 5 racquets to be strung with polyester string, and it takes Andy an average of 22 minutes to string each one. Therefore, the total time for polyester string racquets is 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

Lastly, we'll calculate the time for the hybrid racquets. There are 4 racquets to be strung with a hybrid set, and it takes Andy an average of 18 minutes to string each one. Therefore, the total time for hybrid racquets is 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time by adding the time for each type of string together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To determine the total cost of the phones, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first two phones are priced at $600 each, resulting in a total of 2 * $600 = $1200. 

For the remaining two phones, each is half the price of the initial two, which is $600 / 2 = $300. Therefore, the total cost for these two phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Adding the cost of the first two phones to the cost of the remaining two phones, we get $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To determine the total number of players in both teams, we first need to establish the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team.

13 (Carlton's team) + 7 = 20 (Zeke's team)

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players on each team.

20 (Zeke's team) + 13 (Carlton's team) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To determine the total number of wooden slats required for the fence, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the garden is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert requires 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to obtain the total number of slats needed:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges she had initially. Since she bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges she gave away to her mom and sister. She gave each of them 2 boxes, so the total number of boxes given away is 2 + 2 = 4. 

The number of boxes she had left is 12 - 4 = 8. 

Now, we can find the total number of oranges in the remaining boxes: 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of states in both the United States and India, we first need to determine the number of states in each country.

The United States has 50 states. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the United States. To find half of 50, we divide 50 by 2, which equals 25. Then, we add 4 to 25, resulting in 29 states in India.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the United States and India: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

The total cost of the items is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can find the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of cherries Jerry has, we first need to find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's share by subtracting 10 from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract 50 from 60: 60 - 50 = 10.

Given that Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, we can calculate the difference in their shares by subtracting Jerry's total from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total earnings from the fundraiser, we need to calculate the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both Saturday and Sunday, and then multiply these quantities by their respective prices.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G. We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Let's denote the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday as A. Then, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is A - 4.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which means the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

We also know that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. Therefore, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is A - 4 = 15, which implies A = 19.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (G * 6) + (A - 4 * 15) = (10 * 6) + (19 * 15) = 60 + 285 = 345.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (G + 5 * 6) + (A * 15) = (15 * 6) + (19 * 15) = 90 + 285 = 375.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 345 + 375 = 720.

The final answer is: 720"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need for her vacation, we must first calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use. Given that she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day.

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, the total number of times she will reapply sunscreen is 4 times/day * 8 days = 32 times.

Each application of sunscreen requires 1 ounce, so the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 32 ounces.

To find the number of bottles needed, we divide the total amount of sunscreen (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces). 

32 / 8 = 4

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate the discount it receives compared to the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100 and the red car is 40% cheaper, we can determine the price of the red car by subtracting 40% of the blue car's price from its original price.

First, we calculate the discount: 40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40.

Next, we subtract the discount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car: $100 - $40 = $60.

Now that we know the price of the red car, we can find the total cost of both cars by adding their prices together: $100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let E represent Emil's current age, D represent his dad's current age, and B represent his brother's current age.

From the information given, we can form the following equations:

1. E + 5 = D/2 (since Emil will be half the age of his dad when he turns 24)
2. E + 5 = 2B (since Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he turns 24)

We are also given that Emil is currently 19 years old, so E = 19.

Substituting E = 19 into equation 1, we get:
19 + 5 = D/2
24 = D/2
D = 48

Now that we have D, we can substitute it into equation 2 to find B:
19 + 5 = 2B
24 = 2B
B = 12

Now that we have the current ages of Emil's dad and brother, we can find the sum of their ages:
D + B = 48 + 12 = 60

"To determine the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and then sum these values.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players in the class. Given that 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 30 students = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we need to find the number of cheerleaders or band members. Since these students are part of the remaining class after removing the football players, we subtract the number of football players from the total number of students:

30 - 6 = 24 students.

Now, we calculate the number of cheerleaders or band members, which is 25% of the remaining 24 students:

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

To find the total number of students leaving early, we sum the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members:

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie, we need to calculate the sum of their shoe sizes and then divide by 2.

Sophie's shoe size is 5. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, his shoe size is 5 * 5 = 25.

The sum of their shoe sizes is 5 + 25 = 30. To find the average, we divide this sum by 2.

Average shoe size = 30 / 2 = 15

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to calculate the number of plants she can fit in the bed and then multiply that by the cost of each plant.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract 18 inches from the total length of the flower bed for each plant. However, we also need to subtract the width of the plant itself (12 inches) from the remaining length. 

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 18n - 12n = 1320 - 30n.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we can find the brother's daily consumption by dividing 18 by 2.

18 / 2 = 9 pretzels per day

Now, to find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7, as there are 7 days in a week.

9 * 7 = 63 pretzels

The final answer is: 63"
"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then sum them.

First, we calculate the cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses that Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

The 4 sunflowers require 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil, and the 10 carnations require 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil. Therefore, the total amount of soil used for these flowers is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Given that they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the amount of soil left for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can purchase in a year, we first need to calculate her monthly savings. Given that she sets aside 25% of her monthly income, we can find this amount by multiplying her monthly income by 0.25.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000.00. Therefore, her monthly savings are 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find her total annual savings by multiplying her monthly savings by 12: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Now, we can determine the number of pairs of shoes she can purchase in a year by dividing her total annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes, which is $1,000.00: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both tasks simultaneously. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Given that she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, we'll calculate the time it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done concurrently, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 30 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature. 

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. This results in a total cooling effect of 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Next, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. This results in a total cooling effect of 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is the sum of these two values, which is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is the total cooling effect minus the warming effect, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Bill's age and the comet's orbit. We know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. 

Let's denote the time Bill's dad saw the comet as T. Since the comet orbits every 75 years, the time Bill saw the comet for the second time is T + 75.

We are given that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This can be expressed as:

Bill's age at the second sighting = 3 * (Bill's dad's age at the first sighting)

We are also given that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Therefore, the equation becomes:

Bill's age at the second sighting = 3 * 30

Bill's age at the second sighting = 90

Now, we can set up an equation to find the time Bill's dad saw the comet (T):

T + 75 = 90

Solving for T, we get:

T = 15

This means that Bill's dad was 15 years old when Bill was born. Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, we can find Bill's age at birth by subtracting 30 from 30, which is not correct. We need to find Bill's age at the time his dad was 30 years old. 

Bill's age at the time his dad was 30 years old = 30 - (30 - 15) = 30 - 15 = 15

However, this is the age of Bill at the time his dad was 30, not the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet orbits every 75 years, we need to add 75 to Bill's age at the time his dad was 30 to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time = 15 + 75 = 90 - 75 = 15

However, this is incorrect. We need to find Bill's age when his dad was 30, and then add 75 to that age to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Bill's age when his dad was 30 = 15. 

Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time = 15 + 75 = 90. However, this is the age of Bill when the comet was seen for the second time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and sum them together.

Buford writes a check for his electric bill once per month, resulting in 12 checks per year. Similarly, he writes a check for his gas bill once per month, also totaling 12 checks per year.

He also writes checks to the church twice per month, which amounts to 24 checks per year. Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service every three months, or quarterly, resulting in 4 checks per year.

To find the total number of checks, we add the number of checks for each category: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to determine the total number of flights made by the first plane. Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can set up the equation x/2 = 44. Solving for x, we get x = 88.

Now that we know the first plane makes 88 flights, we can find the number of flights to Greece. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we must first calculate the individual howling times.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote, on the other hand, howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we can find the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the age of Wilfred, we can start by expressing the total age of the children as the sum of their individual ages. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. The total age of the children is given as 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro.

The total age of the children can be expressed as: 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

We are also given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

We can simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
3 + 4 + (7 + W) + W = 20
12 + 2W = 20
2W = 8
W = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund.

However, the lawyer's donation is based on the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, excluding the $200 donated by Walter's friend. Therefore, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 remains $2000.

The lawyer will donate 3 times this amount, which is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To determine the number of people in the church next door, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies given to the church. Since each guest at the wedding brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church as a thank you for their assistance. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we can calculate the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, let's consider the total watermelon as a whole, which we can represent as 100 units for simplicity.

Let's denote the amount of watermelon each kid gets as x. Since each adult receives twice as much as each kid, the amount each adult gets is 2x.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each), and the total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Given that the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combining like terms, we get 6x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

Therefore, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33.33}$"
"To determine the amount of time Doctor Jones has available to update his records, we must first calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments. 

The time spent on rounds can be calculated by multiplying the number of inpatients by the time spent per inpatient. In this case, there are 9 inpatients, and each requires 20 minutes of Doctor Jones' time. Therefore, the total time spent on rounds is 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.

Similarly, the time spent on appointments can be calculated by multiplying the number of appointments by the time spent per appointment. There are 10 appointments, each lasting 30 minutes. Thus, the total time spent on appointments is 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

The total time spent on rounds and appointments is the sum of these two values, which is 180 + 300 = 480 minutes.

To convert this total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, 480 minutes is equivalent to 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Since Doctor Jones works a total of 9 hours, we can find the time available for updating his records by subtracting the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours. This gives us 9 - 8 = 1 hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete the process. This includes the time to prepare the cake batter, bake the cake, allow it to cool, and frost it.

The time to prepare the cake batter is 20 minutes, the time to bake the cake is 30 minutes, the time to cool the cake is 2 hours (120 minutes), and the time to frost the cake is 10 minutes. 

The total time required is the sum of these individual times: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required from the desired serving time to find the latest start time. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. Therefore, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total earnings per month are $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter, with a total of 64 chocolate bars and 4 boxes, we have 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars per box. 

For Martha, with a total of 56 chocolate bars and 7 boxes, we have 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars per box.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha by subtracting Martha's amount from Peter's amount: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of female porcupines in the park, we can calculate 3/5 of the total population, which is 50. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. Given that the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep, we can find the volume by multiplying these dimensions together.

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company requires us to multiply the volume by 5.9 to obtain the gallons of water needed, we proceed with this calculation:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow sticks in addition to the given number of red sticks.

We are given that there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

Furthermore, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, which is 14. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the difference in the distances traveled by Matteo and Shandy, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them covered.

Matteo's distance can be calculated by multiplying his speed (55 miles per hour) by the time he traveled (4 hours). This yields a distance of 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

Similarly, Shandy's distance is found by multiplying his speed (45 miles per hour) by the time he traveled (10 hours), resulting in a distance of 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

To find the difference in their distances, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is: $\boxed{230}$"
"To determine the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the information provided into manageable parts.

First, we know that half of the 3000 students are over 16 years old, which gives us 1500 students in this category. Since one-fourth of these students are male, we can calculate the number of male students over 16 as 375. Consequently, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Next, we find that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, totaling 1500 students. Given that one-half of these students are male, we can calculate the number of male students under 16 as 750. Therefore, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16, which gives us 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of laps each individual can run, we need to establish the number of laps each person can complete in one hour.

Bethany's running capacity is given as 10 laps per hour. 

Trey's running capacity is 4 laps more than Bethany's, which is 10 + 4 = 14 laps per hour.

Shaelyn's running capacity is half of Trey's, which is 14 / 2 = 7 laps per hour.

Quinn's running capacity is 2 laps fewer than Shaelyn's, which is 7 - 2 = 5 laps per hour.

To find the difference in the number of laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's capacity from Bethany's: 10 - 5 = 5 laps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

The amount of water remaining in the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% in the last 3 hours. To find the charge remaining after 8 hours, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the charge remaining after 8 hours is y. Then, the charge lost in the last 3 hours is y - 28%. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

So, we can set up the equation: y - 28% = 6%.

Solving for y, we get y = 34%.

Now, we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%. We also know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%. To find the initial charge, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the first 5 hours.

The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 34% = 21%.

So, we can set up the equation: x - 21% = 34%.

Solving for x, we get x = 55%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 55%.

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15, resulting in a total hourly earnings of $25.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. To calculate this, we multiply the cost of the car by the percentage she wants to save: 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we can determine the number of weeks she needs to work by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2

Therefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can purchase, we must first calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already acquired. 

The cost of 3 peaches at $0.5 each is 3 * $0.5 = $1.5. 
The cost of 4 pears at $0.5 each is 4 * $0.5 = $2. 
The cost of 2 kiwis at $1 each is 2 * $1 = $2. 
The cost of 5 apples at $0.75 each is 5 * $0.75 = $3.75.

The total cost of the fruits he has already purchased is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25.

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

To find out how many plums he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to calculate the total number of packs she gave away. Since she kept 2 packs out of 15, the number of packs given away is 15 - 2 = 13.

Now, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends to find out how many packs each friend received. This is calculated as 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we can find the total number of pieces in 1.3 packs by multiplying 0.3 packs by 60 pieces per pack. This gives us 0.3 * 60 = 18 pieces.

Therefore, each friend received 1 pack (60 pieces) plus 18 pieces, which equals 78 pieces.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the price of carrots after three years, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The price of carrots increases by 5% every year, which can be represented by the formula:

P(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^t

where P(t) is the price after t years, P0 is the initial price, r is the annual growth rate (0.05 for 5%), and t is the number of years.

Given the initial price P0 = $120 and the growth rate r = 0.05, we can calculate the price after three years:

P(3) = 120 * (1 + 0.05)^3
= 120 * (1.05)^3
= 120 * 1.157625
= 139.145

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we first need to find the number of pictures in each album. Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and distributed them evenly across 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Given that 3 albums were dedicated to selfies, the total number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums - 2 portrait albums = 3 albums. 
The number of portraits is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 portraits.

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies is 27 selfies + 27 portraits = 54.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the total time James spends reading, we need to calculate the number of sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set.

Given that James reads 18 pages in total, we divide this by the number of pages per set, which is 3. This yields 18 / 3 = 6 sets.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we multiply the number of sets by the time per set: 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, resulting in 76 - 15 = 61 guests remaining.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. Therefore, the number of guests remaining is 61 + 30 = 91.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, bringing the total number of guests to 91 + 7 = 98.

"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of small and large stuffed animals sold. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'. Given that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, we can express this relationship as x = 2y.

Next, we need to consider the pricing of the stuffed animals. The price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is three times that of a small one, which is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. This can be represented by the equation 4x + 12y = 120.

Substituting x = 2y into the equation 4x + 12y = 120, we get 4(2y) + 12y = 120. Simplifying this, we have 8y + 12y = 120, which further simplifies to 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20, yielding y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2, giving us x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches the family consumes in one week, we need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

The family's daily consumption can be calculated by adding the individual daily consumption of each family member: the man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total daily consumption is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the total weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7: 11 * 7 = 77 sandwiches.

The final answer is: 77"
"To determine the amount of money Suzanne has left from her earnings, we need to calculate her total revenue and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her revenue from selling cookies. Since she sold 80 cookies at $1 each, her revenue from cookies is 80 * $1 = $80.

Next, we'll calculate her revenue from selling cupcakes. With 60 cupcakes sold at $4 each, her revenue from cupcakes is 60 * $4 = $240.

Now, we'll add her revenue from cookies and cupcakes to find her total revenue: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount she gave away is 2 * $10 = $20.

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total revenue: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we can start by calculating the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since there are two Smith twins and each found 30 eggs, the total number of eggs found by the twins is 30 * 2 = 60.

Next, we know that all the eggs except 10 were found by the friends and the Smith twins. This implies that the total number of eggs found by the friends and the twins is 100 - 10 = 90.

Now, we can find the number of eggs found by the friends by subtracting the number of eggs found by the twins from the total number of eggs found by the friends and the twins. Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is 90 - 60 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days, we need to calculate the daily ore production of a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up to the entire group.

First, let's establish the daily ore production of a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day. 

Now, to find the daily ore production with a steel pickaxe, we need to calculate 50% more than the iron pickaxe production. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. Therefore, with a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

To find the daily ore production of 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, we multiply the daily production of a single dwarf by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds per day.

Finally, to find the monthly ore production, we multiply the daily production by the number of days in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43200}$"
"To determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can establish a proportionality relationship between the given prices and the corresponding number of sandwiches. 

Let's consider the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3 and the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6. We can express the price per sandwich for each package as follows:

For the first package: 3/2 = $1.5 per sandwich
For the second package: 6/4 = $1.5 per sandwich

Since the prices are proportional, we can infer that the price per sandwich remains constant across all packages. 

Now, we can calculate the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: 1.5 * 8 = $12.

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the monthly payment for the bedroom set, we first need to calculate the remaining balance after Tom sells his old bedroom set for $1000.

The total cost of the bedroom set is $3000, and Tom pays $1000 from the sale of his old bedroom set. Therefore, the remaining balance is:

$3000 - $1000 = $2000

Next, we need to calculate the monthly payment, which is 10% of the remaining balance. To find 10% of a number, we multiply it by 0.10.

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to consider the changes in the number of balloons at each stage.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst due to the gust of wind. This means 40% of 25 red balloons were lost, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 balloons. Therefore, the number of red balloons remaining is 25 - 10 = 15.

Next, the loud sound startled Sally, causing her to release half of the yellow balloons. This results in the loss of 1/2 * 12 = 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

As Sally approached the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree. She then added 75% of these blue balloons to her collection. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 0.75 by 8, which equals 6. Therefore, Sally added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, we can calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school by adding the remaining red, green, yellow, and blue balloons: 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34.

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

To find the probability of having to turn in his homework, we need to subtract the probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100%. However, the probability of not having to turn in his homework is 102%, which is not possible. This is because probabilities cannot be greater than 100%. 

To find the probability of having to turn in his homework, we need to subtract the probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100%. However, we can't subtract 102% from 100% directly. We can subtract 100% from 102% to get 2%. However, we can't subtract 2% from 100% directly. We can add 100% to -2% to get 98%. 

The probability of having to turn in his homework is 98%.

"To determine the number of tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to calculate the available seating in the Fine Arts Center after accounting for the reserved seats for graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we can find the number of tickets each graduate can receive by dividing the available seats by the number of graduates.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we cannot distribute a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, considering the context of the question, it seems that the remaining tickets are intended for guests. Therefore, each graduate can give 5 tickets to their friends and family.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. We are given that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. This implies that the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is 2 * 75 = 150.

Furthermore, we are told that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. To find the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we can set up a proportion. Let x be the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Then, 3x = 150, since 3 small beans are equivalent to 1 medium-sized bean.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small jelly beans.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine Melissa's hourly pay after expenses, we need to calculate her net earnings and then divide that by the total number of hours she worked.

Total earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days
Total earnings = $15 * 3
Total earnings = $45

Next, we need to calculate her total expenses: 
Total expenses = Daily expenses * Number of days
Total expenses = $3 * 3
Total expenses = $9

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Melissa worked for 6 hours a day for 3 days, so we need to find the total number of hours she worked: 
Total hours = Hours per day * Number of days
Total hours = 6 * 3

"To determine the time it takes for Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn and then divide that by his new income.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in college. The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000. Additionally, he lost 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000 in income. Therefore, the total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

"To find the share of the first person, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

Therefore, the share of the first person is $420.

"To determine the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is equivalent to 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert this fraction to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

To find the total hours worked by each painter, we divide the total hours by the number of painters: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{47.25}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

To simplify the equation, we can multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

P(t) = P0 * (1 - r)^t

where P(t) is the price at time t, P0 is the initial price, r is the depreciation rate, and t is the time in years.

Given that the initial price of the car is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% or 0.21, and the time period is from 2007 to 2010 (3 years), we can plug in the values into the formula:

P(3) = 20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
= 20000 * (0.79)^3
= 20000 * 0.4914
= 9828

The final answer is: $9828"
"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we first need to calculate the number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, which is 50 / 2 = 25 books. 
10% of the books are written in German, which is 50 * 0.1 = 5 books.

The total number of books written in English and German is 25 + 5 = 30 books. 
Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive, we can subtract the distance she has already covered from the total distance between San Diego, California, and New York City, New York.

The total distance between the two cities is approximately 1955 kilometers. Bernice has driven 325 kilometers over the course of 4 days.

To find the remaining distance, we perform the following calculation:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance driven
= 1955 - 325
= 1630 kilometers

Therefore, Bernice will still need to drive 1630 kilometers to reach her destination."
"To determine the amount of water Ingrid drinks in gallons over a 30-day period, we first need to calculate the total number of cups she consumes in that timeframe. 

Given that Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water daily, we can find the total cups consumed over 30 days by multiplying her daily consumption by the number of days: 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Next, we convert the total cups to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per gallon: 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we can break down the process step by step.

Initially, there are 120 people on the train. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, increasing the total to 140.

At the second stop, 50 people get off the train, and 100 people board. This results in a net increase of 50 people, bringing the total to 140 + 50 = 190.

Finally, at the third stop, 80 people get off the train, leaving 190 - 80 = 110 people on the train.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To determine the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

First, let's consider the cost of the tank top, which is $10. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so their cost is $10 + $5 = $15.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the tennis shoes. They were originally priced at $48 but were on sale for half price. To find the sale price, we divide the original price by 2: $48 / 2 = $24.

The athletic socks cost $8, and Alison had a coupon for $2 off. To find the final cost of the socks, we subtract the coupon value from the original price: $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To determine the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we calculate the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, and each tile covers 1 SqFt. Therefore, we need 200 tiles.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To determine James' annual insurance cost, we first need to calculate the increased cost due to the accident. This can be done by finding 60% of the normal monthly cost and adding it to the normal cost.

The normal monthly cost is $120. To find 60% of this amount, we multiply $120 by 0.6.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Now, we add this increased amount to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost.

Increased monthly cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies than on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

In one weekend, they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by 4: 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the cumulative number of stickers he collected over the past three years.

Initially, Leo had 100 stickers in his collection two years ago. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, bringing his total to 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. Therefore, his current total is 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

To find the total number of stickers in his collection, we add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 250 = 500 stickers.

The final answer is: 500"
"To determine the number of days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total daily consumption of cat food and then divide the total amount of cat food available by this value.

Imma feeds her 3 cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food per meal. Therefore, the total daily consumption of cat food per cat is 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams. Since there are 3 cats, the total daily consumption is 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we can divide the total amount of cat food available (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams) to find the number of days it will last: 720 / 360 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the total number of slices available. Since each pizza has 8 slices and there are 4 pizzas, the total number of slices is 8 * 4 = 32.

We are given that Becky ate 10 slices. It is also stated that Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Furthermore, Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, which means Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we add the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the expenses associated with the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

First, let's consider the cost of the cast, which is a fixed expense of $200.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the 30-minute visit. Since the doctor charges $300 per hour, we need to convert the 30-minute visit to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours. Therefore, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is calculated by multiplying the number of pills by the cost per pill. In this case, Hannah needs 30 painkillers at $4 per pill, so the total cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost of parking, which is a minimum of 2 hours at $6 per hour. Therefore, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The final answer is: $482"
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate the number of emails he doesn't respond to. This can be found by taking 20% of the total daily emails.

20% of 80 emails is calculated as 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the remaining emails, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

To find the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the daily responses by 5.

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

The final answer is: 320"
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then sum these values.

On Monday, 32 classes visited. 
On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited, which is 2 * 32 = 64 classes.
On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, which is 3 * 32 = 96 classes.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's calculate the total number of classes that visited by adding the classes from each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

The final answer is: 207"
"To calculate the average score, we need to find the total sum of the scores and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are 100, 100, 100, and 80. 

First, we add up the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 0.7 by 20, which equals 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total cost for the small coupons. The number of small coupons is 700, and each costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

Next, we'll calculate the total cost for the big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, we can find the total cost of postage by adding the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"To determine the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained, we first need to calculate the initial number of meatball sub sandwiches ordered by Sidney. Since Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, we can express this as an equation:

Initial number of sub sandwiches = 10 - 3
Initial number of sub sandwiches = 7

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the initial order is:

Total initial meatballs = Initial number of sub sandwiches * 4
Total initial meatballs = 7 * 4
Total initial meatballs = 28

Mark then ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches. Sidney subsequently ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, bringing the total number of remaining sub sandwiches to 3 + 3 = 6.

Now, we can calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:

Total remaining meatballs = 6 * 4
Total remaining meatballs = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to calculate the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the trucks were affected, we can find this by multiplying the total number of trucks by 1/4.

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4)
= 20 * 0.25
= 5

Now, we can find the number of trucks that successfully reached the farmers by subtracting the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks.

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = Total number of trucks - Number of trucks with mechanical failures
= 20 - 5
= 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is the product of the number of trucks that reached the farmers and the tons per truck.

Total tons of fertiliser = Number of trucks that reached the farmers * Tons per truck
= 15 * 20
= 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To determine the total cost of the butter, we need to consider the promotion offered by the grocery store. The promotion states that for every pound of butter purchased, the second pound is half off. 

Given that Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can break this down into sets of 2 pounds. Since the promotion applies to every 2 pounds, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For every 2 pounds of butter, the cost is $4.00 for the first pound and $2.00 for the second pound (half off).
- The total cost for 2 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.
- Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the cost of 2 pounds by 3 (the number of sets of 2 pounds in 6 pounds).

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter is 3 * $6.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To determine the total cost of the party, we first need to calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20. Kayla invited her 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, totaling 45 individuals. However, 4 of these guests were unable to attend, leaving 41 guests. Since the initial 20 guests are already accounted for, the number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost per additional guest is $6, so the total cost for these additional guests is 21 * 6 = $126. Adding the initial rental fee of $125, the total cost of the party is $126 + $125 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the amount of money Maggie and Riza have left after spending a portion of their initial $60.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Maggie had as M and the initial amount of money Riza had as R. We know that M = R = $60.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her initial amount left. Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is (3/4)M = (3/4)($60) = $45.

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her initial amount left. Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is (2/3)R = (2/3)($60) = $40.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have: $45 + $40 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to establish the daily consumption of the first two monkeys. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, while the second monkey consumes 4 more bananas than the first, which equates to 14 bananas per day.

Given that the total number of bananas is 315 and they last for a week, we can calculate the daily consumption by dividing the total number of bananas by 7. This yields 315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, we can calculate the combined daily consumption of the first two monkeys: 10 (first monkey) + 14 (second monkey) = 24 bananas. To find the number of bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the combined consumption of the first two monkeys from the total daily consumption: 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 
Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 pieces. 
So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"To determine the number of quarters Jenny leaves with after purchasing the roses, we first need to calculate the total cost of the flowers. Since she buys 15 roses, it's more cost-effective to purchase them by the dozen. 

15 roses can be broken down into 1 dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses. The cost of 1 dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6. Therefore, the total cost of the roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrives with 5 $5 bills, totaling $25. To find the change she receives, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue generated from each item and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the revenue from milkshakes. Since Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, the total revenue from milkshakes is 6 * $5.50 = $33.

Next, we calculate the revenue from burger platters. With 9 platters sold at $11 each, the total revenue from platters is 9 * $11 = $99.

Lastly, we determine the revenue from sodas. Terry sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each, resulting in a total revenue of 20 * $1.50 = $30.

To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we add the revenues from each item together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. Therefore, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of weeks Melanie needs to collect 200 toothpicks, we first calculate the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far. Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week and has been doing so for 12 weeks, the total number of toothpicks saved is:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Given that she requires 200 toothpicks in total, we can find the number of toothpicks she still needs by subtracting the number she already has from the total:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take her to save the remaining toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is 0.75 * 2000 = $1500.

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is 1.2 * 1500 = $1800.

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price he paid, which is 2000 - 1800 = $200.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: (200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we first need to calculate the total number of seconds in the given time frame. There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame.

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, and there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72,000.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To determine Frankie's bowling score, we first need to calculate twice Binkie's score. Given that Binkie bowled a score of 90, we can find this value by multiplying 90 by 2.

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Next, we are told that Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score. To find Frankie's score, we add 15 to the value we calculated earlier.

Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

"To determine the total time James spent walking, we must first calculate the total distance he traveled. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back, the total distance is twice the distance to the store, which is 2 * 4 = 8 miles.

Given that James walks at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk 8 miles by dividing the total distance by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

Therefore, the time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by purchasing bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in both scenarios.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 40.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To determine the rate at which the crocodile grows per year, we can divide the total growth in inches by the number of years it took to achieve that growth. 

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can calculate the total growth in 13 years by multiplying the growth per year by the number of years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

Let's start by finding the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we need to consider the production rate of the farmer and the collection rate of the truck. The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, while the truck collects 3 bales per hour.

Given that both the farmer and the truck operate for 6 hours, we can calculate the total production and collection as follows:

- Total production: 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales
- Total collection: 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the total collection from the total production: 30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and the additional minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total minutes John spends in class. Since he has 6 periods per day and each period is 40 minutes long, we can calculate the total minutes per day as follows:

6 periods/day * 40 minutes/period = 240 minutes/day

Since John attends classes for 5 days a week, we can find the total minutes per week by multiplying the minutes per day by the number of days:

240 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1200 minutes/week

In addition to his regular classes, John also takes 2 extra classes, each lasting 40 minutes. We can calculate the total minutes spent in these extra classes as follows:

2 classes * 40 minutes/class = 80 minutes/day
80 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 400 minutes/week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes:

1200 minutes/week + 400 minutes/week = 1600 minutes/week

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. Since he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

1/16 * 7 days/week * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 1/16 * 10080 minutes/week
= 630 minutes/week

Since John spends this additional time on both Saturday and Sunday, we can multiply the result by 2:

630 minutes/week * 2 = 1260 minutes/week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes, and the extra minutes for Saturday and Sunday:

1600 minutes/week + 1260 minutes/week = 2860 minutes/week

Finally, we can convert the total minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

2860 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 47.67 hours/week

The final answer is: 47.67"
"To determine the height of the bouncy ball on its second bounce, we need to consider the height of the initial drop and the subsequent bounces. The mall has a three-story balcony, with each story being 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial height of the ball is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

When the ball bounces, it reaches 2/3 of its previous height. So, after the first bounce, the ball reaches a height of 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we apply the same 2/3 ratio to the height after the first bounce: 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the height of the ball on its second bounce is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child step by step.

First, we convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the total earnings of the apple orchard, we first need to calculate the number of bags of apples sold. Given that each bag contains 10 apples and the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples, we can find the number of bags by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag.

Number of bags = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag.

Total earnings = Number of bags * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we can work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate. 

Let's denote the original weight of the triceratops as x. When the T-Rex ate half of it, the remaining weight was x/2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of this remaining weight, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4. We are given that this remaining weight is 270 kilograms. 

Setting up the equation, we have x/4 = 270. To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4, resulting in x = 270 * 4 = 1080. However, this is the weight of the triceratops after the T-Rex ate. Since the T-Rex ate half of the original weight, the original weight of the triceratops is 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2160}$"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we must first calculate the total area of the walls. The north and south walls, each measuring 10 feet by 8 feet, have a combined area of 2 * (10 * 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls, each measuring 5 feet by 8 feet, have a combined area of 2 * (5 * 8) = 80 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Given that a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons required to paint the room is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons. Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost of painting the room is 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of her selecting a shaken can out of the remaining options.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas, of which 3 were shaken. After taking 1 unshaken soda for herself, there were 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas left. Ellen's brother then took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, resulting in 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Given that there are now 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken, the probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the ratio of the number of shaken cans to the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 14.29%."
"To determine the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

The first train is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, its distance traveled can be calculated as speed multiplied by time, which is 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, its distance traveled is 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of their individual distances, which is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the total number of people Billy helps, we first need to calculate the number of days he is available to volunteer. The period in question spans from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th, resulting in a total of 31 + 19 = 50 days.

However, Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find the number of days he is not working, we calculate 20% of 50:
0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy is available to help:
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can assist 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

To find the total number of people Billy helps, we multiply the number of days he is available by the number of people he can help per day:
40 * 6 = 240

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of individuals transported by the buses and the private cars. 

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses. There were 12 buses, each carrying 35 people. Therefore, the total number of people transported by the buses is 12 * 35 = 420.

Next, we calculate the total number of people transported by the private cars. There were 20 private cars, each carrying 3 people. Therefore, the total number of people transported by the private cars is 20 * 3 = 60.

Now, we add the number of people transported by the buses and the private cars to find the total number of people transported: 420 + 60 = 480.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can infer that the number of people inside the church is equal to the number of people transported, assuming that all individuals present were transported by the buses or private cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine Jeff's age, we can start by establishing the age of his sister, Martha. Given that Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than him, we can calculate her age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, we can calculate his age by adding 10 to Martha's age:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the time it takes to ride each waterslide, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

For the biggest waterslide, which is 300 feet long and has a speed of 60 feet per minute, the time it takes to ride is 300 / 60 = 5 minutes.

For the second biggest waterslide, which is 240 feet long and has a speed of 80 feet per minute, the time it takes to ride is 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

To find the difference in time between the two slides, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 - 3 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. Adding this to the 30-minute lunch, we get a total of 30 + 30 = 60 minutes spent per day on lunch and breaks.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, the total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of miles Ahito ran, we first need to calculate the total miles run by Micah. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can find Micah's distance by multiplying 8 by 3.5.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we can find Ahito's miles by subtracting the combined distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance of 52 miles.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to consider the initial charge, the return, and the subsequent purchases.

First, let's calculate the initial balance after the return. The initial charge was $85.00, and Sheila returned an item worth $15.00. The new balance is therefore $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels after the discount. The frying pan was originally $20.00, but it was on sale for 20% off. The discount is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. Therefore, the price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Similarly, the set of towels was originally $30.00, but it was on sale for 10% off. The discount is 10% of $30.00, which is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. Therefore, the price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the new purchases is $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00.

Finally, we add the total cost of the new purchases to the initial balance after the return to find the new balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 

We are given that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. This implies that the remaining two-thirds of the large jellyfish do not change color. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are also given that when a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. This means that x/15 = 6.

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 15:
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine Caroline's age, we can establish a series of relationships between the individuals' ages. Let's denote Chris's age as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A.

Given that Chris is 4 years old, we can express Ben's age in terms of Chris's age as B = 2C. Substituting the known value of C, we get B = 2(4) = 8.

Now, we are given that Caroline is three times older than Ben. This relationship can be expressed as A = 3B. Substituting the known value of B, we get A = 3(8) = 24.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, we must first calculate the total amount she needs to save. Given that she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000 in retirement, her annual retirement income will be 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Next, we calculate her annual savings rate, which is 20% of her current annual salary. This is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find the number of years she needs to work to save $800,000 at a rate of $20,000 per year, we divide the total savings needed by her annual savings: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the length of each final cut, we need to perform a two-step division process. 

First, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into. The total length of the ribbon is 100 centimeters, and it will be cut into 4 equal parts. Therefore, we calculate 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm.

Next, we divide the result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into. Since each of the 4 parts will be divided into 5 equal parts, we calculate 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm.

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the given information that 40% of the population is comprised of 240 boys. 

First, we convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40% = 0.4

Then, we divide the number of boys by this decimal to find the total number of students: 240 / 0.4 = 600

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

"To determine the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to calculate the distance of a round trip and then multiply it by the number of times he visits his parents in a month.

First, we calculate the distance of a one-way trip using the formula Distance = Speed * Time. Given that John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to reach his parents, the one-way distance is:

Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the trip is round-trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2 to get the total distance for a single visit:

Total Distance per Visit = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance per Visit = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the total distance per visit by 2 to get the total distance driven in a month:

Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to calculate the total distance Sofie will cover in the same time frame. Given that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, her total distance in 7 days can be calculated as follows:

Distance = Daily Distance * Number of Days
Distance = 10 miles/day * 7 days
Distance = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, Brian's distance can be calculated by dividing Sofie's total distance by 2:

Brian's Distance = Sofie's Distance / 2
Brian's Distance = 70 miles / 2
Brian's Distance = 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the four workers in a 10-hour shift. Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. Similarly, the other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, resulting in a combined production rate of 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. The total production rate for these four workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Over a 10-hour period, the total number of toys produced by these four workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys. Since the manufacturer still needs 20 additional toys to fulfill the order, the total number of toys required is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. Consequently, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining 420 - 200 = 220 toys.

Given that the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, we can calculate their production rate as follows: 220 toys / 10 hours = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we first need to calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we can calculate its weight by dividing 60 by 4. This gives us 60 / 4 = 15 pounds for Elijah's first dog.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds. Therefore, we can calculate its weight by dividing 60 by 2, resulting in 30 pounds for Elijah's second dog.

Now, we can find the total weight of Elijah's dogs by adding the weights of his two dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weight of Elijah's dogs to the weight of Kory's dog: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, we can work backwards from the information given. We know that Kris had 7 stickers, which is half of what Luis had. This implies that Luis had 7 * 2 = 14 stickers.

Since Luis had 14 stickers, which is half of what Seth had, we can conclude that Seth had 14 * 2 = 28 stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 28 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 28"
"To determine the total number of small bags John can make, we first need to calculate the total number of M&M's he has. Since each large bag weighs 10 ounces and contains 30 M&M's per ounce, we can find the total number of M&M's by multiplying the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Given that John buys 3 large bags, the total number of M&M's is calculated as follows:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, to find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag, which is 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the circumference of the earth. The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. 

Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Now, we can calculate the number of days it will take Alfie to fly this distance by dividing the total distance (20,000 km) by the distance he flies per day (400 km).

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to establish a relationship between the speeds of the average car, the 2nd fastest car, and the fastest car.

Given that the average car can travel at 120 miles per hour, we know the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we are told that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the fastest car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25: 600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour.

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To determine Vince's current age, we can start by establishing the relationship between Liam's and Vince's ages two years ago. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, which can be expressed as:

Liam's age two years ago = 2 * Vince's age two years ago
14 = 2x

To find Vince's age two years ago, we can solve for 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 14 / 2
x = 7

Now that we know Vince's age two years ago, we can find his current age by adding 2 years to his age at that time:

Vince's current age = Vince's age two years ago + 2
Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can say A = M.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so C + S = 30.

Additionally, we are given that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, which can be expressed as C = S + 12.

We can use the second equation to substitute S in the first equation, giving us C + S = 30, which becomes (S + 12) + S = 30.

Simplifying this equation, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we must first calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately, then sum these values.

The total weight of the crayons can be found by multiplying the number of crayons by the weight of each crayon. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Next, we need to determine the number of boxes required to hold the crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total amount John makes from selling the planks, we first need to calculate the number of logs he can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Next, we divide the total feet of usable wood by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, we multiply the number of logs by 5 to find the total number of planks.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

Finally, we calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank, which is $1.2.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate their individual salaries and then sum them up.

First, let's determine Valerie's brother's salary. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's salary as 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Next, we calculate their combined salary by adding Valerie's and her brother's salaries: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Now, we know that their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the equation for the time spent walking on the beach. Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach can be calculated as distance/speed = 2/x. This is equal to 40 minutes. So, we have the equation 2/x = 40.

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Next, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of additional weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60, we first calculate the total amount she has saved so far. Given that she saves $4 per week for 8 weeks, the total amount saved is:

Total Amount Saved = Weekly Savings * Number of Weeks
Total Amount Saved = $4/week * 8 weeks
Total Amount Saved = $32

Next, we need to find the remaining amount she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:

Remaining Amount = Goal Amount - Total Amount Saved
Remaining Amount = $60 - $32
Remaining Amount = $28

Since Jane continues to save $4 per week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining amount:

Number of Additional Weeks = Remaining Amount / Weekly Savings
Number of Additional Weeks = $28 / $4/week
Number of Additional Weeks = 7 weeks

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total number of blue birds in the trees, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group and then sum them up.

First, let's consider the trees with 7 blue birds each. There are 3 such trees, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 * 7 = 21.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each. The total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 * 4 = 8.

Lastly, there is 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

To find the total number of blue birds, we add the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have a total of 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. Therefore, we can write the equation as x + 24 = 60.

To find the value of 'x', we can subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 60 - 24 = 36. This means that Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Now, we are asked to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles: 36 - 10 = 26.

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we can use the concept of weighted averages. When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces.

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x. The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. The total temperature of the water in the bottle is then (33 + x) / 2 * 5.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40.

Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 / 2 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 >= 80
165 + 5x >= 80
5x >= 80 - 165
5x >= -85
x >= -85 / 5
x >= -17

However, since x represents a temperature, it must be a positive value. Therefore, we can conclude that the minimum temperature of the second bottle is at least 40 degrees.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, Melanie's father has 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 21 days in three weeks, the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows. Therefore, the total number of cows is 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows.

Similarly, Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. The total number of chickens added in three weeks is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens. Consequently, the total number of chickens is 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the total number of cows and the total number of chickens, which is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To determine the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels before the discount is applied. Since each pack costs $10.00 and there are 4 packs, the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Next, we need to find the amount of the discount. A 10% discount on $40.00 is calculated as 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00. Subtracting this discount from the total cost gives us the discounted cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Since each pack contains 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"To determine the number of potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to establish the relationship between scoops of mashed potatoes and the number of potatoes required to make them. It is given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's denote the number of potatoes required to make 1 less than 3 scoops as 'x'. Then, we have the equation: x = 6 - 3, which simplifies to x = 3. This means it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we are given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. Therefore, the number of scoops Gomer ate is 23 - 5 = 18.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, we can find the number of potatoes Gomer ate by first determining how many groups of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops. This can be calculated as 18 / 2 = 9. 

Since each group of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is 9 * 3 = 27.

"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
The total number of eggs in this period is given by the product of the daily consumption and the number of days: 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day. 
The total number of eggs in this period is given by the product of the daily consumption and the number of days: 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs is the sum of the eggs consumed in the two periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To find the number of dozens of eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as 1 dozen equals 12 eggs: 240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens.

"To determine the total number of sunflowers sold by Faraday, we need to calculate the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets and individual sunflowers separately and then sum them up.

First, let's find the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets. Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers and Faraday sells 7 bouquets per day, the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is:

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Next, we calculate the number of sunflowers sold from individual sunflowers. Given that each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earns $26 from individual sunflowers per day, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets and individual sunflowers:

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we multiply the daily total by 3:

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he purchases, the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory, and then find the difference between the two.

First, we calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy with his initial investment of $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Next, we find the number of rocks Adam sells, which is 60% of his total inventory:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * 7 = 84

Now, we calculate the cost of the rocks Adam buys:

20 * 5 = 100

However, since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * 5 = 40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

100 + 40 = 140

To find the amount of money Adam loses, we subtract the revenue from the total cost:

140 - 84 = 56

"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the relationships between the number of seashells collected by each person. Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carrey as R, the number collected by Carlos as C, and the number collected by Jim as J.

We are given that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so we can express this as J = C + 5. We also know that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can substitute this value into the equation to get 27 = C + 5.

Solving for C, we get C = 22. This means that Carlos collected 22 seashells.

We are also given that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. This can be expressed as C = 2R. Substituting the value of C, we get 22 = 2R. Solving for R, we find that R = 11.

Now that we know the number of seashells collected by each person, we can find the total number of seashells: J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.

To find out how many seashells each person gets when they divide the total number of seashells equally among themselves, we divide the total by 3: 60 / 3 = 20.

"To determine the total profit earned by Linus, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then sum them together.

First, let's calculate the profit from Monday. Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each, resulting in a total cost price of 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. Therefore, the total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

Next, we calculate the profit from Tuesday. Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each, resulting in a total cost price of 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. Therefore, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we must first establish the height of each individual involved. Given that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now that we have Carl's height, we can determine the length of his cane, which is half his height:

"To determine the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the number of bottles required to cover the daily energy needs of one person. Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we can find this by dividing 100% by 20%, which is equivalent to dividing 1 by 0.20. This gives us 1 / 0.20 = 5 bottles per person.

Now, to find the total number of bottles required to cover the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we multiply the number of bottles per person by the total number of people: 5 * 2300 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find the difference between the required production and the current production. This can be calculated as 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

Therefore, Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles per day to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first determine the number of babies wearing purple and bows, and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total. 

Number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2

Since 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, we can calculate the number of babies wearing purple and bows as follows:
Number of babies wearing purple and bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2

The number of babies wearing blue and bows is given as 2. Therefore, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
Total number of babies wearing bows: 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To find the number of tax reports received on Wednesday, we can use a simple subtraction method. 

First, let's calculate the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, we can find the total number of reports received on these two days: 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Next, we subtract this total from the overall number of reports received last week to find the number of reports received on Wednesday.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: $\boxed{1125}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, let's consider the initial sale. Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Since half of 80 is 40, he sold 40 square meters for $50. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since 1/4 of 80 is 20, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine Geb's age, we first need to calculate half of Haley's age. Given that Haley is 26 years old, we can find this by dividing her age by 2.

Haley's age: 26
Half of Haley's age: 26 / 2 = 13

Now, we are told that Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. To find Geb's age, we subtract 10 from the calculated half of Haley's age.

Geb's age: 13 - 10 = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"To determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the total number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2.

6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each participant and then subtract this from the initial number of eggs hidden.

First, let's establish the number of eggs found by each person. Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy, being twice as successful as Lamar, finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie, who finds 2 fewer eggs than Stacy, finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Lastly, Mei, who finds half as many eggs as Charlie, finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, we sum the total number of eggs found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Initially, Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is equivalent to 12, 3 dozen is equivalent to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we first need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects from. The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% larger than this combined total. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 0.6 by 400, which equals 240. Adding this to 400 gives us 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we know the third complex has 640 apartments. The total number of apartments John collects from is the sum of the apartments in all three complexes: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, he collects from 1440 * 3 = 4320 apartments per week.

Given that he gets paid $0.40 per collection, his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"To determine the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

Let's start by calculating the production of the tree for each year:

- Year 1 (5 years old): The tree produces 50 fruits.
- Year 2 (6 years old): The tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- Year 3 (7 years old): The tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- Year 4 (8 years old): The tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits, the 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- Year 5 (9 years old): The tree does not produce any fruits.
- Year 6 (10 years old): The tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 1550

The final answer is: 1550"
"To determine the amount of money Jack has after Sophia gives him 1/5 of her $100, we first need to calculate the amount Sophia gives to Jack. 

1/5 of $100 can be calculated as $100 divided by 5, which equals $20. 

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We are given that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, which can be expressed as R = 4B. We are also given that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, which can be expressed as B = Y - 7.

Furthermore, we know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, which can be expressed as R + B + Y = 37.

We can use the first two equations to express R and B in terms of Y. Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the amount of money Ronnie was given as 'R' and the amount of money Rissa was given as '3R', since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie.

We are given that after each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. Let's call the amount given to the little sister 'x'. Therefore, Rissa's remaining money can be expressed as 3R - x, and this is equal to 4/5 of her original money, which is 4/5 * 3R.

We can set up the equation: 3R - x = (4/5) * 3R.

Simplifying the equation, we get:
3R - x = 12R/5
Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:
15R - 5x = 12R
Subtracting 12R from both sides:
3R - 5x = 0
Adding 5x to both sides:
3R = 5x
Dividing both sides by 5:
R = (5/3)x

Now, we know that Ronnie's remaining money is R - x, which is equal to (5/3)x - x. We can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator:
(5/3)x - x = (5/3)x - (3/3)x = (2/3)x

However, we also know that Ronnie was originally given $5. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
(2/3)x = 5 - x
Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
2x = 15 - 3x
Adding 3x to both sides:
5x = 15
Dividing both sides by 5:
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find Ronnie's remaining money:
Ronnie's remaining money = (2/3)x = (2/3)(3) = 2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we can start by denoting the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of these three colors, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3x.

We are given that half the mural is yellow, so the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, half of it is yellow, and the other half is 6 pints. This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total area of the house, we must first calculate the area of each component and then sum them together.

The area of a single bedroom is calculated as the product of its length and width, which is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is stated to be 5 times larger than a single bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we sum the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3160}$"
"To determine the total number of clouds Alice counted over the five-day period, we can use a geometric progression to model the situation. The number of clouds on each day forms a sequence where each term is double the previous term, starting with 3 clouds on Monday.

The sequence of clouds is as follows:
- Day 1 (Monday): 3 clouds
- Day 2 (Tuesday): 3 * 2 = 6 clouds
- Day 3 (Wednesday): 6 * 2 = 12 clouds
- Day 4 (Thursday): 12 * 2 = 24 clouds
- Day 5 (Friday): 24 * 2 = 48 clouds

To find the total number of clouds, we can sum the terms of the sequence. This can be done using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: S = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 3, r = 2, and n = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
S = 3 * (2^5 - 1) / (2 - 1)
S = 3 * (32 - 1) / 1
S = 3 * 31
S = 93

The final answer is: 93"
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $1, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can find this by adding 20% of 100 to 100.

20% of 100 is calculated as 0.2 * 100 = 20. Therefore, the new box contains 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we can find the number of cycles that can be run with the new box for $12. Since each cycle requires one pod, the number of cycles is equal to the number of pods in the new box, which is 120.

To find the number of cycles that can be run for $1, we divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box for $1 is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps.

First, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

Then, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

After that, he triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

The final numerical answer is: $300"
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Since team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate the remaining length of the chalk after Monday and then find out how many days it will last at a rate of 20% usage per day.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we first need to establish the number of face masks Mike purchased. It is given that Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we calculate three times the amount Mike bought, which is 3 * 5 = 15 face masks.

Since Johnny bought 2 more face masks than this amount, we add 2 to 15, resulting in 15 + 2 = 17 face masks.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final answer is: 17"
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist treats. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth the dentist caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth he drills and caps, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, and then multiply by 100. This gives us (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned to the company, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total gallons of milk he initially purchased.

The total gallons of milk purchased is 4000. To find 2/5 of this amount, we can multiply 4000 by 2 and then divide the result by 5.

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons of milk were returned.

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.

Refund = 1600 * 3.5 = 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information. Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

Therefore, Colin's current age is 20 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of books Bob can purchase, we first need to calculate the total number of sets of 100 books he can buy with his $27,000. This can be done by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of 100 books.

Total sets of 100 books = $27,000 / $500
Total sets of 100 books = 54

Since each set contains 100 books, the total number of books Bob can buy is 54 * 100 = 5400 books.

To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools.

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 5400 / 3
Books per school = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of events and track the number of apples Newton has at each step.

Initially, two apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up these two apples, so he now has 2 apples.

He then put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This means he now has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples, for a total of 6 apples.

Next, he put all but one of the new apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple outside. He still has the 1 apple in his pocket, so his total is now 6 apples.

Finally, he threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. He now has the 6 apples from the previous step and the 6 new apples, for a total of 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we first need to calculate the number of 50 kg bags he ordered. This can be done by dividing the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight per bag (50 kg).

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Next, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost.

Cost per bag = $18
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will consume. 

For the cheese pizza, each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices, resulting in a total of 6 * 6 = 36 slices consumed. Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

Similarly, for the pepperoni pizza, each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices, resulting in a total of 6 * 4 = 24 slices consumed. Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Therefore, Kate needs to purchase a total of 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles he ran on each day and then sum them up.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This is a total of 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, he ran 5 miles each day, which amounts to 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

Therefore, the total miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles.

"To determine the time it takes for Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs, we need to consider the rates at which he builds and loses snowballs.

Jay constructs 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, which implies a rate of 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. Conversely, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, resulting in a melting rate of 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate of snowball accumulation, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: (1/3) - (2/15). To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator, which is 15. Therefore, we rewrite 1/3 as (5/15) and perform the subtraction: (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time required to accumulate 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. This is given by the formula: Time = Number of snowballs / Rate = 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to accumulate 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To find Jim's current age, we need to first determine Jim's age 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now and was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to solve for Jim's age 20 years ago.

Let x be Jim's age 20 years ago. Then, John's age 20 years ago was 2x. Since John is 28 now, we can write the equation:

2x + 20 = 28

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation gives us:

2x = 8

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us:

x = 4

This means Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago:

4 + 20 = 24

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of slices each person ate. 

Let's start by identifying the information given: Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, which means her sister ate 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate 3 slices.

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices each person ate: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach to track the number of bandages used and ordered by the nurses over the three days.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. Therefore, the number of bandages they had at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, the number of bandages they had at the end of the second day is (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They also used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. Therefore, the number of bandages they had at the end of the third day is ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:

"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the difference in the length of her hair and multiply it by the cost per inch, then add the cost of the color.

The initial length of May's hair was 10 inches, and the final length was 8 inches. Therefore, the difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

Given that the cost per inch of the haircut is $30, the cost for 2 inches is 2 * $30 = $60.

Adding the cost of the color, which is $40, to the cost of the haircut, we get a total cost of $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her regular pay and attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April. Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

The final answer is: $510"

"To determine the total cost of John's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles, so the cost per bottle is $600 / 10 = $60.

The number of bottles of cognac is twice the number of bottles of scotch, which is 2 * 10 = 20 bottles.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees separately and then add them together.

Let's start by identifying the number of trees planted on the first day. Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day is 2 * 20 = 40.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, resulting in a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. Additionally, he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. Therefore, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days:
White Oak: 30
Lodgepole Pine: 90

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is the sum of the White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 30 + 90 = 120.

"To find the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as x.

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be expressed as 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. We can start by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we can calculate one-third of the total number of fish in the tank.

One-third of 66 = 66 / 3 = 22

Next, we need to determine the number of fish that do not have red stripes. This can be found by subtracting the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

Total fish = 66
Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish without red stripes = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish to determine the number of fish with blue stripes.

5/11 of 44 = (5/11) * 44 = 20

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish with blue stripes = 20
Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

"To determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had and then subtract the ones she lost or used up.

Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so the total number of eyeshadow colors from the palettes is 2 * 4 = 8.

She also had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each, so the total number of eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets is 3 * 6 = 18.

Therefore, Amy initially had a total of 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which contained 4 eyeshadow colors. As a result, Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors, leaving her with 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Next, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 eyeshadow colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the given information.

First, we know that Mattison's height is 60 inches. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, which gives us a total height of 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Next, we are told that the floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the two-story house is 420 inches, and the first floor's height is 180 inches, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the first floor's height from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house: 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

"To determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we first need to calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas. This can be done by finding 40% of the total number of shells discovered, which is 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas has found their share. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of shells found by Alphas from the total number of shells.

Remaining shells = 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we subtract the total number of shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

Shells found by Gogetters = 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. Given that she sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for, we can express this as a multiplier of the cost price.

The cost price of the magazines is $72. To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:

Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

"To determine the number of red jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the total volume of the jar. Given that the jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, we can find the volume by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Next, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean, which is 0.15 cubic inches.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Given that 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are told that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to determine the number of red jelly beans he guessed. Since we are not given this information, we will assume that he guessed the number of red jelly beans to be 864.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop and then determine the remaining capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 60. 

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This is equivalent to 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, resulting in a total of 2 * 90 = 180 people.

Now, we need to find the remaining capacity of the bus. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, and there are 180 people on the bus. Therefore, the remaining capacity is 200 - 180 = 20.

"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for two distinct periods: the initial 5 years and the subsequent 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of a single visit is $2. Given that Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual expenditure is 3 * $2 = $6. Consequently, the total cost for the initial 5 years is 5 * $6 = $30.

Following the initial 5-year period, the cost of a single visit increases by 150%. This implies that the new cost of a visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. With Pauline visiting the museum 3 times a year, the annual expenditure becomes 3 * $5 = $15. For the subsequent 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

Therefore, the total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To determine the total amount Ali owes John, we need to calculate the cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately, then sum these costs.

The cost of the tables is 4 units * $20 per unit = $80. This is because the cost of each table is a fixed value, and we are multiplying this value by the number of tables manufactured.

Similarly, the cost of the roof frames is 2 units * $10 per unit = $20. Here, we are applying the same principle of multiplying the cost per unit by the number of units.

To find the total amount owed, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames: $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, Ali owes John a total of $100."
"To find the length of the longer piece, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we must first calculate the total pounds of ground beef required to make 80 meatballs. Given that he obtains 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the total pounds of meat needed by dividing the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can calculate the total seasoning needed by multiplying the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x. Since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies can be expressed as 3x - 2.

We know that each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation:

x + 3x - 2 = 10
Combine like terms: 4x - 2 = 10
Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12
Divide both sides by 4: x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To determine the total cost of the services, we first need to calculate the discount on the manicure and pedicure. The discount on the manicure is 20% of $35, which is 0.2 * 35 = $7. Similarly, the discount on the pedicure is 20% of $40, which is 0.2 * 40 = $8.

The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15. This discount is applied to the combined cost of the manicure and pedicure, which is $35 + $40 = $75. Therefore, the cost of the manicure and pedicure after the discount is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

First, we calculate the price increase in December. An 80% increase from the initial price of $40 is given by 80% of $40, which is 0.8 * $40 = $32. Therefore, the new price in December is $40 + $32 = $72.

Next, we calculate the price decrease in January. A 50% decrease from the price in December is given by 50% of $72, which is 0.5 * $72 = $36. Therefore, the new price in January is $72 - $36 = $36.

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the revenue from both the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the standard rate lessons. Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour, so the total revenue from these lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the revenue from the reduced rate lessons. Since Charlie reduces his rate by 25% for veteran clients, the reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate. This can be calculated as $80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour. Charlie has 2 lessons at this reduced rate, so the total revenue from these lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we can find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day by adding the revenue from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons: $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to calculate the average of the given scores. This can be done by summing up all the scores and then dividing by the total number of scores.

The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

First, let's add up the scores:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630. There are 9 scores in total.

Now, let's calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the total number of scores:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find the number of pomelos Eve gave away, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let x be the number of pomelos Eve gave away. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can express this as:

20 - x = (1/4) * 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 - x = 5

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

-x = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1 to isolate x:

x = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of apples Walter ate. This can be calculated by finding 2/5 of the total number of apples he bought, which is 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

Next, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

The amount of money he received = 27 * 3 = 81

Therefore, Walter received $81 from selling the remaining apples.

The final answer is: $81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we can set up a proportion based on the information given. If 9 novels represent 3 quarters of the total, we can let x be the total number of novels written this year.

We can then set up the equation: 9 = (3/4)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3 to isolate x.

(4/3) * 9 = x
x = 12

Therefore, Regina wrote 12 novels this year."
"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we first need to calculate the total distance he traveled in 3 days. Given that there are 24 hours in a day, the total hours traveled is 3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance covered by multiplying the average speed by the total hours traveled: 50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km.

To find the percentage of the distance covered, we divide the distance covered by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, and then multiply by 100: (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 0.6 * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, the percentage of the distance covered by Michael is 60%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the initial number of grapes, we can start by identifying the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother. Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Next, we know that their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie requires 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

However, we are given that the mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, which means that the total number of grapes used by all three is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline and her brother (36) and the grapes used by their mother (48). This gives us a total of 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Since the total number of grapes used is 84, and we know that the mother used all the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, we can conclude that the initial number of grapes is 84.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School on that day, we need to consider the number of teachers who were not absent and the number of substitute teachers called in to help.

First, we calculate the number of teachers who were not absent by subtracting the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers at the school.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13

Number of teachers not sick = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers
= 82 - 13
= 69

Next, we add the number of substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were not sick to find the total number of teachers at school that day.

Number of substitute teachers = 9

Total number of teachers at school = Number of teachers not sick + Number of substitute teachers
= 69 + 9
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in a year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. 
The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.
The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total weekly cost of the macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To determine the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time available for cleaning and the total time required to clean all the classrooms.

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task, and they work 8 hours a day. Therefore, the total time available for cleaning is 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

Next, we calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiplying by 100: (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first calculate the capacity of each shelf. The middle shelves can hold 10 books each, while the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, resulting in a capacity of 15 books.

The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of its shelves: 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we can calculate the number of bookcases needed by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2.

Therefore, Elly requires 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate Rose's profit, we first need to determine the total cost of the eggs and the total revenue from selling them.

The cost of the eggs can be found by multiplying the number of dozens by the cost per dozen. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen, the total cost is:

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Rose bought a total of 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

To find the total revenue, we need to determine how many sets of 3 eggs Rose can sell. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of eggs by 3:

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since she sells each set for $1, the total revenue will be:

20 sets * $1/set = $20

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the number of white hats, we first need to calculate the number of red and blue hats.

The fraction of red hats is 1/2, so the number of red hats is 100 * (1/2) = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

The fraction of blue hats is 3/5, so the number of blue hats is 50 * (3/5) = 30.

The number of white hats can be found by subtracting the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats: 100 - 50 - 30 = 20.

"To determine the cost of each stick of beef jerky, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the bag. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it is discounted by $3.00. 

Discounted price = Original price - Discount
Discounted price = $18.00 - $3.00
Discounted price = $15.00

To convert the discounted price to cents, we multiply it by 100:
Discounted price (in cents) = $15.00 * 100
Discounted price (in cents) = 1500 cents

Now, we can find the cost of each stick of jerky by dividing the discounted price in cents by the number of sticks per bag:
Number of sticks per bag = 30
Cost per stick = Discounted price (in cents) / Number of sticks per bag
Cost per stick = 1500 / 30
Cost per stick = 50 cents

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she must answer correctly to pass. 

The total number of questions is the sum of the questions on both tests, which is 70 + 40 = 110.

Since Audrey must correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade, we can calculate this as 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we need to find out how many questions she got right on the first test. This is given as 60% of 70 questions, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she must answer correctly: 77 - 42 = 35.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B.

We know that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write this relationship as B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which means the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116. This can be expressed as S + B = 116.

Now, we can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combining like terms, we get 6S - 4 = 116.

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get 6S = 120.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find that S = 20.

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting S into the expression for B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's consider the flashlights. There are 4 people in the household, and each person has a flashlight. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, we'll calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since half of 8 is 4, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

"To determine the number of calls Tim deals with in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate the number of calls he handles in a single day. Given that he spends 6 hours at work and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, we must convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is equivalent to 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can calculate the number of calls he handles in a day by dividing the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

To find the total number of calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5: 24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we need to establish the cost of each additional phone. Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

Given that the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation 2x = 20. To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can calculate the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4x = 4 * 10 = 40.

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

"To determine the time it takes for John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he has increased it by a factor of 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Next, we calculate the total number of words in 10 pages, assuming each page has 450 words.

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

Now, we can find the time it takes to speak 4500 words at the new speed.

Time = Total words / New speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM

To convert this to a more meaningful unit, we can express the time in hours.

Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 hours

"To determine the total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

The final answer is: 210"
"To determine the total number of lemons required, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade to be made. Since Tim wants to make 4 gallons for the party and an additional gallon for Allen, the total amount of lemonade is 5 gallons.

Each gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice. Therefore, the total amount of lemon juice needed is 5 cups.

The extra tart lemonade requires twice the amount of lemon juice as the regular lemonade, which means it requires 2 cups of lemon juice. This leaves 5 - 2 = 3 cups of lemon juice for the regular lemonade.

Now, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for each type of lemonade. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the number of lemons needed for the regular lemonade is 3 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 18 lemons. For the extra tart lemonade, the number of lemons needed is 2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons.

The total number of lemons required is the sum of the lemons needed for the regular and extra tart lemonade, which is 18 + 12 = 30 lemons.

"To determine the total amount of dog food required for the kennel in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then multiply it by 7.

The daily consumption of German Shepherds can be calculated as follows: 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day. Similarly, the daily consumption of Bulldogs is 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day. 

Adding these values together, we get the total daily consumption: 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

Therefore, the kennel will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first need to calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged and 4-legged animals.

The farm has 10 2-legged animals, each contributing 2 legs, resulting in a total of 10 * 2 = 20 legs. Similarly, the 15 4-legged animals contribute 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Adding these together, we get a total of 20 + 60 = 80 legs. Since each pair consists of 2 legs, we can find the total number of pairs by dividing the total number of legs by 2.

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 80 / 2 = 40.

"To determine the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%, which is 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. Therefore, the value after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30%, which is 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. Therefore, the value after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%, which is 0.2 * $4410 = $882. Therefore, the value after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we need to first establish the quantities of the other colored candies. 

Given that there are 54 red candies, we know that the number of orange candies is twice this amount, which is 2 * 54 = 108.

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so it is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we can calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag: 232 - 189 = 43.

Therefore, the number of pink candies in the bag is 43."
"To determine the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the bus trips separately and then sum them up.

The cost of the hotel can be found by multiplying the cost of one night by the number of nights. Given that one night at the hotel costs $80, the total cost of the hotel is $80 * 3 = $240.

Next, we need to find the cost of one bus trip. Since each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, we can calculate it as 0.1 * $80 = $8. With 7 bus trips, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

Therefore, the total cost of Helen's trip is the sum of the hotel and bus costs, which is $240 + $56 = $296.

"To determine the force required to move the car, we need to calculate 1% of the total weight of the car, its luggage, and the two children.

First, we calculate the total weight by adding the individual weights together:

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Next, we find 1% of the total weight, which is equivalent to 0.01 times the total weight.

Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force required to move the car is 16 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many days it takes Nate to fill them in. 

First, let's find the total number of holes dug by the dog. Since the dog digs 6 holes per day and Nate is on vacation for 14 days, we can multiply these two numbers together.

Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

However, the dog continues to dig 6 new holes every night, so we need to account for these additional holes. Since Nate is home for the same number of days he was on vacation, the dog digs 6 new holes per night for 14 nights.

Additional holes dug = 6 holes/night * 14 nights = 84 holes

Now, we add the initial holes dug to the additional holes dug to get the total number of holes.

Total holes = 84 holes + 84 holes = 168 holes

Next, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, so the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 holes / 3 holes/day = 56 days

Finally, we need to convert the total days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total days by 7.

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 days / 7 days/week = 8 weeks

The final answer is: 2325"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested. However, this statement is incorrect as it contradicts the first statement. Instead, we can infer that Igor gathered 2 fewer test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 - 2 = 12 Petri dishes.
- Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 12 Petri dishes = 27 items.

Since Igor had 29 items on the lab bench, he must have lost 29 - 27 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and then subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the total number of screws needed for each table is 4 legs * 2 screws/leg = 8 screws/table.

Since James is assembling 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

Given that James has 40 screws, the number of screws he will have left over can be calculated as follows: 40 screws (initial amount) - 32 screws (required) = 8 screws.

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to establish the number of eggs in the second basket. Since it contains twice as many eggs as the first basket, and the first basket has 10 eggs, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket by multiplying the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

The number of eggs in the second basket is 2 * 10 = 20.

Now, to find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to calculate the individual contributions and then sum them up.

Let's start by identifying the amount raised by each girl. Alexandra raises $430. Since Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, we can calculate Kim's contribution as $430 + $320 = $750.

Similarly, Sarah raises $300, and Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. Therefore, Maryam's contribution is $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we can find the total amount raised by adding the individual contributions: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"To solve this problem, we can establish a relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances. Let's denote Aaron's speed as A and Vanessa's speed as V. We are given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so we can express this as A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. Since distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, we can express this as 2A = Vt, where t is the time it takes for Vanessa to run her part of the race.

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance of Vanessa (4 miles / 2 = 2 miles), we can set up the equation:

A * 2 = 16

Since A = 2V, we can substitute this into the equation:

2(2V) * 2 = 16

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4V * 2 = 16

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

V * 2 = 4

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

V = 2

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it takes her to run 4 miles:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 / 2

Time = 2 * 2

Time = 4

However, this is the time it takes for Vanessa to run 2 miles. Since we want to find the time it takes for her to run 4 miles, we can multiply this by 2:

Time = 4 * 2

Time = 8

Therefore, Vanessa took 8 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to purchase, we must first calculate the required line for the existing 200 feet of dock. Given that he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we can find this by multiplying the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already possesses 6 feet of new line. To find the total amount he needs to buy, we subtract the existing line from the required line:

600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs to purchase 594 feet of line in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{594}$"
"To determine the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we first need to calculate their daily revenue. Given that they receive 6 reservations per night and each reservation consists of 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine, we can calculate the daily revenue as follows:

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5) + $5 (bottle of wine) = (2 * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we can find the weekly revenue by multiplying the daily revenue by the number of days they are open:

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * Number of days open = $15 * 2 = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to determine the total revenue generated from selling all 50 watermelons. Given that the vendor sold them at a 25% profit, the selling price is 125% of the cost price.

Let's denote the cost price of one watermelon as 'x'. The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80, so we can write the equation as 50x = 80. Solving for 'x', we get x = 80 / 50 = $1.60.

Now, we can find the selling price of one watermelon. The selling price is 125% of the cost price, which is 1.25x. Substituting the value of 'x', we get the selling price as 1.25 * 1.60 = $2.

Therefore, the selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current age of James and then find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years.

First, we know that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, his current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We are also given that John had James when he was 19. This implies that the time that has passed since then is 18 - 19 = -1 year. However, this is a logical contradiction, as age cannot be negative. This suggests that the initial information provided is inconsistent.

However, we can still proceed with the problem by ignoring the inconsistency. We are also given that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Therefore, his youngest son's current age is 32.

To find his age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 32 + 3 = 35.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of oranges Ana and Jane can peel in an hour, we first need to calculate their individual peeling rates. 

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her peeling rate is 1 orange per 3 minutes. In 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her peeling rate is 1 orange per 4 minutes. In 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total cost Mark incurred for the new radiator and the mechanic's labor, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the radiator. The original price of the radiator is $400, and Mark obtained an 80% discount. 

The discount amount is 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * 400 = $320. Therefore, the discounted price of the radiator is 400 - 320 = $80.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic worked for 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour, so the labor cost is 3 * 50 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost, which is 80 + 150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation 2C + 4W = 70.

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the second equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

Therefore, the number of chickens on the farm is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
