"As a health expert, I'd like to analyze Janet's daily egg-related activities. 

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. To determine her daily earnings, we need to calculate the number of eggs she has left for sale.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs used: 3 (breakfast) + 4 (baking) = 7 eggs.

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 

To find her daily earnings, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the selling price: 9 * 2 = $18.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for a robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber needed. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since the amount of white fiber is half that of blue fiber, we calculate it as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts required:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"The art of flipping a house can be a lucrative venture, but it requires a solid understanding of the numbers. Let's dive into Josh's situation. He purchases a house for $80,000 and then invests $50,000 in repairs. This significant investment increases the value of the house by a substantial 150%.

To calculate the new value of the house, we need to consider the original value and the percentage increase. The original value is $80,000, and a 150% increase means the new value is 2.5 times the original value (100% + 150% = 250%, or 2.5 times the original).

New value = Original value * 2.5
New value = $80,000 * 2.5
New value = $200,000

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = Original price + Repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"When it comes to physical activity, consistency and frequency are key. James has a great routine of running 3 sprints 3 times a week. Each sprint is 60 meters, which is a great distance for improving cardiovascular endurance and building speed.

To calculate the total distance James covers in a week, we need to consider the number of sprints he runs in a session and the number of sessions he has in a week. Since he runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total distance covered in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Now, let's calculate the total distance covered in a week:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

This is a great way to stay active and improve cardiovascular health. Regular sprinting can also help increase speed, agility, and overall fitness.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we must first consider the total daily nutritional requirements of her flock. A balanced diet for chickens typically consists of a combination of seeds, mealworms, and vegetables.

Given that Wendi's flock consists of 20 chickens, and each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per meal, the total daily feed requirement per meal is 3 cups * 20 chickens = 60 cups.

Since Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, the total feed given in these two meals is 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

To ensure her chickens receive a balanced diet, Wendi should provide the remaining feed in the final meal of the day. Therefore, the amount of feed needed in the final meal is 60 cups (total daily requirement) - 40 cups (morning and afternoon feed) = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"

"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to establish the number of sheep in each city. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, which means Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To determine the total time it takes to download the file, we need to consider the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, we can find the time it takes to download 80 GB (40% of 200 GB) as follows:
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Next, we need to account for the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes.

Now, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

However, since Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, we need to add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file again. This means we add the time it takes to download 80 GB (40 minutes) to the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file (60 minutes) and the time it takes to install the updates (20 minutes).

Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each segment of his trip and then subtract the total distance from the initial distance.

First, let's calculate the distance John traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Next, we need to calculate the distance John traveled in the return trip. He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so the distance traveled in this segment is 0 miles.

Then, he drove for half an hour at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

After that, he drove for the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 160 = 175 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance John traveled:
Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles
Total distance traveled = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

However, since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider her regular hourly rate and overtime pay rate. Her regular hourly rate is $10, and her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $12 per hour.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 * $10 = $400. 

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find the reduction, we calculate 30% of 180, which is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"When it comes to indulging in sweet treats, it's essential to be mindful of the total cost. Let's break down the expenses for Toula's pastry shopping trip.

First, we have the donuts. Three dozen donuts at $68 per dozen will amount to 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, we have the mini cupcakes. Two dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen will cost 2 * $80 = $160.

Lastly, we have the mini cheesecakes. Six dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen will come out to 6 * $55 = $330.

To find the total cost, we simply add these amounts together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"To determine when Carlos will start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to consider the initial cost of the tree and the annual revenue and expenses.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. Each year, the tree generates revenue from 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, totaling $10.5 per year. However, it also incurs an annual expense of $3 for watering and feeding.

To find the net revenue each year, we subtract the annual expense from the revenue: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take for the tree to pay for itself. We divide the initial cost by the net revenue: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

However, this calculation indicates when the tree will break even, not when it starts earning money. Since the tree generates revenue in the first year, it will start earning money in the first year.

Therefore, it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself, but it will start generating a profit in the first year.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with a certain number of vacuum cleaners, which we'll call ""x"".

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

2. After selling at the green house, she had (x - x/3) = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

4. After selling at the red house, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2x/3 - 2) is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = (x/3 - 1).

5. So, she had (2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1)) = (x/3 - 1) vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.

6. We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

7. To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

8. Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Next, let's find the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of the remaining 16 students is 4 students.

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students to find the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

Therefore, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

"To determine the best investment option for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each item.

The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, and the electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%. 

Let's calculate the increase in value for each item:
- Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
- Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Based on these calculations, the merchant should choose the jewelry, as it has a higher potential increase in value.

The profit from this investment would be $125."
"To determine the distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to consider the combined distances traveled in both directions. 

The trains travel 80 miles westward on the first day and 150 miles northward on the second day. Since these distances are perpendicular to each other, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance covered by each train.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Let's apply this theorem to find the total distance covered by each train:

Total distance = √(80^2 + 150^2)
Total distance = √(6400 + 22500)
Total distance = √28900
Total distance = 170 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to consider her earnings from teaching and coaching separately.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked per year would be 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year. Therefore, her annual earnings from teaching would be 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked per year would be 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year. Therefore, her annual earnings from coaching would be 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500.

To find Jill's total annual salary, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we need to consider her daily egg intake and the total number of days in that time frame.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will consist of 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, which translates to 3 eggs per day. Over the course of 28 days, her total egg consumption will be 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

To convert this to dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

Therefore, Claire will consume 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the hike. Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike, we can find the total time by dividing the total distance by her desired average speed.

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, so she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the final mixture, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so we need to find two-thirds of 10 liters. 
Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so we need to find three-fifths of 15 liters.
Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling. 
The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water.
The remaining amount of water is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. 
Since the total amount of the mixture is 24 liters, and we have 14.67 liters of water, the remaining amount of non-water liquid is 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. 
Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to calculate the age difference between Raymond and his son.

Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, and we know that Samantha is 31 years old, we can calculate Raymond's current age by subtracting 6 years from Samantha's age. This gives us 31 - 6 = 25 years.

Now, we can find the age difference between Raymond and his son by subtracting the age at which he had a son (23) from his current age (25). This gives us 25 - 23 = 2 years.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

Next, we'll calculate the number of DVDs sold to the next 2 customers. Since each of them bought 2 DVDs, the total number of DVDs sold to this group is 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, we can find the total number of DVDs sold by adding the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers. This gives us 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"When analyzing the burning of a candle, it's essential to consider the rate at which it melts. In this case, the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters every hour.

To determine the total melting, we need to calculate the total time the candle burns. The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total melting:

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the discounted price is 75% of the original price, since a 25% discount means 75% of the original price remains.

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. The discounted price is 75% of the original price, which is 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased, excluding the pizza boxes. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15, and the cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

Adding these costs together, we get $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Now, we subtract this total from the amount Marie paid, which is $50. This gives us $50 - $33 = $17. 

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the remaining cost by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on clothing items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the pants: 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.

Lastly, we'll find the cost of the shoes: 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each is 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The total amount Mishka spent on clothing items is $243."
"As a health expert, I'd like to emphasize the importance of mindful snacking habits, especially when it comes to high-calorie treats like ice cream. However, I'll focus on calculating the cost of Cynthia's ice cream consumption.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the number of cartons she'll need for 60 days. Since each carton contains 15 servings and she eats one serving per night, we can find the total number of cartons required by dividing 60 by 15.

60 / 15 = 4

This means Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream. Given that each carton costs $4.00, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton.

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream over the 60-day period.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to understand the layout of his bike trip. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

The distance from the first stop to the second stop is 15 miles.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the cost of the boots, let's analyze the given information. We know that one pair of high heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is $66. The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

We are also told that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. This can be represented as: Boots = Heels1 + Heels2 + 5.

Substituting the values, we get: Boots = 33 + 66 + 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get: Boots = 104.

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $104.

The final answer is: $104"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages. Let's assume their ages are represented by the variables 7x and 11x, where x is a constant.

Given that their combined age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms, we get: 18x = 162

Dividing both sides by 18, we find: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can determine Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."

"When it comes to caring for multiple pets, it's essential to consider the time commitment required to ensure their well-being. In this case, John is responsible for 10 dogs, each requiring 0.5 hours of attention per day.

To calculate the total time spent caring for the dogs daily, we multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog.

Number of dogs: 10
Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Total time per day = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Total time per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the total time per day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7
Total time per week = 35 hours

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week caring for his 10 dogs.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we need to establish a relationship between the number of gold and silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so we can express this as G = S + 30.

We also know that the total number of coins is 110, which means the sum of silver and gold coins is 110. This can be expressed as S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 30 = 110.

Next, we subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with S, resulting in 2S = 80. To solve for S, we divide both sides by 2, which gives us S = 40.

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30. This gives us G = 40 + 30 = 70.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the number of jewels Siobhan has, we need to break down the information provided.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. 

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels: 40 / 2 = 20. Then, we add 5 to this number to find Aaron's total: 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total: 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the total points Mike scored in the ping pong game, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which equals 1 point. Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total cost of yogurt for Terry over 30 days, we need to calculate the number of yogurts he consumes and the total number of sets he purchases.

Terry eats 2 yogurts per day. Over 30 days, he would consume 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since the yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Each set costs $5.00, so Terry spends 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 * 15 = 195 dollars

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

He also has $5 left, so the total amount of money he spent is:
195 - 5 = 190 dollars

Now, we subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount of money he made:
195 - 160 = 35 dollars

This means John spent $35 of his own money to buy the video games. Since he spent $35 of his own money, he must have used the remaining money from the Lego sales to buy the video games. 

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $35. 
35 / 15 = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 11 sets with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours on the first day. For the other two days, he runs half as much, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time.
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

**The final answer is: 3.33**"
"To determine Dana's total distance traveled, we need to calculate the distance she covers while walking and running. 

First, let's find her walking speed. Since her skipping speed is half of her running speed, and she skips at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. 

Given that her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can calculate her walking speed as 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's determine the time she spends walking and running. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, the time she spends walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours, and the time she spends running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to understand the relationships between the ages of the iPhones of Brandon, Ben, and Suzy.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, we are given that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while still hitting it with the gold javelin, we need to consider the increased range provided by the sapphire gemstone.

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than her original range. 

Original range = 400 feet
Range with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the flames and still hit the dragon with the javelin.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pie pieces taken by the guests, we need to calculate the total number of pieces initially available and then subtract the remaining pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces: 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

Next, we subtract the remaining pieces: 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces.

Therefore, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To determine how many grams of chips you can safely consume, we first need to calculate how many calories you have left in your daily target. Your daily calorie goal is 2000, and you've already consumed 1800 calories. 

Subtracting the calories you've already consumed from your daily target gives us: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we can find out how many servings you can still have by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Now, knowing that a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can calculate the total weight of chips you can safely consume by multiplying the number of servings you can still have by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

Therefore, you can safely consume 240 grams of chips."
"To calculate the net profit from selling beeswax candles, we need to consider the cost of supplies and the revenue generated from selling the candles.

First, let's determine the cost of supplies. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles. Since he wants to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost of supplies is $20.00.

Next, we need to calculate the revenue generated from selling the candles. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he wants to sell 20 candles. Therefore, the total revenue is $40.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"As a health expert, I'd be happy to help calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles. 

To determine the total time spent writing, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article, which is 4 hours.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Total number of articles written in 3 days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we need to consider the total number of Post-it notes she had at the end and work our way backward.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 at work and had 23 remaining. To find the total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package, we add the initial and remaining Post-it notes and subtract the ones used:

Total Post-it notes after purchasing the package = 80 (initial) + 23 (remaining) - 220 (used)
Total Post-it notes after purchasing the package = 103 - 220
Total Post-it notes after purchasing the package = -117 (this is incorrect, as we cannot have a negative number of Post-it notes)

However, we know that the total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package is equal to the sum of the initial Post-it notes, the Post-it notes used, and the Post-it notes remaining. Let's re-evaluate the equation:

Total Post-it notes after purchasing the package = 80 (initial) + x (package) - 220 (used) + 23 (remaining)
Total Post-it notes after purchasing the package = x + 23

Since the total Post-it notes after purchasing the package is equal to the sum of the initial Post-it notes, the Post-it notes used, and the Post-it notes remaining, we can set up the equation:

x + 23 = 80 + 220 - 23
x + 23 = 277 - 23
x + 23 = 254
x = 254 - 23
x = 231

The final answer is: 231"
"To determine the total amount spent on ties, we need to calculate the cost of both blue and red ties.

First, let's find the number of blue ties. Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie: 200 / 40 = 5.

Now, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

To find the total cost of red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost per tie: 10 * 60 = $600.

Finally, we add the cost of blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent: 200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained from the wire, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can calculate the total length of the wire in inches by multiplying 4 feet by 12 inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces obtained.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces from the wire."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to calculate the total capacity of the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor: 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.

Now, we need to find the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4: 120 units * 3/4 = 90 units.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total capacity: 120 units - 90 units = 30 units.

"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we need to consider the daily egg production and the selling price per dozen.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To determine the total time Tom spent traveling, we need to calculate the time he spent traveling from 1 to 4 PM and the time he spent traveling back.

The distance from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours. Since Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, the distance is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

The time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour is 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Now, we need to find the time it took to travel back. The distance is the same, 30 miles. Since Tom's ship can travel at 6 mph, the time it took to travel back is 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

The total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

The remaining weight to be removed is 15 pounds (the target weight) - 7.5 pounds (weight of comic books) = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys to be removed can be calculated by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider the pension structure. For the first 20 years, she receives a standard annual pension of $50,000. After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

The value of the pension after 20 years is the standard annual pension multiplied by the number of years, which is $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension, which is 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000/year.

To find her total annual pension after 30 years, we add the standard pension for the first 10 years to the 5% pension for the remaining 10 years: $50,000/year + $50,000/year = $100,000/year.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to consider the pricing structure of the service. 

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can divide the year into two equal periods: the first half and the second half. Each period consists of 6 months.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the service charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find the reduced amount, we calculate 90% of $140, which is 0.9 * $140 = $126.

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

To find the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we add the amounts paid for the first and second halves: $840 + $756 = $1596.

"When it comes to fundraising for a charity, every little bit counts, and it's great to see individuals like Tommy taking initiative. In this case, he's selling brownies and cheesecakes to raise funds.

To calculate the total amount raised, we need to consider the revenue generated from each item. Brownies are sold for $3 per slice, and cheesecakes are sold for $4 per slice.

Let's calculate the total revenue from the brownies: 43 brownies * $3 per brownie = $129.

Next, we'll calculate the total revenue from the cheesecakes: 23 cheesecakes * $4 per cheesecake = $92.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total revenue: $129 + $92 = $221.

The final answer is: $221"
"To calculate the monthly payment for Shiela's cell phone installment, we need to consider the interest charged on the total cost of the cell phones.

The original price of 5 cell phones is $150 each, totaling $750. A 2% interest will be charged on this amount. 

The interest charged for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3. 

The total interest charged for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total cost of the cell phones is $750 + $15 = $765.

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total cost by the number of months, which is 3.

The monthly payment is $765 / 3 = $255.

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

The final answer is: $255"
"To determine the total amount Artie will make from his flower stand, we need to consider the prices of each type of flower and the number of pots sold.

The prices of the flowers are as follows: marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot, and begonias for $2.12 per pot. However, since Artie has no change, he will round these prices to the nearest dollar.

Rounded price of marigolds: $2.74 ≈ $3
Rounded price of petunias: $1.87 ≈ $2
Rounded price of begonias: $2.12 ≈ $2

Now, let's calculate the total amount Artie will make from each type of flower:

Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

To find the total amount, we add the amounts together:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"When analyzing the structure of a sandcastle, it's essential to consider the geometric progression of its levels. In this case, each level has half the square footage of the level below it. Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, we can calculate the square footage of the subsequent levels.

The second level will have half the square footage of the top level, which is 16 / 2 = 8.
The third level will have half the square footage of the second level, which is 8 / 2 = 4.
The fourth level will have half the square footage of the third level, which is 4 / 2 = 2.

To find the average square footage of a level, we need to calculate the total square footage of all levels and divide it by the number of levels. The total square footage is 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The average square footage of a level in this sandcastle is 7.5 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To determine the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in that time frame.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. This is a total of 180 cups.

For the rest of the year, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day. Since there are 365 days in a year, and the puppy eats 1 cup for the first 180 days, the number of days the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food is 365 - 180 = 185 days. Therefore, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can calculate the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year by dividing the total amount of dog food eaten by the number of cups in a bag: 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we need to establish their individual laundry loads. 

First, let's consider Sarah's laundry load, which is given as 400 pounds. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can calculate David's load by dividing Sarah's load by 4. This gives us 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry for David.

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. To find Raymond's load, we divide Sarah's load by 2, which results in 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry for Raymond.

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract David's load from Raymond's load: 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds.

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the better price for buying flowers, we need to compare the cost per flower of each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"When it comes to pet grooming, it's essential to consider the costs involved. In this case, the initial price for the dog grooming is $100. As a new customer, the groomer offers a 30% discount. To calculate the final cost, we need to determine the discount amount and subtract it from the original price.

To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3).

Discount amount = 0.3 * $100
= $30

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the final cost.

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

Therefore, the final cost of the dog grooming is $70."
"To determine the amount of water left, we first need to calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls. Since each girl received 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate this as follows:

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they received a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Next, we need to consider the amount of water taken by the boy, which is 6 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy. 
Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

To find the amount of water left, we subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water. 
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of stickers Charlie has left, we need to consider the changes in his sticker collection over time.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers. He then acquired more stickers through purchases and gifts. 

He bought 21 stickers from a store, increasing his total to 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

Following this, he received 23 stickers for his birthday, bringing his total to 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

However, Charlie also gave away and used some stickers. He gave 9 stickers to his sister, reducing his total to 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Lastly, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, leaving him with 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"To determine the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we need to calculate their individual weights first. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. To find Alex's weight, we calculate 4 times what Grace weighs and then subtract 2 pounds from that result.

4 times what Grace weighs is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

To find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"To determine the total number of thorns, we need to consider the anatomy of a rose bush. Each rose bush has multiple roses, and each rose has thorns. 

A typical rose bush has 25 roses, and each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we need to calculate the total number of thorns on all the roses.

First, we multiply the number of roses per bush by the number of thorns per rose: 25 * 8 = 200

However, this is the total number of thorns for one rose bush. Since Dan has 3 rose bushes, we need to multiply this result by 3 to get the total number of thorns: 200 * 3 = 600

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"To determine the number of games the football team won, we need to consider the relationship between the number of games won and lost. Let's denote the number of games lost as L and the number of games won as W.

We know that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can express this as W = L + 8. Additionally, the total number of games played is 22, which means the sum of games won and lost is 22, or W + L = 22.

We can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7

Now that we know L, we can find W: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to consider the number of years he has been vacationing and the frequency of his vacations.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 11 years. Given that he goes on 4 vacations per year, we can calculate the total number of quilt blocks by multiplying the number of years by the number of vacations per year.

The total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"When analyzing the situation, we need to consider the pattern of the alarm's ringing. The first time it went off, it rang for 4 times. 

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which is 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, which is 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to consider the company's policy of increasing salaries by 10% every year for employees who have stayed in the company for five years.

The initial annual salary is $600. To calculate the salary after five years, we apply the 10% increase for each year.

Year 1: $600 + (10% of $600) = $600 + $60 = $660
Year 2: $660 + (10% of $660) = $660 + $66 = $726
Year 3: $726 + (10% of $726) = $726 + $72.6 = $798.6
Year 4: $798.6 + (10% of $798.6) = $798.6 + $79.86 = $878.46
Year 5: $878.46 + (10% of $878.46) = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next three years. The increase is 10% of the current salary.

Year 6: $966.306 + (10% of $966.306) = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366
Year 7: $1062.9366 + (10% of $1062.9366) = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23
Year 8: $1169.23 + (10% of $1169.23) = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

"To find the number of copies Harald sold, we need to consider the relationship between the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald. It's mentioned that Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. This means Marilyn sold 10H copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To determine the total cost of gift bags for Christina's party, we need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

16 (total guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"When planning a picnic for a group of dinosaurs, it's essential to consider the nutritional needs of both adults and children. In this case, we're dealing with a group of 20 adult dinosaurs and 5 child dinosaurs.

Adult dinosaurs require a substantial amount of food, and in this case, they will eat 10 pounds of potato salad each. To calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults, we multiply the number of adults by the amount each adult will eat: 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Children, on the other hand, will eat half as much as the adults. Since they require 5 pounds of potato salad each, we can calculate the total amount needed for the children by multiplying the number of children by their individual consumption: 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount required for the adults and the children: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

Therefore, to ensure that everyone has enough to eat, Ted the T-Rex should bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

The final answer is: 225"
"To determine the total number of pets the three individuals have, we need to establish the number of pets each person owns. 

Cindy has four pets. 

Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To determine the age of Jackson, we need to analyze the given information. 

First, we know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. This means Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Next, we are told that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, we are informed that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. This implies that Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Considering the ages of the children, we can conclude that Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine Gerald's new time, we first need to find his original time. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can calculate Gerald's original time by adding 2 seconds to Lee's time. 

Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's diet improvement increased his speed by 10%. To find the time saved due to this improvement, we calculate 10% of his original time. 10% of 40 is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.

Now, we subtract the time saved from Gerald's original time to find his new time. Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to consider the relationship between the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2. This gives us 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

The combined number of dogs and cats is then 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

Since the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined total: 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we need to determine the total number of girls and then calculate the number of girls who are part of the girl scout.

First, let's find the total number of girls. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 must be girls. 

3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we multiply 2/3 by the total number of girls.

2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

120 - 80 = 40

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40.

"When it comes to sleep, the amount of rest we get can significantly impact our physical and mental well-being. In this case, we're comparing the sleep patterns of two individuals, Harry and James.

Harry slept for 9 hours last night, which is a good amount of rest for most adults. However, James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. To determine how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of 9 hours.

2/3 of 9 hours is calculated as (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours. This means James slept for 6 hours.

Now, let's compare the sleep duration of Harry and James. The difference between their sleep hours is 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the number of tomatoes used by Freda, we need to consider the volume of the sauce and the volume of the tomatoes before cooking. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be double the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, so we can calculate the number of cans used by dividing the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Given that each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can find the total number of tomatoes by multiplying the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes for her last batch of tomato sauce.

"To determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, let's analyze the given information.

We know that a total of 5 cars took an exit, leaving 25 cars to drive through the traffic jam. Additionally, we are told that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars in the first 15 minutes and the cars in the remaining 15 minutes, which is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we need to consider the initial number of plants she had and the number of new plants she received, as well as the number of plants she will give away.

Mary initially had 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home, which gives her a total of 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

She then received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, bringing her total to 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

However, she has decided to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, which means she will give away a total of 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

Therefore, Mary will have 58 potted plants remaining.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of doorbell rings for each friend and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we multiply the first friend's number by 1/4 and add it to the first friend's number: 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

"To determine the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to consider the rate at which it spreads. Given that the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to cover the city by dividing the total distance by the rate.

The city spans 42 miles from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge. To find the time it takes to cover the entire city, we divide the total distance by the rate at which the fog bank spreads.

42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes = 14 sections

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile section, we can multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The final answer is: 140"

"When it comes to snacking, it's essential to maintain a balanced diet. However, in this scenario, we're focusing on the number of cookies consumed by two individuals, Amir and Cody.

Amir's cookie intake is a crucial starting point. If Amir eats 5 cookies, we need to consider Cody's consumption. Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. To calculate Cody's cookie intake, we multiply Amir's cookies by 3.

Cody's cookies = 5 * 3 = 15 cookies

Now, to determine the total number of cookies they eat together, we simply add the number of cookies each person consumes.

Total cookies = Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies
Total cookies = 5 + 15
Total cookies = 20

Therefore, the total number of cookies they eat together is 20."
"To find the total inner volume of the boxes, we need to calculate the inner dimensions of each box first. 

The length of each box is 5 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

The width of each box is 6 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of each box is 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV and subtract the time spent watching other episodes.

Let's break down the time spent watching TV by episode length:

- 1-hour episodes: 2 hours on Monday and Tuesday, and 2 hours on Friday, totaling 4 hours.
- 30-minute episodes: We need to find the time spent watching these episodes on Wednesday.

On Thursday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode, totaling 1.5 hours.

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. Subtracting the time spent watching 1-hour episodes (4 hours) from the total time gives us the time spent watching 30-minute episodes: 7 - 4 = 3 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is 3 / 0.5 = 6.

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's re-evaluate the time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Wednesday. If we subtract the time spent watching 1-hour episodes from the total time, we are left with 3 hours for 30-minute episodes. Since Frankie watched 30-minute episodes on Wednesday, we need to subtract the time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Thursday (0.5 hours) from the total time spent watching 30-minute episodes (3 hours). This leaves us with 3 - 0.5 = 2.5 hours for 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday is 2.5 / 0.5 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of cookies Henry baked last year, we need to consider the information provided. Let's break down the situation:

Henry initially intended to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than planned. After dropping 5 cookies, he had a total of 110 cookies.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. This year, he baked 2x cookies, but actually ended up with 2x + 15 cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. This can be represented by the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"When it comes to making smart financial decisions, it's essential to consider all the factors involved. In this case, we're looking at the cost of gas and a cashback reward. 

To calculate the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first determine the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback rewards.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the cashback reward per gallon is $0.20. 

Total cost of gas without rewards = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00
Total cashback rewards = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"When it comes to consuming fruit roll-ups, it's essential to consider the nutritional value and portion control. In this scenario, we have two individuals, Marcell and Beatrice, competing to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups.

To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each person consumed and then find the average.

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, resulting in a total of 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups. Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, resulting in a total of 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Now, let's find the average number of roll-ups eaten by adding the total number of roll-ups consumed by each and dividing by 2. The total number of roll-ups eaten is 48 + 42 = 90. To find the average, we divide this total by 2, resulting in 90 / 2 = 45.

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the amount of water the boat took on, we need to calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. It took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, which means the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. To find the rate of water intake per second, we can divide the water intake by the time it took to row 20 feet: 2 liters / 16 seconds = 0.125 liters/second.

Since the boat took 64 seconds to reach the shore, we can multiply the rate of water intake by the total time to find the total water intake: 0.125 liters/second * 64 seconds = 8 liters.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to consider the frequency of use and cleaning. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and the whiteboard is used in each lesson. Since there are 4 teachers, the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

Given that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we can calculate the total number of cleanings by multiplying the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson: 8 * 3 = 24.

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total number of flowers Ryan has in his garden, we need to consider the number of flowers he planted and the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, he would have planted a total of 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find the actual number of flowers in his garden, we need to subtract the number of non-growing flowers from the total number of flowers planted.

Total flowers = 30 - 5 = 25

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of photographs that Jamal's and Brittany's phones can hold, and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

Let's start by determining the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can calculate the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as follows:

Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300 photographs

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50.

Number of ducks in Jamal's photograph = 300 / 50
Number of ducks in Jamal's photograph = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the profit from selling the leftover lumber, we need to consider the original cost and the new selling price after the 50% price increase.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each, and 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each.

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 each = $100.
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 each = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have increased by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price.

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber. The revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 each = $150.
The revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 each = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the amount of sugar Katy used in her coffee, we need to understand the ratio of sugar to water. The given ratio is 7:13, indicating that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. 

The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20. To find the fraction of the mixture that is sugar, we divide the number of parts of sugar by the total number of parts: 7/20.

Now, we can multiply this fraction by the total amount of the mixture (120) to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar: (7/20) * 120 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To determine the total amount John paid for the shoes, we need to consider the cost of the shoes for each child and then multiply it by the number of children.

Each child buys 2 pairs of shoes, and each pair costs $60. So, the total cost for one child is 2 * $60 = $120.

Since John has 3 children, we multiply the cost for one child by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

Therefore, John paid a total of $360 for the shoes."
"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to calculate the total number of vehicles that were already at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30, so the number of vehicles imported on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we need to calculate their salaries after the increase.

First, let's find Adrien's salary four years ago. We are given that his salary was $40000. 

Next, we need to calculate the increase in Adrien's salary. It increased by 40% of his old salary. 40% of $40000 is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. So, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Now, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's salary. 70% of $40000 is 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of her old salary. 40% of $28000 is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. So, Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

The final answer is: $95200"

"When it comes to sleep, consistency is key. Adequate sleep is essential for physical and mental well-being. Let's break down Sadie's sleep schedule for the week.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours, which is a good starting point. However, for the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she had to adjust her sleep schedule due to assignments. This resulted in a reduction of 2 hours of sleep each day, bringing her total to 6 hours per day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), Sadie's sleep schedule increased by 1 hour compared to the previous two days, putting her at 7 hours of sleep per day.

To calculate the total hours of sleep, we need to add up the hours for each day:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

"When it comes to endurance and physical performance, understanding an individual's running speed and time is crucial. In this scenario, we have a person, Rosie, who can run at two different speeds: 10 miles per hour for a certain period and 5 miles per hour for another period.

To calculate the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments. First, let's determine the distance she covers at 10 miles per hour. Assuming she runs at this speed for 3 hours, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Next, we'll calculate the distance she covers at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour:
Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"To determine the number of spoons in the package Julia bought, let's analyze the situation step by step.

Initially, Julia had an unknown number of spoons, which we'll denote as 'x'. When her husband gave her a package of 5 new spoons, the total number of spoons became 'x + 5'. After using 3 spoons for sampling, the total number of spoons left was 'x + 5 - 3', which simplifies to 'x + 2'.

We are told that after this, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 12.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us: x = 10.

So, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to calculate the number of fish sausages first. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, and he bought 38 chicken sausages, we add 6 to 38 to find the number of fish sausages: 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages to find the total: 38 + 44 = 82.

The total number of sausages Dylan bought is 82."
"To determine the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to consider their individual friend counts. 

Lily has 50 friends. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, we can calculate Amy's friend count by adding 20 to Lily's friend count: 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have to find the total: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is 120."
"To determine the total amount of money Dillon will spend at the store, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of each item. The cost of each pepper is given as $15. 

A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item. Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180.

Dillon buys 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers is 20 * $15 = $300.

Dillon buys 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total revenue generated from the patients.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by doctors. With 500 patients seen per day, and each patient being seen for an average of 24 minutes, the total time spent is:

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Now, let's calculate the total revenue generated from the patients. The hospital charges $200 per hour, and each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours. 

500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient * $200/hour = $40000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $40000 - $30000
Profit = $10000

The final answer is: $10000"
"The scenario involves a seasonal workforce of 60 elves hired to play in a department store's Santa village. The first incident occurs when children vomit on the elves, leading to a significant number of them quitting. To determine the number of elves who quit due to this incident, we calculate a third of the total workforce: 60 / 3 = 20 elves.

Following this, we subtract the number of elves who quit from the initial total to find the remaining workforce: 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

The second incident involves 10 elves quitting after being kicked by children. To find the final number of elves left, we subtract these 10 elves from the remaining workforce: 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30.

"To determine the annual cost of car washes for an individual, we need to consider the frequency and cost of each car wash. 

Assuming Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15, we can calculate the monthly cost by multiplying the number of car washes by the cost per wash.

Monthly cost = 4 car washes/month * $15/car wash = $60/month

To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12, as there are 12 months in a year.

Annual cost = $60/month * 12 months/year = $720/year

Therefore, Tom pays $720 per year for car washes."
"To determine the number of video games Bobby has, we first need to calculate the number of video games Brian has after losing some. Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply Brian's remaining video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times Brian's remaining video games is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to calculate the proportion of unicorns residing in the Scottish Highlands and then find the number of female unicorns within that group.

First, we calculate the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the total unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we divide the total number of unicorns by 3.

Total unicorns = 27
Unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = 27 / 3 = 9

Next, we find the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we multiply the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands by 2/3.

Female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = 9 * (2/3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

"To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to consider the cost of the items, the delivery fee, and the tip.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost of the items. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20:
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
- Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we need to add the tip, which is $5.00.

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"To determine the number of worker bees in the hive, we need to establish the relationship between the different types of bees. Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. Additionally, there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, which means the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens equals 700. Therefore, we can write the equation W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Since B = 2Q, we have B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, since W = 2B, we have W = 2(200) = 400.

Therefore, the number of worker bees in the hive is 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"As a health expert, I'd like to emphasize the importance of maintaining a balance between leisure activities and work. However, if we consider the scenario where Jordan dedicates his video game time to work, we can calculate his potential earnings.

Assuming Jordan plays video games for 2 hours daily, and he works at a part-time job earning $10 per hour, we can calculate his weekly earnings by first determining the total hours he would work in a week.

There are 7 days in a week, and if Jordan works 2 hours extra each day, his total weekly work hours would be 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

Now, let's calculate his weekly earnings: 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

Considering this calculation, the correct answer is:

"When it comes to managing household expenses, it's essential to consider the total cost of all items, including any applicable taxes. In this case, we have a list of items with varying prices.

First, let's categorize the items into food and non-food items. Food items include milk and eggs, while non-food items include light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

Food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To calculate the profit made by Kim from his housekeeping business, we need to consider the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has a total of 8 clients, which includes 3 current clients and 5 potential clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths for cleaning.

The total number of bottles of bleach needed per week is 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles. The total number of packs of cloths needed per week is 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs.

The cost of bleach per week is 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32. The cost of cloths per week is 8 packs * $5/pack = $40.

Total expenses per week are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths, which is $32 + $40 = $72.

Given that Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to consider the yield per hectare and the frequency of harvests.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare. Assuming each hectare yields 100 pineapples, and John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is 4000."
"To determine the total number of LEGO blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and add them together.

The first set has 500 pieces. 
The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

Now, we add the number of pieces in each set together: 
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The total number of LEGO blocks Johnny picks up is 2125."
"To determine the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, let's analyze the situation step by step.

First, we know that 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. In the next 6 hours, half of these bees return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees. This means that 15 bees return to the hive.

At this point, we have a total of 30 bees that have left the hive initially, and 15 of them have returned. Therefore, 30 - 15 = 15 bees have not returned yet.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. This means 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.

Now, we have a total of 30 bees that left initially and 60 bees that left in the last 6 hours, making a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees that have left the hive. However, we know that 15 bees had not returned yet from the initial 30 bees that left. So, the number of bees that have not returned yet is 15 (from the initial 30 bees) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. Since there were 75 bees that had not returned yet, all of them return to the hive.

The final answer is: 75"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of admission at the museum is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom purchased 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket.

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can calculate the total amount she gave the cashier by adding the change to the total cost.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To determine the number of Facebook friends James has, we need to establish the number of friends Dorothy has first. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can calculate Dorothy's friends by dividing Charlie's friends by 3.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can calculate James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4, as James has four times as many friends as Dorothy.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the outcome of this race, we need to consider the distances and speeds of both participants. Steve, who lives 3 miles away from the school, can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim, on the other hand, lives 2 miles away from the school and can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute.

First, let's convert the distances to feet, as the speeds are given in feet per minute. Since 1 mile equals 5280 feet, Steve's distance is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet, and Tim's distance is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each participant to reach home.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 15840 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 36 minutes

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 36
Difference in time = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made from her bike inflation service, we need to consider the number of tires inflated and the cost per tire.

First, let's calculate the total number of bicycle tires inflated. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of tricycle tires inflated. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came by to get their tires inflated. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9.

Finally, we'll calculate the total number of unicycle tires inflated. A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came by to get their tire inflated. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

Now, let's add up the total number of tires inflated: 10 (bicycle tires) + 9 (tricycle tires) + 1 (unicycle tire) = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost of inflating all the tires is 20 * 25 cents = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To calculate the total cost of the cookies, we need to consider the number of packs, the number of cookies per pack, and the cost per cookie.

First, we determine the total number of cookies by multiplying the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, we need to find the change he receives. This is done by subtracting the total cost from the $10 bill: $10 - $6 = $4.

Therefore, Carl receives $4 in change.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand the sequence of events and the amount of french fries eaten at each stage. 

1. Dave initially ate 14 french fries. 
2. The seagull then ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 french fries. 
   Now, the total eaten is 14 (by Dave) + 7 (by seagull) = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons then ate 3 fries each, so they ate 9 french fries in total.
   Now, the total eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon then ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. 
   After the pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries were left. The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   We can simplify this to (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   We can solve for x by first adding 1 to both sides: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Then, multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18.
   Finally, add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the total hours a college student spends attending classes in a semester, we need to consider their class schedule. 

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. This results in a total of 3 hours per day for these days. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day. This results in a total of 4 hours per day for these days. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. Therefore, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's consider the length of each item in inches. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 24 inches long (since there are 12 inches in a foot).

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

"To determine the total number of bananas needed for the apes at the zoo, we need to calculate the monthly consumption of each type of ape and then multiply it by 2 to account for a 2-month supply.

Monkeys require 200 bananas per month, while gorillas need 400 bananas per month. Baboons, on the other hand, need 100 bananas per month.

To find the total monthly consumption, we add the bananas needed for each type of ape: 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since we want to know the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we multiply the monthly consumption by 2: 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1400}$"
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake's running distance can be calculated by multiplying the number of times he ran back and forth by the total distance covered in each run. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers in each run is twice the length of the field. Therefore, Blake's total distance is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly's running distance can be broken down into two parts: her initial run back and forth, and her subsequent runs to the 40-yard line and back. Her initial run is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Her subsequent runs to the 40-yard line and back are 2 * 40 = 80 yards each. Since she does this 34 times, her total distance for these runs is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Comparing the distances, Blake ran 3000 yards, while Kelly ran 2920 yards. Therefore, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the total amount Raphael spent on school supplies, we need to calculate the cost of the items he purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the pens. Since he bought 4 pens at $1.5 each, the total cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks. Raphael bought 2 notebooks at $4 each, so the total cost of the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $8.

Lastly, we need to consider the cost of the bond paper, which is $20.

Now, we add the costs together: $6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34.

The total amount Raphael spent on school supplies is $34."
"Let's analyze the situation. Initially, there are 11 tadpoles visible in the pond. Then, 6 more tadpoles emerge from under a lily pad, increasing the total number of visible tadpoles to 11 + 6 = 17. However, 2 of these tadpoles then hide under a rock, making them invisible to Finn. To determine the current number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the 2 that hid: 17 - 2 = 15.

"To determine the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we need to calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday first. 

The initial depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Now, we need to find two thirds of the depth of the water on Tuesday. To do this, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

Therefore, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of fish each of them caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we add these numbers together: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

To find the total number of fish caught by Locsin, we add these numbers together: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. We add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin: 19 + 13 = 32.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20, and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means that the price will be multiplied by 1.20 every two months.

Let's calculate the price after 36 months:

- After 2 months: $20 * 1.20 = $24
- After 4 months: $24 * 1.20 = $28.80
- After 6 months: $28.80 * 1.20 = $34.56
- After 8 months: $34.56 * 1.20 = $41.472
- After 10 months: $41.472 * 1.20 = $49.7664
- After 12 months: $49.7664 * 1.20 = $59.71968
- After 14 months: $59.71968 * 1.20 = $71.663416
- After 16 months: $71.663416 * 1.20 = $85.9886984
- After 18 months: $85.9886984 * 1.20 = $103.18683568

"To solve this problem, let's consider the relationship between Seth and Brooke's ages. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we denote Brooke's current age as B, then Seth's current age can be represented as 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and 2B + 2, respectively. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write an equation to represent this:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by multiplying Brooke's age by 2:

Seth's age = 2B
= 2(8)
= 16

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

The final answer is: 16"

"To determine the total age of the four birds, we need to calculate the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, and Sally Four.

We know that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo. Therefore, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red's age is two times that of Sally Four, which means Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

"When it comes to preparing for a big event like a family reunion barbecue, it's essential to consider the time and effort required for food preparation. In this case, Billy is tasked with peeling and cutting 60 potatoes for his potato salad.

To determine the total time it takes to prepare the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato individually and then multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Peeling a potato takes approximately 1.5 minutes, while cutting a potato takes about 5 seconds, which is equivalent to 5/60 minutes. 

Now, let's calculate the total time required for peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes:

Time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Adding both times together, we get the total time required to prepare the potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy a total of 95 minutes to peel and cut all 60 potatoes for his potato salad.

The final answer is: 95"
"To determine the amount spent on lemons, we need to calculate the total revenue and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

First, let's find the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue per gallon is:
20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

Since they made a profit of $25, their total revenue is:
Total revenue = Profit + Cost
Total revenue = $25 + Cost

The number of gallons they sold can be found by dividing the total revenue by the revenue per gallon:
Number of gallons = Total revenue / $10

However, we don't know the total revenue yet. We can express the number of gallons in terms of the total revenue:
Number of gallons = Total revenue / $10

The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5. The cost of sugar per gallon is $2, so the cost of lemons per gallon is:
Cost of lemons per gallon = $5 - $2 = $3

The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:
Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 * (Total revenue / $10)

Since we are given that the total profit is $25, we can set up the equation:
Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
Total revenue - ($3 * Total revenue / $10 + $2 * Total revenue / $10) = $25

Simplifying the equation:
Total revenue - ($5 * Total revenue / $10) = $25
(10 - 5) * (Total revenue / $10) = $25
5 * (Total revenue / $10) = $25
Total revenue / 2 = $25
Total revenue = $50

Now that we have the total revenue, we can find the number of gallons:
Number of gallons = Total revenue / $10
Number of gallons = $50 / $10
Number of gallons = 5

The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:
Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 * 5
Total cost of lemons = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to find the total number of Chinese participants. Since the total number of participants is 240 and 80 of them are Japanese, we can calculate the number of Chinese participants by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total.

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now that we know there are 160 Chinese participants, and 60 of them are boys, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine Zaid's remaining monthly income, we need to calculate the expenses and donations step by step.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on rent: 1/4 of 6000 is 600.

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel: 1/3 of 6000 is 2000.

Now, we subtract these expenses from the total income: 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400.

Then, we calculate the amount donated to charity: 1/2 of 3400 is 1700.

After the donation, we subtract this amount from the remaining income: 3400 - 1700 = 1700.

Next, we calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife: 200 + 700 = 900.

Finally, we subtract this amount from the remaining income: 1700 - 900 = 800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the total number of crabs the three individuals have, we need to calculate the number of crabs each person possesses.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we add the number of crabs each person has to find the total: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The total number of crabs the three individuals have is 122."
"To determine Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the first week. Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

Next, we'll calculate his earnings for the second week. Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for the first and second weeks together:
$50 + $80 = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To determine the number of votes the loser received in the class representative election, we need to first calculate the number of votes the winner received. 

The winner secured 3/4 of the total votes. Given that the total number of students who voted is 80, we can calculate the winner's votes as follows:

3/4 * 80 = 60 votes

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received can be found by subtracting the winner's votes from the total:

80 - 60 = 20

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the number of red roses Sandra needs, we must first establish the number of white carnations. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and there are 200 pink calla lilies.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x, and we know that 5x = 200. 

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40. 
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

Therefore, to keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.

The final answer is: 160"
"To determine Jean's age, let's analyze the given information. We know that Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. Since Jan is 30 now, two years ago, Jan was 28.

We can express Mark's age two years ago as half of Jan's age two years ago plus 5:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * 28 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 to his age two years ago:
Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:
Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"When it comes to athletic competitions, understanding the dynamics of team performance is crucial. In a 4 by 400 meter relay, each team consists of four members, each running 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track.

Let's analyze the performance of the two teams. The well-rounded team has members who can complete their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds each. This consistency is a testament to their training and preparation.

On the other hand, the less well-rounded team has a more variable performance. Their first runner takes 60 seconds to complete the 400 meter leg. However, each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. This means the second runner takes 57 seconds, the third runner takes 54 seconds, and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds.

To determine the winning margin, we need to calculate the total time for each team. The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{58}$"
"When analyzing the likelihood of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 versus rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the probabilities associated with each event.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is calculated by counting the favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) and dividing by the total number of outcomes. This results in a probability of 50%.

To determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we calculate the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll (3/6 = 1/2) and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll (3/6 = 1/2). Since these events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between these two events.

The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"When it comes to harvesting apples from a farm, it's essential to consider the overall health benefits of consuming a balanced diet rich in fruits. In this scenario, Jenna and her mother are picking apples, which are a nutritious and delicious addition to a healthy diet.

To determine the total number of apples they picked, we need to consider the number of apples Jenna picked in relation to the number of apples her mother picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, we can calculate the number of apples she picked by dividing the number of apples her mother picked by 2.

Given that her mother picked 20 apples, Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we need to first calculate the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits. 

The hamsters are kept in 10 cages, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

The total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

The total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to consider the interest accrued over 3 months. 

The initial amount owed is $100. With a monthly interest rate of 2% or 0.02, we can calculate the interest for each month.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $100 + $2 = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $102 + $2.04 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we add the interest to the initial amount: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to consider the total cost and total revenue. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total cost of the outing and the amount each friend paid, we need to calculate the expenses for tickets, food, and rides.

The cost of the tickets for three friends is $20.25. 

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, so it's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's calculate the total cost: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

To find out how much each friend paid, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

Therefore, each friend paid $34.

The final answer is $34."
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to consider his collection rate and the duration of his collection.

John collects 2 peaches per minute. Since he collects for 3 hours, we need to convert the time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of peaches collected by multiplying the collection rate by the total minutes: 
2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To determine the daily insect intake for a flock of ducks, we need to consider their weekly insect requirements. A duck's weekly insect intake is 3.5 pounds. 

For a flock of ten ducks, the total weekly insect intake would be 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds.

To find the daily insect intake, we divide the total weekly intake by 7 days:
35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, a flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left, we need to consider the net change in the number of trees over 10 years and then account for the trees that die.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, resulting in a net gain of 8 trees per year. Over 10 years, this equates to a net gain of 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Starting with 50 trees, Tom's total after 10 years would be 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39.

Therefore, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To determine the difference between the number of pink and white plastic flamingos, let's break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine how much change Violetta will get after buying the crayons, we need to calculate the total cost of the crayons and subtract it from the amount of money she has.

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors and one crayon costs $2, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Total number of crayons she can buy = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons she can buy = 10

The total cost of the crayons is the number of crayons multiplied by the cost of one crayon.

Total cost of crayons = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 * $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

Now, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money Violetta has.

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

The final answer is: $0"
"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we first need to establish the cost of a single pen. Since a pencil and an eraser combined cost the same as a pen, and a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of a pen by adding these two values.

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we can calculate the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of a single pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"When distributing 200 pounds of carrots to 40 restaurants, each receiving 2 pounds, we need to determine the amount of carrots that will not be used.

To calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed, we multiply the pounds per restaurant by the number of restaurants:

2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, let's find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used by subtracting the total pounds distributed from the initial amount:

Initial amount = 200 pounds
Total pounds distributed = 80 pounds
Pounds not used = Initial amount - Total pounds distributed = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we need to consider the number of sentences he edits for each publisher and the rate at which they pay him.

Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount he earns from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, the total amount Mark earns from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we add the amounts he earns from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both his increased salary and the one-time monetary reward from the award.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise in his weekly salary:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = 100
New weekly salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John works every week of the year, we'll multiply his new weekly salary by the number of weeks he works:
Total weekly earnings = New weekly salary * Number of weeks
= 2100 * 52
= 109200

In addition to his increased earnings, John also receives a one-time monetary reward of $5000 for the award.

Total earnings for the year = Total weekly earnings + One-time reward
= 109200 + 5000
= 114200

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year are $114200."

"To determine the total amount of cheese Carl consumed, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and then add them together.

First, let's consider the cheese used for sandwiches. Since Carl had a sandwich every day for a week, that's 7 days. He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, so the total slices used for sandwiches would be 7 * 2 = 14.

Next, we'll look at the cheese used for omelets. Carl had omelets for 3 days, and he used one more slice of cheese per omelet than per sandwich. That means he used 3 slices per omelet. So, the total slices used for omelets would be 3 * 3 = 9.

Now, let's consider the cheese used for the macaroni and cheese dish. Carl used 8 slices of cheese for this dish.

To find the total amount of cheese used, we add the slices used for each meal together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to her initial number of pens.

Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.
Janet bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

The total number of new pens she bought is 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

"To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to consider the total score she requires for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we can calculate the total score needed by multiplying 93 by 6.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Now, we can find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test by subtracting the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Next, we need to find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we can find the total weight of the bag of candy by adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g.

"To find the cost of each cup, we need to determine the total cost of twenty dozen cups and then divide it by the number of cups.

First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the items she wants to buy is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of two pairs of shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

"To determine the number of red chickens, we need to consider the egg production and the relationship between the red and white chickens. Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

"When it comes to physical activity, walking is an excellent way to maintain cardiovascular health and boost overall well-being. In this case, let's calculate the time Gary spends walking around the local park, which is a rectangle measuring 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

To determine the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now, let's calculate the time Gary spends walking at a speed of 3 miles/hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the local park.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to analyze the given information. 

Let's break down the data:

- On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
- On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
- The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to subtract the total customers on the first and second days from the total by the third day.

Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

The final answer is: 250"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the rate at which the water is leaking from both pools and the relationship between the amount of water in the two pools.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is 2x gallons.

The rate at which the water is leaking from both pools is 4 gallons/minute. Since 4 minutes have passed, the total amount of water leaked from both pools is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 gallons (since 4 gallons leaked out). The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 4 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford her purchase, we need to consider the total cost of the items she wants to buy. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00, which equals $352.00. Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours she needs to work by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To determine the average age of the three individuals in three years, we first need to establish their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, we can deduce the ages of the other two individuals based on the given relationships. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Furthermore, Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the points scored by Jojo, we need to calculate the points scored by the other three students first. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. 

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To determine the percentage chance of picking a water type card from James' collection, we need to calculate the total number of cards and the number of water type cards after the changes.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. He loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 grass type cards.

First, let's calculate the total number of cards after losing 8 water type cards:
- Total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) - 8 (lost water) = 82

Then, he buys 14 grass type cards:
- Total cards = 82 + 14 = 96
- Grass type cards = 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32

Now, we can calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
= (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.333...%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33.

"To determine the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months. 30% of the initial 120 watermelons were ready, which is 0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons.

Next, we calculate the number of watermelons remaining after two months: 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. This is equivalent to 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons.

To find the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we subtract the number of harvested melons from the remaining melons: 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs to grow his cherry tomatoes, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he and his girlfriend consume per week. 

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 3 tomatoes per day. 

To find the total number of tomatoes they eat per week, we multiply their daily consumption by 7: 
Steve's consumption: 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week
Girlfriend's consumption: 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find the number of vines needed: 
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

"To determine the total number of pens Ram gets, we need to consider the process of refilling pens with ink from empty ones. 

When Ram buys 25 pens, he can use the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. This means that the ink from 25 pens can be used to make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, these 5 new pens will also eventually run out of ink, and he can use the ink from these 5 pens to make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens made from the first 25 pens, plus the 1 new pen made from the 5 empty pens. This gives us a total of 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 pens.

"To determine the time Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 6 hours a week writing.

"To determine the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin, let's analyze the situation step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Then, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. This leaves Griffin with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries. Colby then took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We have two aquariums with an equal number of fish, denoted as x. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. We can express this as an equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To find the value of x, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2 to isolate x:

7 = x

This means there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total cost of the makeup services, we need to consider the daily cost, the number of days worked per week, and the total duration of the project.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works 6 hours a day. Therefore, the daily cost is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since the makeup artist works 4 days a week, the weekly cost is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie production takes 5 weeks to complete, so the total cost for the makeup services is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After completing the project, the makeup artist offers a 10% discount on the total cost. This discount is calculated as 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000.

To find the final amount Jean paid, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the amount each person paid for Isabelle's little sister's birthday party, we need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies and then divide it by the number of people splitting the cost.

The total cost of the party supplies includes the cost of ingredients for the cake ($12), birthday presents ($43), decorations ($15), invitations ($4), and goodie bags ($22).

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

The total cost of the onions is $300."
"To determine the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister, we need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate and then multiply it by the calories per cookie.

Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, for a total of 18 cookies. 

Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, which is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, which is 2 * 13 = 26 cookies. So, Sue ate a total of 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue's total calorie intake is 46 * 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister's total calorie intake is 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

The school is 50% girls, so the total number of girls in the school is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

The number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30.

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33.

The number of boys in the third class is 30 - 33 = -3. However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of students.

Let's re-evaluate the information given. We know that the first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. The total number of girls in the first two classes is 27. Since the school is 50% girls, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

The total number of students in the third class is 20. Since there are 3 girls in the third class, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"Let's analyze the situation. Travis initially had 61 apps on his tablet. He then deleted 9 apps, which means he had 61 - 9 = 52 apps left. After that, he downloaded 18 new apps, so we need to add those to the remaining apps: 52 + 18 = 70.

The final number of apps on Travis's tablet is 70."
"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed last night and today.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night. 

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46.
The total number of cougars killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

The final answer is: 73"
"To determine the floor Bill is on, we need to calculate the floor he rides the elevator to. This can be found by multiplying his starting floor by 4 and then adding 6.

First, we multiply his starting floor by 4: 3 * 4 = 12

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide first. 

To find 30% of 30, we multiply 0.3 by 30, which equals 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 
21 * 4 = 84.

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we need to calculate the total number of cows Mr. Sylas added to the stalls and then multiply that by the number of stalls.

Initially, each of the 10 stalls had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

Number of cows added to each stall = Total cows bought / Number of stalls
= 40 / 10
= 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 * 8
= 192

The final answer is: 192"
"Let's break down the piggy bank contents into their respective values.

First, we'll calculate the value of the coins. 
- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2

Next, we'll calculate the value of the dollar bills.
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together:
$1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

The final answer is: $45"
"To determine the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section.

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. 

30% of 8000 is 0.3 * 8000 = 2400. 

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

The final weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of its wood is 5600 pounds."
"To determine the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to consider the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.

The cost of the overdue books is calculated by multiplying the number of books by the cost per book. In this case, there are 8 books, and each book costs $0.50. Therefore, the total cost of the overdue books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.

Additionally, there is a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we add the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

"To determine the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person has and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and she has 52 apples, we can calculate Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from Andrea's total: 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, we add 4 to Jamal's apple count to find his banana count: 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Now, we know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. To find Andrea's banana count, we divide Jamal's banana count by 2: 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs to bake the cookies, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then divide that by the number of cookies per cup of flour.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5. 

Since 5.5 dozens is the same as 5 dozen and 6 cookies, we need to calculate the flour needed for 6 cookies. 6 cookies is half of a dozen, so we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we need to add the flour needed for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. 5 dozen cookies need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

So, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount of two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate two thirds of 9,300.

Two thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"Let's calculate the total number of marbles Maddison has now.

To do this, we need to consider the initial number of marbles she has and the additional marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, so she has a total of 5 x 50 = 250 marbles.

She then receives 20 marbles from her friend.

To find the new total, we add the initial number of marbles to the marbles she received: 250 + 20 = 270.

Therefore, Maddison now has 270 marbles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To determine the difference in the number of trees between Harry's and Ferdinand's yards, we need to calculate the number of trees each of them has.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. Since Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

So, Harry has 11 trees.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to calculate their individual amounts first.

Carmen has $100. 
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up their individual amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

"To determine the total cost of the house, we need to consider the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. 

The selling price of the house is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference between the total price and her budget is $409,500 - $400,000 = $4,500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to consider the various expenses associated with the transaction. 

First, let's calculate the transfer fees, which amount to 3% of the selling price. This can be calculated as 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000. 

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price. This can be calculated as 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

The total fees paid by Mr. Tan would be the sum of the transfer fees and the brokerage fee, which is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, we need to subtract the total fees from the selling price to determine the net selling price. This would be $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

However, Mr. Tan also has a remaining loan amount of $250,000 that he needs to pay. To find his net proceeds, we subtract this amount from the net selling price: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

"When it comes to cooking chicken, the initial step is to heat the oil to a specific temperature. In this case, it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. However, the oil needs to be heated further to reach the desired temperature of 400 degrees.

To determine the additional time required to heat the oil to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of the initial 20 minutes. This is equivalent to 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. Therefore, it takes a total of 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

Once the oil has reached the optimal temperature, the cooking process can begin. It's essential to note that the cooking time is 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat the oil. Consequently, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

In total, the time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the heating time and the cooking time: 28 minutes (heating to 400 degrees) + 23 minutes (cooking) = 51 minutes.

"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag contains 300 M&Ms. 
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it contains 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, which is 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows in the houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows not connected to bedrooms.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. Therefore, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

In addition to the windows in the bedrooms, there are 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. With 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

To find the total number of windows, we add the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows: 12 + 8 = 20.

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."

Therefore, the cashier should give the mother $6.00 in change."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

Therefore, the number of stitches for each sleeve is 315."

First, let's calculate the cost of the tomato seeds. Since she bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 per packet, the total cost of the tomato seeds is 20 * $40 = $800.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the celery seeds. With 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 per packet, the total cost of the celery seeds is 80 * $30 = $2400.

Now, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds together to find the total amount spent on seeds. $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is $3200."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize for his theater production, we need to break down the information provided.

First, let's consider the solo song. It has 54 lines that Sean needs to memorize.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which means it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's lines, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, which gives us a total of 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, we calculate this as (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

Therefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is 138.

"When it comes to physical labor, it's essential to consider the cumulative time spent on various tasks, especially when they involve repetitive activities like digging. In this scenario, Matthew is tasked with digging 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

First, let's calculate the time required for each type of hole. Digging a small hole takes 3 minutes, and digging a large hole takes 10 minutes. 

For the small holes, the total time is 3 minutes per hole multiplied by 30 holes, which equals 90 minutes. For the large holes, the total time is 10 minutes per hole multiplied by 15 holes, which equals 150 minutes.

Now, let's add these times together to get the total time spent on digging: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert this total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to consider their current ages. Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as m. We know that the sum of their ages is 20, which can be expressed as M + m = 20.

In 10 years, both Mico and Marco will age by 10 years. Therefore, their ages in 10 years will be M + 10 and m + 10, respectively. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

Since M + m = 20, we can substitute this into the equation (M + 10) + (m + 10) to get 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 60.

The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years is 60."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish a relationship between Ruby's and Sam's ages. Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

We are given two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can use these equations to solve for S by substituting the first equation into the second equation.

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is: 6"

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"When planning a large gathering, it's essential to consider the number of people and the amount of food needed to ensure everyone is satisfied. In this scenario, Maddy is buying pizza for her cousin's soccer game. 

First, let's calculate the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we need to find the total length of the space between the gemstones. 

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

Now, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: 1.75 / (1/4) = 1.75 / 0.25 = 7.

Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace is 7.

"When it comes to creative expression and writing, engaging in activities like storytelling can have numerous benefits for children's cognitive development and emotional well-being. In this case, Alani, Braylen, and Margot have been writing stories, and their family has asked them to share their work at the end of the weekend.

Let's break down the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week. Alani wrote 20 stories, while her brother Braylen wrote 40 stories. Her sister Margot, on the other hand, wrote 60 stories.

To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we need to add the number of stories written by each of them.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. This means Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = 120 + 240 = 360

"To determine how many cents Kelly has left after buying a can of pop, we need to calculate the total value of her initial coins and then subtract the cost of the pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of her quarters is 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. Therefore, the total value of her dimes is 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

The total amount Kelly has is the sum of the value of her quarters and dimes, which is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount she has.

145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left after buying the can of pop."
"To determine the number of rows of 5-star rows on the flag, we need to calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. To find the total weight of the flagstones, we multiply the weight of one flagstone by the total number of flagstones:
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks, which is 2000 pounds per truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance, we need to consider the speed and distance traveled by both cars.

The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and it covers a distance of 480 miles. To find the time taken by this car, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.

time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the same formula to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane:
time = distance / speed = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to consider the information provided. Ali, a skilled counter, has won 22 medals. His friend Izzy, also an accomplished counter, has 5 fewer medals than Ali, which means Izzy has 17 medals.

When we combine their medal count, we get 22 (Ali's medals) + 17 (Izzy's medals) = 39 medals. However, it's stated that together, they have 10 times fewer medals than the total number of medals given out for counting.

Let's denote the total number of medals given out as 'x'. This implies that 10x = 39, as Ali and Izzy's combined medal count is 39.

To find the value of 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9."
"When it comes to sharing chocolate bars among children, it's essential to consider the overall nutritional value and potential impact on their health. However, in this scenario, we're focusing on the distribution of chocolate bars.

First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. There are 8 packets, each containing 5 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars allocated to the adults. Each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, let's find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total: 40 - 24 = 16.

To distribute the remaining chocolate bars among the children, we divide the number of remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Susan's earnings for the online task, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a 3-hour period. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes first.

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the total points of the three friends after the extra points had been distributed, we need to calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 21 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82.

The final answer is: $\boxed{82}$"
"To determine the number of unwashed oranges, we need to calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 4 years old. 
He washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, to find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 
15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the total count of activities Darren performed in two days, we need to calculate the number of exercises for each day and add them together.

On the first day, Darren completed 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

On the second day, he increased his pushups by 20, reduced his squats by 10, and doubled his dumbbell presses.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Total for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total count of activities in two days: 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household with 5 members who consume rice for both lunch and dinner, we need to calculate the daily rice consumption.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. Therefore, each person's daily rice consumption is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

For a household with 5 members, the total daily rice consumption is 5 * 0.4 kg = 2 kg.

To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the daily consumption (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

The target for the week is 120 crates. To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target.

Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk, we need to calculate the sum of the bids made by Carmen and the other 3 bidders. 

The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. Since there are 3 other bidders, each making one bid, and Carmen bids after each of them, there are a total of 4 bids made by the other bidders and 4 bids made by Carmen, resulting in a total of 8 bids.

The total amount bid is the sum of an arithmetic series with the first term a = 200, the common difference d = 50, and the number of terms n = 8.

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d)

Plugging in the values, we get:
S = (8/2) * (2*200 + (8-1)*50)
S = 4 * (400 + 7*50)
S = 4 * (400 + 350)
S = 4 * 750
S = 3000

The final answer is: $3000"
"To determine the total cost of John's driving service, we need to consider the total miles driven, the driving cost, and the bonus he gives his driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven. Since John commutes to work and back each day, the daily mileage is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. With a 5-day workweek, the weekly mileage is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. Over the course of 50 weeks in a year, the total mileage is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Next, we calculate the driving cost. John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total driving cost per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

In addition to the driving cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. This translates to $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

To find the total cost, we add the driving cost and the bonus: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To determine the amount of time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. To find the combined total, we add these two values together.

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Now, we need to calculate twice the combined total, as Peter wants to exercise for this amount on Tuesday. To do this, we multiply the combined total by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"When considering the production of a 32-page tabloid, it's essential to understand the folding process and how the pages are arranged. 

In a standard folding process, a piece of paper is folded in half, creating two sides. For a tabloid with 32 pages, we can visualize the arrangement as follows:

- The first page is on the left back, and the second page is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back, and the 31st page is on the right front.

This pattern continues, alternating between the left and right sides of the folded paper. Since each piece of paper can be folded in half, we need to determine the number of pieces required to accommodate all 32 pages.

Considering the alternating pattern, we can see that each piece of paper can be used to print two pages. Therefore, to find the total number of pieces of paper needed, we can divide the total number of pages by 2.

32 pages / 2 pages per piece of paper = 16 pieces of paper

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are printed on both sides of the paper. Since the question asks for the number of pieces of paper, we need to consider that each piece of paper can be folded in half, creating two sides.

To accommodate the 32 pages, we need 16 pieces of paper, but since each piece can be folded in half, we actually need 8 pieces of paper to create the necessary sides.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine how much money Annika has left after visiting the town fair, we need to consider her expenses. She spent half of her initial $50 on food and snacks, which is a significant portion of her budget.

To calculate this, we divide $50 by 2, resulting in $25 spent on food and snacks. Additionally, she spent $10 on rides.

The total amount spent is the sum of these two expenses: $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 (initial amount) - $35 (total spent) = $15.

This leaves Annika with $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to calculate the number of books she sold in that year. 

We know that Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. 

Let's start by finding the number of books sold in the second year. Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting the number of unsold books, the number of books sold this year, and the number of books sold in the first year from the total number of books:
Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To determine Watson's total earnings for April, we need to consider his hourly wage and the weekly bonus he receives.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week. Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. Therefore, his total hours worked in a week are:
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Given that Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Additionally, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Since April has 4 weeks, we can calculate Watson's total earnings for the month by multiplying his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in April:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"When it comes to arm wrestling, the outcome can be influenced by a variety of factors, including physical strength, technique, and mental preparation. However, in this scenario, we're focusing on the percentage of matches won.

If John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them, we can calculate the number of people he lost to by finding the remaining percentage.

80% of 20 people is 0.8 * 20 = 16 people. 

To find the number of people John lost to, we subtract this from the total number of people he arm wrestled: 20 - 16 = 4.

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, let's break down the bakery's daily sales.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning. To find this amount, we multiply 60 by 2/3.

60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. This is done by subtracting the morning sales from the total number of loaves produced.

60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we need to find half of 20.

20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

Therefore, the bakery sells 10 loaves of bread in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to understand the weight loss rate of both individuals.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Since Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight in the same amount of time as Joey, we need to multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds by 4.

"When it comes to making smart purchasing decisions, especially when it comes to essential items like dairy products, being aware of discounts can make a significant difference in our overall expenses. 

Let's break down the savings on the items in question. 

For the tubs of ice cream, the original price of 2 tubs is 2 x $13 = $26. With the discount, the price drops to 2 x $11 = $22. This means you save $4 on the tubs of ice cream.

Moving on to the packets of milk, the original price of 4 packets is 4 x $1 = $4. With a discount of $0.5 per packet, the price drops to 4 x $0.5 = $2. This results in a savings of $4 - $2 = $2 on the packets of milk.

To find the total savings, we add the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"When analyzing the effects of the Lots-of-Limbs Serum, it's essential to consider the growth rate of both arms and legs. The serum causes the drinker to grow an extra arm every three days and an extra leg every five days.

To determine the total number of new limbs after 15 days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs separately.

Extra arms: 
- The person grows an extra arm every 3 days. 
- In 15 days, the person will grow 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Extra legs: 
- The person grows an extra leg every 5 days. 
- In 15 days, the person will grow 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

Total new limbs = extra arms + extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8

Therefore, after 15 days, the Lots-of-Limbs Serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for his expenses and savings.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600.

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150.

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times this amount is $500. Therefore, the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of these items: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

To find out how much Theo has left, we subtract the total cost from his initial budget: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost) = $4050.

However, Theo wants to save $2000 for his trip. To find out how much he has left for gifts, we subtract the amount he wants to save from his remaining budget: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

Since he wants to save $2000, he has $2050 - $2000 = $50 left over, which he can spend on gifts.

The final answer is: $50"
"When it comes to egg consumption, it's essential to consider the nutritional needs of the family members. In this scenario, we have a family of 5, with 3 individuals consuming 3 eggs each day and the remaining 2 individuals consuming 2 eggs each day.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the 3 individuals who eat 3 eggs each day. This is simply 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the 2 individuals who eat 2 eggs each day, which is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Now, we add the total number of eggs consumed by both groups to find the daily egg consumption: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

To determine the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume a total of 91 eggs in a week.

The final answer is: 91"
"To determine Trent's age, we need to establish the age of the individuals involved. Since Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can calculate Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the ages of Noah and Cera, and how it relates to the population of Chile.

Let's start by determining Cera's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, we subtract 6 from her current age to find her age at that time: 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

Now, we know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Given that Cera was 40 years old at that time, Noah's age would be half of Cera's age, which is 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old at that time, the population of Chile six years ago would be 3000 * 20 = 60000.

However, we are told that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, to find the current population of Chile, we need to multiply the population six years ago by 2: 60000 * 2 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"To determine the number of players on the defense, we need to consider the distribution of players among the offense, defense, and special teams. 

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

We are given that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the number of people attending Martha's Christmas party, we need to consider the total number of people invited and then subtract those who are unable to attend.

First, let's calculate the total number of people invited. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people.

2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. This leaves us with 24 - 8 = 16 people.

But, 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. To find this number, we calculate 8 / 4 = 2 people. These 2 people are also unable to attend the party.

Now, we subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited.
16 - 2 = 14 people

Therefore, 14 people will show up for Martha's party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon initially had a store with 50 marbles. He then bought 20 more marbles from Johanna, bringing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find this amount, we calculate 2/5 of 20, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kilograms.

The final answer is: 156"
"To determine the cost of filling a pool, we need to calculate its volume in cubic feet. The pool's dimensions are given as 6 feet in length, 4 feet in width, and 5 feet in depth.

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height. 

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost. The cost per cubic foot is $0.1.

Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we need to consider the given ratios and the number of boys.

The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys. Given that there are 30 boys, we can calculate the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3:
Girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Additionally, the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we multiply the number of boys by 1/10:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we can calculate the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To determine the total number of electric poles required to supply electricity in a neighborhood, we need to consider the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This ratio indicates that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires required is 45, we can use this information to calculate the number of electric poles needed. We can set up a proportion to solve for the number of electric poles:

1:3 = x:45

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate x:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the number of women left at the party, we need to understand the initial number of people and the number of people who left.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people at the party.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find out how many people left, we calculate 1/4 of 40, which is 10.

Since 10 people left, the number of people remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were 25 men initially, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 (because 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men).

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the cost of the pen, we need to establish the cost of the magazine first. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, we can calculate the magazine's cost by dividing the book's cost by 2. 

The magazine's cost is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, we can find the pen's cost by subtracting $1 from the magazine's cost.

The pen's cost is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we first need to find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Her sister, Meg, has 46 pencils.

The total number of pencils they have together is 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Since each box contains 8 pencils, we can find the number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's analyze the impact of the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes required to achieve this temperature change. 

Assuming the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees, we want to cool it down to 35 degrees. The temperature difference is 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. So, the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since 5 ice cubes are added, the coffee becomes 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes.

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. The cream also weakens the coffee, so we add this to the weakening caused by the ice cubes.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To determine the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people, we need to consider the ratio of old records to new records. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the ratio is 2:1.

Given that the 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded. Since the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, the total number of old records traded is twice the number of new records.

Total number of new records = 7
Total number of old records traded = 2 * Total number of new records
Total number of old records traded = 2 * 7
Total number of old records traded = 14

Since all 5 people brought in the same number of old records, we can divide the total number of old records traded by 5 to find the number of old records each person brought in.

Number of old records per person = Total number of old records traded / Number of people
Number of old records per person = 14 / 5
Number of old records per person = 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records brought in.

Total number of old records = Number of old records per person * Number of people
Total number of old records = 2.8 * 5
Total number of old records = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. We know that junior programmers make up 2/5 of the total number of employees. Given that there are 100 employees in total, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the remaining employees are senior programmers. Therefore, the number of senior programmers is:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers. Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, so:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Next, we need to determine the salary of senior programmers. We know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so:

Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid to senior programmers:

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Finally, we can calculate the total amount paid to all programmers by adding the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 
At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5. 
At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. 
Then, 8 more people got in, so the total became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6. 
We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine Oscar's current lollipop count, let's break down the events step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. On his way to school, he consumes 2, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he shares 14 lollipops with his friends, reducing his count to 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

After school, Oscar purchases twice the number of lollipops he gave away, which is 2 * 14 = 28. Adding these to his existing lollipops, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, Oscar consumes 3 more lollipops, bringing his count down to 36 - 3 = 33.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Considering the impact of excessive sugar consumption on dental health, it's essential to note that frequent eating of lollipops can lead to tooth decay and other oral health issues. A balanced diet and regular oral hygiene practices are crucial for maintaining good health.

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the time it takes to fully charge a cell phone that is currently at 60% charged, we need to calculate the remaining charge. Since the phone needs to reach 100% charge, we subtract the current charge from the total charge: 100% - 60% = 40%.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to charge the remaining 40%, we multiply the remaining charge by the charging rate: 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 hours.

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we need to consider the changes in her lollipop count. Initially, Erin has 7 lollipops. Her mother then gives her 10 more, increasing her total to 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

However, Erin decides to share some of her lollipops with Ella, giving her 3. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to subtract the number of lollipops she gave away from her total. 

17 (initial lollipops after receiving more) - 3 (lollipops given away) = 14

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To determine the amount the customer paid on their shopping trip, we need to consider the rewards earned from their previous purchase and the coupon applied to the current purchase.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which earns them $1 off for every $20 spent. This means they earned 4 rewards, as $80 / $20 = 4. 

These rewards can be applied to their current shopping trip, which they spent $43 on. The rewards of $4 can be subtracted from the initial price of $43, resulting in a new price of $39.

The customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon is worth 2 * $4 = $8. Subtracting this from the new price of $39 results in a final price of $31.

Therefore, the customer paid $31 on their shopping trip.

The final answer is: $31"
"When evaluating two job opportunities, it's essential to consider the total take-home pay, which is the amount of money you'll actually receive after taxes. Let's break down the details of each job.

Job A pays $15 per hour for 2000 hours a year, which translates to a total income of $30,000 per year. Since there's no mention of property tax for this job, we can proceed with calculating the income tax. Assuming a 20% tax rate, the income tax would be $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. Therefore, the net income for Job A would be $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B, on the other hand, offers a total income of $42,000 per year. However, there's an additional $6,000 property tax, which reduces the net income before taxes to $36,000. With a 10% tax rate applied to the net income before taxes, the income tax would be $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. Consequently, the net income for Job B would be $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we compare the net incomes of both jobs. Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B provides a higher net pay.

Now, let's calculate the difference in net pay between the two jobs. Subtracting the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B gives us $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we first need to determine the total number of ruined castles. Since 40% of the 220 castles are ruins, we can calculate this by multiplying 220 by 0.4.

220 * 0.4 = 88

Now, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find this number, we need to divide the total number of ruined castles by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine the cost difference between two furniture offers, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer. 

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. To find the total cost, we add the advance payment to the total of the monthly installments. The total of the monthly installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. To find the total cost, we add the advance payment to the total of the monthly installments. The total of the monthly installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we must consider the sugar requirements for both suckers and fudge. 

For suckers, Mason requires 30 ounces of sugar per batch. If he plans to make 8 batches, the total sugar needed would be 8 x 30 ounces = 240 ounces.

For fudge, Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar per batch. Since he plans to make only 1 batch, the sugar requirement remains 70 ounces.

To find the total sugar needed, we add the sugar required for suckers and fudge: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

The final answer is: 310"
"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to consider the changes in the stock price over two years.

First, let's calculate the price increase in the first year. A 50% increase in the stock price means the price is multiplied by 1.5. The initial price of each share is $8, so after the first year, the price becomes $8 * 1.5 = $12.

Next, we need to calculate the price decrease in the second year. A 25% decrease in the stock price means the price is multiplied by 0.75. The price after the first year is $12, so after the second year, the price becomes $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we can find the total value of Maria's shares by multiplying the price of each share after the second year by the total number of shares. Maria has 8 shares, so the total value is $9 * 8 = $72.

"When it comes to hot dog consumption, it's essential to consider the nutritional value and potential health implications. However, in this scenario, we're focusing on the quantity of hot dogs consumed.

Let's break down the information provided: Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas, on the other hand, consumed three times more hot dogs than Luke, which means Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

Now, let's consider John's hot dog intake. He ate half the amount Thomas consumed, so John had 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To determine how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to calculate the difference between their hot dog consumption: 3 - 2 = 1.

Therefore, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's consider the distribution of students into three groups. We know that two of the groups have an equal number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two.

Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as x. The number of students in the smallest group would then be x - 10.

Since the total number of students in the class is 200, we can set up an equation to represent the sum of the students in all three groups:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms to simplify the equation:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with the variable:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:

x = 70

Now that we know the number of students in each of the two equal groups, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the total number of legs of the animals on Farmer Brown's farm, we need to consider the number of chickens and cows. Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, which means H + C = 60. Additionally, we are given that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so H = 2C.

Substituting H = 2C into the first equation, we get 2C + C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60. To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Since H = 2C, we can find the value of H by multiplying C by 2, resulting in H = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"To determine the number of balls Josh has left to juggle, we need to consider his initial practice and the events that occurred during the talent show.

Josh starts practicing juggling with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. This means he has practiced with 3 + 4 = 7 balls.

During the talent show, Josh drops 3 balls, but 2 of them are caught by the audience. This means only 1 ball is lost.

So, Josh starts juggling with 7 balls and loses 1, leaving him with 7 - 1 = 6 balls.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, we need to calculate the weights of the other animals and then add them to the weight of the container.

First, let's establish the weight of each animal. 

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds, as it is the same as the pink frog.
3. The green toad also weighs 50 pounds, as it is the same as the pink frog.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of the animals and the container:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds

The final answer is: 260"
"To determine the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we need to consider the outfits she received from her friend, the new outfits she got at the baby shower, and the outfits her mom gifted her.

Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits. At the baby shower, she received twice the amount of new outfits, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits. This is a significant increase in the number of outfits she has available for her baby.

Her mom gifted her an additional 15 baby outfits, which further adds to the total number of outfits.

To find the total number of outfits, we simply add the number of outfits from each source: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87.

Therefore, Laurel now has a total of 87 baby outfits for her child.

The final answer is: 87"
"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice.

The coach wants Tyson to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find this additional distance, we divide the original daily distance by 5. 

The original daily distance is 5000 meters. 

1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 / 5 = 1000 meters.

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

Therefore, the total distance covered in June is 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"When it comes to making informed choices about our daily expenses, understanding the prices of various items can be crucial. In this case, we're comparing the prices of three different juice boxes: A, B, and C.

Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. Juice Box B is priced 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, which means it costs 9 dollars. On the other hand, Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, making it a 11-dollar purchase.

To determine how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we need to find the difference between their prices. By subtracting the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C, we get 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

Therefore, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more expensive than Juice Box B.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of legs in the restaurant, we need to consider the number of tables with 4 legs and the number of tables with 3 legs.

First, let's calculate the number of legs for the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

Next, we'll calculate the number of legs for the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of tables to find the total: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"To determine how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to consider the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, which amounts to 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, totaling 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The combined total of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since each bag contains 36 cookies, and 27 are used by her son and husband, the remaining cookies are eaten by Jenny.

36 - 27 = 9

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"When it comes to making smart financial decisions, understanding discounts can be a crucial aspect of saving money. In this case, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts Davos bought from the mall.

First, we need to find the discount amount. The discount is 40% of the original price of the shirts, which is $30 each. To calculate the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

Discount = 40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt.

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to get the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2 = $36

Therefore, Davos paid a total of $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in the amount the factory makes per day, we need to calculate the difference in their daily earnings before and after switching from making tractors to silos.

The factory sold 10 tractors a day at $100 per tractor, resulting in a daily income of 10 * $100 = $1000.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day at $220 per silo, resulting in a daily income of 5 * $220 = $1100.

The difference in their daily earnings is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we calculate ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they made tractors.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total annual expenditure on a dog's care, we need to consider the costs of food, treats, and medicine. 

First, let's calculate the monthly cost of food. Since the dog requires food for 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly cost by 4:
Food cost per month = $25 * 4 = $100

Next, we add the monthly costs of treats and medicine to the food cost:
Total monthly cost = $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine)
Total monthly cost = $220

To find the total annual expenditure, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
Total annual cost = Total monthly cost * 12
Total annual cost = $220 * 12
Total annual cost = $2640

The final answer is: $2640"
"To determine the total time Peyton will spend on after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them up.

Peyton's schedule includes a one-hour yoga class on Monday. This is a great way to relax and unwind after a long day.

On Tuesday, Peyton has a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga class. Since Monday's yoga class is one hour, the cooking class will be 3 * 1 = 3 hours long.

On Wednesday, Peyton has a half-hour cheese-tasting event. This is a wonderful opportunity to try new flavors and socialize with others.

On Thursday, Peyton has a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class. Since the cooking class is 3 hours long, the museum tour will be 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.

Finally, on Friday, Peyton has two hours of errands. This is a great way to take care of any last-minute tasks and get everything organized.

Now, let's add up the time for all activities:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The total time Peyton will spend on after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs for the garden. 

For the daisies, she requires 30 plant pots. Since she also needs twice as many for the roses, we calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses as 2 * 30 = 60.

The total number of plant pots required is the sum of the plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses, which is 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April had already purchased 100 plant pots from the garden center, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To determine how much Andrea saved, we need to consider her initial amount of money and the expenses she incurred. 

Andrea initially had $36. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. To find out how much she saved, we need to subtract her total expenses from her initial amount.

Total expenses = $11 (sweater) + $4 (given to brother) = $15

Amount saved = Initial amount - Total expenses

"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we need to calculate the total time he spent on his activities and then find 40% of that total.

First, let's calculate the time spent on boating and swimming. John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Next, we'll calculate the time spent watching shows. Since John watched 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, we can add up the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

However, we know that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. To find the total time, we can set up an equation: 30% of total time = 6 hours. We can solve for the total time by dividing 6 by 0.30, which gives us 20 hours.

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. To do this, we multiply 20 hours by 0.40, which gives us 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine how much money Annabelle still needs to save for the phone, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work, which amounts to $200. 

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work, totaling $75.

Her total earnings from both jobs are $200 + $75 = $275.

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. To find out how much more she needs, we subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $275 = $125.

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we need to calculate the combined height of the two shorter trees first. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Now, let's find the combined height of the two shorter trees: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so we multiply the combined height by 2: 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine how much money Dean has left, we need to consider the total amount he spent on toys and the additional funds provided by his mother.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 = $12
Next, we'll calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 = $5
Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears: $12 + $5 = $17
Dean initially received $28 from his mother, and she later gave him an extra $10, so he now has a total of $28 + $10 = $38
Finally, let's subtract the amount Dean spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract that from her dad's budget.

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $35 = 1.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.57 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $55 - $5 = $50. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$50 / $35 = 1.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.43 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $50 - $20 = $30. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$30 / $35 = 0.86

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.86 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the mini-golf in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $30 - $5 = $25. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$25 / $35 = 0.71

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.71 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $25 - $5 = $20. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$20 / $35 = 0.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.57 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $20 - $5 = $15.

$15 / $35 = 0.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.43 ≈ 0

$10 / $35 = 0.29

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.29 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $10 - $5 = $5. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$5 / $35 = 0.14

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.14 ≈ 0

"To determine how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply it by the number of days she saves.

First, let's calculate her daily expenses on lollipops. Each lollipop costs $0.25, and she buys 4 of them every day. So, her daily expenses on lollipops are 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's calculate her daily savings. She receives $5 as pocket money every day, and her daily expenses on lollipops are $1. Therefore, her daily savings are $5 - $1 = $4.

To find out her total savings over 5 days, we multiply her daily savings by the number of days: $4 x 5 = $20.

Therefore, Marisa saves $20 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to consider his initial budget and the subsequent expenses. 

Billy started with $10. He spent an unknown amount on candy, which costs $1.5 per pound. Let's call the amount of candy he bought 'x' pounds. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x.

After buying the candy, Billy had 10 - 1.5x dollars left. He then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each. Since he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the age of Carver's son, we need to establish a relationship between their ages. Since Carver is 45 years old and 5 years less than twice his son's age, we can express this as an equation:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the number of days a train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance it travels in a day and then divide that by the distance it needs to travel before requiring service.

First, let's find the total distance the train travels in one trip. The train goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 125 miles from the third city to the first city (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs).

Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
Total distance in one trip: 300 miles
Total trips in a day: 3
Total distance in a day: 300 * 3 = 900 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we need to divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day.
Total distance between services: 18,000 miles
Total distance in a day: 900 miles
Number of days between services: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days

"To determine the amount of stuffing needed for custom dog beds, we need to consider the specific requirements for each breed. A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, while a chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds. A collie bed, being the average of the first two, requires 5 pounds of stuffing.

To calculate the total amount of stuffing needed, we need to find the total amount for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

For 4 chihuahua beds, we multiply the amount needed for one bed by 4: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
For 3 collie beds, we multiply the amount needed for one bed by 3: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount of stuffing needed for both types of beds: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To determine the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we get:

Time taken to drive to friend's house = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours (approximately).

However, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. To find the total distance, we add the detour to the original distance:

Total distance to friend's house = 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles.

Now, we recalculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house with the new distance:

Time taken to drive to friend's house = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the time taken to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph:

Time taken to drive back home = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Now, we add the time taken for both legs of the journey to find the total time:

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to friend's house + Time taken to drive back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to calculate the number of students present and then find the difference between the total number of students and the number of girls.

First, let's find the total number of students present. We know that 9 students were absent, so the number of students present is 96 - 9 = 87.

Next, we need to find the number of girls present. Since 5 girls were absent, the number of girls present is 43 - 5 = 38.

Now, we can find the number of boys present by subtracting the number of girls present from the total number of students present: 87 - 38 = 49.

Therefore, there were 49 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

The final answer is: 49"
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we need to consider the number of girls and boys present. Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

Given that there are 6 girls, the number of boys is 2 * 6 = 12.

To find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of boys and girls together: 6 (girls) + 12 (boys) = 18.

Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass, we need to consider her current score and the total points required for promotion.

Jane has taken two tests so far, scoring 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. To find the minimum points needed on the third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points.

Total required points = 42
Points scored in the first test = 15
Points scored in the second test = 18

Points scored so far = 15 + 18 = 33
Points needed on the third test = Total required points - Points scored so far
= 42 - 33
= 9

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to pass and be promoted to the next school year."
"To determine the number of people kicked out of the Walmart for reasons other than refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence, we need to calculate the total number of people kicked out for these reasons and subtract that from the overall total.

First, let's calculate the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. Since four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5 equals the number of people kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate this as follows:

4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

Next, we calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence. Since three times the number of people kicked out for shoplifting equals the number of people kicked out for physical violence, we can calculate this as follows:

3 * 7 = 21

Now, we know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we need to subtract the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total.

Number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks: 3
Number of people kicked out for shoplifting: 7
Number of people kicked out for physical violence: 21
Total number of people kicked out for these reasons: 3 + 7 + 21 = 31

Now, we can calculate the number of people kicked out for other reasons:

50 - 31 = 19

Therefore, the number of people kicked out of the Walmart for reasons other than refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence is 19.

The final answer is: 19"
"To determine Erin's points before, we need to understand the relationship between Erin's and Sara's points. It's given that Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. 

Let's calculate Erin's current points based on this information. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, Erin's current points would be 3 * 8 = 24. However, we are given that Erin actually has 14 points now.

To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to consider the difference between Erin's total points and her current points. Erin's total points would be the sum of her current points and Sara's points, which is 14 + 8 = 22. 

Now, to find Erin's points before, we subtract her current points from her total points: 22 - 14 = 8."
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to consider the expenses for picture frames, etching, pins, and cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20. With 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to account for the additional cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs 20% of the frame's cost, which is $4 per frame. Therefore, the total cost of etching for all 44 frames is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and etching together: $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Lastly, 1/4 of the seniors are officers and will receive cords that cost $12 each. Since 1/4 of 44 is 11, 11 seniors will receive cords. The total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

To find the total cost of all the gifts, we add the costs of the picture frames and etching, the pins, and the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To calculate the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to determine the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes. Each pair consists of 2 shoes, so the total number of shoes sold on Friday is 14 * 2 = 28.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 28 = 56 shoes.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 56 / 2 = 28 shoes.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. This leaves us with 28 - 12 = 16 shoes.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
28 (Friday) + 56 (Saturday) + 16 (Sunday) = 100 shoes.

The final answer is: 100"

Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. After feeding her 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the remaining rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we need to break down the information provided. 

First, we know that half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in the class, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

Next, we are told that one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils after those who like blue are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

Now, to find the number of pupils who like yellow, we need to subtract the total number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils in the class. The total number of pupils who like blue and green is 20 + 5 = 25.

Therefore, the number of pupils who like yellow is 40 - 25 = 15.

$56 / $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we add the number of apples picked on each day to find the total:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The total number of apples picked over the three days is 50."
"When it comes to laundry, it's essential to account for every item to avoid missing any essential items. In this case, Lindsay is washing 10 pairs of socks, which is equivalent to 20 individual socks (since each pair consists of two socks). Additionally, she is washing 15 loose socks.

To determine the total number of socks Lindsay has washed, we need to add the socks from the pairs and the loose socks. This gives us 20 (from the pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Now, to find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing. There are 50 socks in total, so 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we need to consider the initial amount of cookies she had, the additional cookies she received, and the cookies that were consumed.

First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Rachel had after receiving cookies from Janet. 

Initial cookies = 23
Cookies from Janet = 42
Total cookies = 23 + 42 = 65

Next, we need to subtract the number of cookies that Rachel's brother ate from the total number of cookies.

Cookies eaten by brother = 44
Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten by brother
Cookies left = 65 - 44
Cookies left = 21

Therefore, Rachel has 21 cookies left."
"To calculate the monthly payment for Karan's loan, we need to consider the total interest and the number of months she has to repay the loan.

The total interest is calculated as: Principal * Rate * Time
Principal = $3,650
Rate = 10% or 0.10
Time = 5 months

Total interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5 = $1,825

The total amount to be paid is the principal + interest = $3,650 + $1,825 = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
$5,475 / 5 = $1,095

"To calculate Millie's profit per hour, we need to consider the total revenue and the total cost of running her lemonade stand.

First, let's determine the total number of cups of lemonade she can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she has enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can produce 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

With each cup sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The initial investment for the supplies is $18. Therefore, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can make 36 cups in total, she will spend 36 / 4 = 9 hours selling all the lemonade.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to find the number of girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls.

However, on the day of the performance, half the people performing couldn't make it to the show due to their bus breaking down. This means that half of the girls couldn't make it, which is 26 / 2 = 13 girls.

The choir then decided to have their 3 teachers sing with the remaining girls. To find the total number of people who sang in the performance, we add the number of girls who made it to the show (26 - 13 = 13) to the number of teachers (3).

Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 + 3 = 16.

"When it comes to making the most of a fun day at the carnival, it's essential to consider the cost-effectiveness of different options. In this scenario, David and Dasha are planning to ride all 9 rides available at the carnival.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, making the total cost for one ride $4. If Dasha decides to buy individual tickets for all 9 rides, the total cost would be 9 * $4 = $36.

On the other hand, David chooses to purchase a ride bracelet for $30, which grants him access to 9 rides. This option not only saves him money but also eliminates the need to carry multiple tickets.

To calculate the amount of money David saves, we subtract the cost of his ride bracelet from the total cost of Dasha's individual tickets: $36 - $30 = $6.

Therefore, David saves $6 by opting for the ride bracelet over individual tickets.

"When considering the shift from traditional cable to streaming services, it's essential to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the new options. In this case, Tim decides to cancel his $60 cable package and opt for streaming services.

He chooses Netflix for $10 a month. For the other two services, Hulu and Disney Plus, he bundles them together, which normally costs $10 each, totaling $20. However, by bundling, he saves 20% on the combined cost.

To calculate the savings, we need to find 20% of the $20 bundled cost. This is calculated as 0.2 * $20 = $4. 

By saving $4 on the bundled cost, the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

Adding the cost of Netflix, the total monthly cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Comparing this to the original $60 cable package, Tim saves $60 - $26 = $34 by making the switch.

"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner before and after the reduction in usage.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since Mel uses it for 8 hours a day, the original energy used per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the new energy used per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh.

The energy saved per day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

"To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we need to calculate the initial and additional quantities of each.

Allan initially has twice as many corns as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

When Allan bought more cannolis and corns, he bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought: 
Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 20
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100

"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he completed before his jog. 

Elliott finished half of his daily goal of 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. Half of 10,000 is 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To determine how early Toby will be at the airport, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's calculate the total time it will take Toby to read the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and it averages 200 words per page, we can find the total number of words in the book by multiplying the number of pages by the number of words per page: 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words.

Next, we can find the time it will take Toby to read the book by dividing the total number of words by his reading rate of 300 words per minute: 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes.

After reading the book, Toby will need 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time it will take him to read the book and travel to the airport is 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we can find out how many minutes early he will be by subtracting the time he arrives from the time he has to be there: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wages.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, resulting in a total of 160 hours per employee. With an hourly wage of $15, the total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, leaving 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, resulting in a total of 160 hours per employee. With an hourly wage of $15, the total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased during her vacation.

First, let's consider the taffy. The sale is structured as ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This implies that the second pound of taffy is half off, which means it costs $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the mixed bag of seashells, which is $1.50. Additionally, the 4 magnets cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items Sally bought: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally initially had $10. After purchasing the items, she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

The final answer is: $3"
"When it comes to managing finances, especially during festive occasions like the fourth of July, it's essential to keep track of expenses. Let's break down the costs associated with Tim's fireworks purchase.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package is twice that amount, which is $800. Therefore, the total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

However, Tim receives a 20% discount on the fireworks. To calculate the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.2, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240. This means the discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

In addition to the fireworks, Tim also purchases a finale firework for $150.

To find the total amount spent, we add the discounted cost of the fireworks to the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate her daily cookie consumption and then multiply it by the number of days she wants the cookies to last.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night. To find out her daily consumption, we multiply this by the number of nights in 30 days:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the intersection of two conditions: being more dangerous and having a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, let's find the number of candles that are more dangerous. Since Marcy guarantees that 99% of her candles are safe, 1% are more dangerous. This means 1% of 50,000 candles are at risk of exploding. 

1% of 50,000 is 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are both more dangerous and smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles have this defect, we multiply 500 by 5% (or 0.05).

0.05 * 500 = 25 candles.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more likely to explode is 25."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

First, we find the discount amount, which is 30% of the regular price. The regular price of each blouse is $20. 

30% of $20 is calculated as 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price of each blouse: $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price by 4 to find the total cost: 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's call the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To determine the number of dromedaries in the herd, we need to consider the number of humps. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can use this information to set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. The total number of heads in the herd is 180, which gives us the equation:

C + D = 180

The total number of bumps (humps) in the herd is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write another equation:

2C + D = 304

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the number of dromedaries. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, the number of dromedaries in the herd is 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To determine the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the journey into manageable segments and calculate the distance traveled in each part.

First, let's consider the initial four days of the trip. During this period, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. Therefore, the total distance covered in the first four days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we need to calculate the distance traveled over the subsequent two days. It's mentioned that he covered only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.30:
(0.30) * 800 km = 240 km
So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 km.

On the following day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance covered is 0 km.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day. Since there are seven days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each segment of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we need to understand the relationships between the lockers. 

Let's start with Peter's locker, which is 5 cubic inches. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can calculate Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. 
4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches (Zack's locker size)

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. To find Timothy's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2. 
2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches (Timothy's locker size)

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's current elevation.

First, let's find the elevation of the comb. Since it fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's initial elevation of 10,000 feet, we subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's elevation.

Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"Let's analyze the situation. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. He then received $4000 from the first bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

To find the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks, we add the amounts from both banks: $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, to determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To determine the number of cats left on the rock, let's break down the information provided.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. This means a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away.

Now, we need to calculate the number of cats remaining on the rock. We subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.

To find the final number of cats left on the rock, we subtract the number of cats that ran from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break it down into the different price periods and calculate the cost for each period.

The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

Next, we're told that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Now, let's substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we get: 3T - 6 = 18.

Adding 6 to both sides, we get: 3T = 24.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

First, let's consider the buses. With 4 buses, each capable of holding 60 employees, the total capacity is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

Next, we'll calculate the capacity of the minibusses. There are 6 minibusses, each holding 30 employees, so the total capacity is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

Lastly, we'll consider the minivans. With 10 minivans, each holding 15 employees, the total capacity is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to consider the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder.

The homemade bird feeders attract 30 birds each, as they are 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which attract 20 birds each. Since Lillian made 3 homemade bird feeders and bought 3 store-bought ones, we can calculate the total number of birds attracted to each type of feeder.

The homemade bird feeders attract a total of 3 * 30 = 90 birds.
The store-bought bird feeders attract a total of 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted to the homemade and store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"When it comes to making healthy food choices, it's essential to be mindful of the nutritional value of each item on the menu. However, in this scenario, we're focusing on the financial aspect of Aleksandra's dinner.

To calculate the total cost, let's break down the prices of each item. The bagel costs $4. The soup is 25% more expensive than the bagel, which means it costs 4 + (4 * 0.25) = $5. On the other hand, the cake is half the price of the bagel, so it costs 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To determine the initial number of Pokémon cards Kenny had, we need to consider the amount of money he has and the price at which he sells the cards. Since Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the amusement park ticket costs $100, he needs to make $50 from selling the cards.

Each card is sold for $1.5, so we can calculate the number of cards he sold by dividing the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5 = 33.33 (round down to 33 since you can't sell a fraction of a card)

However, Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.33

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 Pokémon cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we need to consider the total number of hotdogs prepared and the number of hotdogs required when all 40 guests showed up.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs, and the other half to have one hotdog. This means 18 guests were prepared for two hotdogs, and 18 guests were prepared for one hotdog. 

For the 18 guests who were prepared for two hotdogs, the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs. For the 18 guests who were prepared for one hotdog, the caterer prepared 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, when 40 guests showed up, each guest wanted a second hotdog. This means a total of 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were required. Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough.

Therefore, 26 guests did not receive a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we need to calculate the number of letters in each name and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. Since her name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, we need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. Half of 6 is 3. 

Her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters in both names: 6 (Indras) + 7 (her sister) = 13.

"To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- A set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- A set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- Five separate utensils at $5.00 each will cost 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 20% of the total cost before the discount. To find 20% of $165.00, we multiply $165.00 by 0.20, which equals $33.00.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"

"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to understand the relationships between the dragons slain by each prince.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who is known to have slain 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is 75. 

Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, then slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, used a nail file to slay one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. To find this number, we divide the number of dragons Prince Walter slew by 5: 150 / 5 = 30.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

"To determine how many pints of gasoline Josey needed to run her lawnmower, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8. 

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. 

1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons

Now we convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 0.75 by 8.

0.75 * 8 = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the total amount of money George spent on candy bars. Since he spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money. This means he spent $4.99.

The cost of 3 bags of chips is 3 * 40 cents = $1.20. Therefore, the amount of money George spent on chips is $1.20.

To find the amount of money George spent on candy bars, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount he spent: $4.99 - $1.20 = $3.79.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find the number of candy bars George bought by dividing the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: $3.79 / 0.75 = 5.0533.

Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

"When it comes to sharing treats, it's essential to consider the distribution of sweets among friends. In this scenario, let's break it down.

Ray had 25 lollipops and decided to keep 5 for himself. To find out how many lollipops each of his friends received, we need to determine the number of lollipops he shared.

The number of lollipops shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Since he shared these lollipops equally among 4 friends, we can calculate the number of lollipops each friend received by dividing the total shared lollipops by the number of friends.

20 / 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"When it comes to portion control and cake consumption, it's essential to consider the nutritional value of the cake and the individual's dietary needs. However, in this scenario, we're focusing on the weight of the remaining cake.

To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we need to calculate the weight of the cake that was consumed by Rory and her mom. Since the cake is cut into 8 equal pieces, we can divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces to find the weight of each piece.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we can calculate the total weight of the cake they consumed.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is: 15"

To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people. This calculation is as follows:

Total oranges = 56
Total people = 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends)

Now, let's perform the division:
56 ÷ 8 = 7

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges."
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to consider the cost of the ingredients and the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the cost of the onions. Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he wants to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the total cost of the onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we can calculate the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Therefore, the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to get to the theater first, we need to consider the time it takes for each of them to get to the theater.

Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 - 5 = -1 minutes before Wayne. However, since you can't leave before you start, we need to find the time Bernadette needs to leave after Wayne.

Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, and she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the time Bernadette needs to leave before Wayne, not after. To do this, we need to subtract the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater from the time she needs to leave before Wayne.

So, Bernadette needs to leave 21 - 16 = 5 minutes before Wayne leaves. Since Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 5 + 5 = 10 minutes before Wayne.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. Given that the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we must convert the length to feet.

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we need to calculate the total number of beads each of them has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60

"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the effects of both the oven and the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Next, we need to calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The window is open for 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. Since the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, for 30 minutes, it cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the final temperature of the house. The initial temperature is 40 degrees. Adding the temperature increase due to the oven (15 degrees) and subtracting the temperature decrease due to the open window (6 degrees), we get:

40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees

Therefore, the final temperature of Marcus's house is 49 degrees.

"To determine James' run time, we need to calculate his total time and then subtract the time it took him to swim and bike.

First, let's find James' swim time. Since he finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we need to calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Next, let's find James' bike time. He takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find James' total time. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. Therefore, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find James' run time. We know his total time and his swim and bike times, so we can subtract the swim and bike times from his total time. James' run time is 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"To determine the length of Movie A, we need to break down the given information step by step.

First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Movie C is 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes long.

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

Now, we are told that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we need to divide the length of Movie B by 4. So, Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the amount of hay the horse needs, we must first calculate the distance it runs. Given that the horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time to hours.

30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the distance by multiplying the speed by the time: 32 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse consumes 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will require 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, totaling $30. To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she has. Since she uses 4 dozen eggs from cases, we calculate the total eggs from the cases as 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Additionally, she uses 2 loose eggs from the cupboard. Therefore, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per glass: 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray to find the number of trays: 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

The final answer is: 2"

"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to consider the total revenue generated from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, resulting in a revenue of:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, we determine the revenue from the sale to the department store. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
$340 + $775 = $1115

Now, we subtract the initial cost of the case of sneakers, which was $576, from the total revenue to find the profit:
$1115 - $576 = $539

"To determine the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in the packets with 8 pieces each and the packets with 16 pieces each.

First, let's calculate the number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each: 6 * 8 = 48

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each: 4 * 16 = 64

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112

The total number of crayons Beatrice bought is 112."
"To determine the regular price of popcorn, let's analyze the given information. 

When you buy a super ticket for $20, it includes a movie ticket and a soda and popcorn for $1 extra. If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda and popcorn at their regular prices, you save $2. 

Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as 'x'. Since the soda costs $3, the total cost of buying a regular ticket and a soda and popcorn is $12 + $3 + x = $15 + x.

The super ticket costs $20, which includes the regular ticket price of $12, the soda price of $3, and the extra $1 for the popcorn. This means the total cost of the super ticket is $12 + $3 + $1 = $16. 

However, you save $2 by buying the super ticket instead of the regular ticket and the soda and popcorn. This implies that the cost of the super ticket ($16) is $2 less than the cost of the regular ticket and the soda and popcorn ($15 + x). 

So, we can set up the equation: $16 = $15 + x - $2. 

Simplifying the equation, we get $16 = $13 + x. 

Subtracting $13 from both sides, we get x = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after a price increase, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can set up the equation 20x = 900. 

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45. 

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. 

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65. 

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. Multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11050.

The final answer is: 11050"
"To calculate the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance1 = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles
Distance2 = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles
Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

"When it comes to maintaining a balanced diet, it's essential to consider the daily intake of essential nutrients, including fruits like apples. In this scenario, we have Marin and his neighbor Nancy, both consuming 4 apples a day.

To determine their combined daily apple consumption, we add their individual intakes: 4 apples/day (Marin) + 4 apples/day (Nancy) = 8 apples/day.

Now, let's calculate their total apple consumption over a 30-day period. We multiply their daily intake by the number of days: 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples.

The key takeaway here is that a consistent daily consumption of 8 apples can provide a significant amount of fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, contributing to overall well-being. However, it's crucial to maintain a balanced diet and not overconsume any single food item.

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the total cost of potting soil for Bob's vegetable garden, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for each raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume of one bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags required is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to determine the number of green cards first. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of fairies remaining, let's break down the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn observed 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, her friend noticed half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the existing group. Since half of 50 is 25, 25 new fairies joined the group.

Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 

To find the number of fairies remaining, we subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total: 75 - 30 = 45.

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to calculate the total number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots.

First, let's find the total number of puppies. Jennifer has 8 puppies, and Brandon has 12 puppies. 

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon has 4 puppies with spots.

Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the percentage of puppies with spots is 35%."
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make to transport the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and divide it by the truck's capacity.

First, let's calculate the weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add the weights together to find the total weight of the feed:

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips, we'll divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"As a health expert, I'd like to emphasize the importance of recycling in maintaining a healthy environment. However, let's focus on the financial aspect of Grayson's recycling efforts.

To calculate Grayson's earnings from recycling, we need to consider the value of the materials she recycles. Aluminum cans are worth two cents each, and plastic bottles are worth three cents each.

Grayson consumes three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water per week. 

Aluminum cans: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week
Plastic bottles: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week: 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month

"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we need to understand the relationship between the number of plants each person has. 

First, let's establish the number of plants Frederick has, which is given as 10. 

Next, we need to calculate the number of plants Toni has, who has 60% more plants than Frederick. To do this, we calculate 60% of 10 and add it to 10. 
60% of 10 = 0.6 * 10 = 6
Toni's plants = 10 + 6 = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. 
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To determine the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we need to consider the relationship between the carrot sticks and the cookies. According to Matt's dad, he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This means that the number of cookies is directly proportional to the number of carrot sticks, with a constant of proportionality of 1/2.

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks as 'x'. The number of cookies can be expressed as (1/2)x + 2. Since Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have the opportunity to eat 5 cookies.

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to calculate the combined length of the remoras and then find the percentage of the shark's body length that this represents.

First, let's convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can divide the length of the remoras by 12 to get their length in feet.

6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, we multiply their length by 2 to get the combined length.

Combined length of remoras = 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

Therefore, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

"To determine the number of books each child received, we need to calculate the total number of books purchased and then divide that number by the number of children.

The total amount spent on books is $300, and each book costs $15. 

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since the books were distributed equally among 4 children, we divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything, we need to consider the total number of kids and the number of kids allergic to dairy, peanuts, or both.

First, let's calculate the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. We can do this by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtracting the number allergic to both to avoid double-counting. This is based on the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts
= 32 - 12
= 20

Each group has 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups, so the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

The total number of people going on the tour is the sum of the employees and the tour guides, which is 600 + 21 = 621.

The final answer is: 621"
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to consider the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for two people is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price of $1500 per day. To find the new price, we calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price to get the new price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we need to calculate three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. 

Three-quarters of 48 grains is (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains.

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

The combined weight of the two pennies is 36 + 48 = 84 grains.

"To determine the difference in the number of songs each person can add to their portable media player, we need to first calculate the number of songs each person currently has. 

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which is 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

The maximum capacity of the player is 100 songs. To find out how many more songs each person can add, we subtract the number of songs they already have from the maximum capacity. Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs, and Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs.

The difference in the number of songs they can add is 80 - 40 = 40.

"To determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate the number of oranges he ate. 

They picked 60 oranges, and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 5.

60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.

24 * $10 = $240

"To determine the total hours James runs in a week, we need to calculate his weekly mileage and then divide it by his running speed.

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. This translates to a weekly mileage of 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Given that James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can calculate the total hours he runs in a week by dividing his weekly mileage by his speed.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

Therefore, James runs 6 hours a week."
"To determine the amount of oats Uncle Ben's horses need, we must consider their daily consumption. Each horse requires 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. This results in a daily consumption of 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per horse.

With four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds of oats. For a five-day period, the total consumption would be 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to calculate how many bags are required to meet this total. To do this, we divide the total consumption by the weight of each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To determine the number of girl Pomeranians Jana has, we need to calculate the total number of Pomeranians first. Since two thirds of her 27 puppies are Pomeranians, we can find this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To find the average highest temperature, we need to consider the extreme temperatures recorded in different regions. 

When analyzing the data, we have -48°F in Southlandia, 21°F in Northlandia, and -3°F in Midlandia. 

First, we add these temperatures together: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Then, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average: -30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of these regions is -10°F."
"To determine how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first. 

The child wants to buy a toy car that costs $12 and already has $4 in savings. 

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount.

Daily savings = $2
Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"When it comes to storing eggs safely, it's essential to consider the capacity of the trays. Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays available. To determine how many eggs won't fit, we need to calculate the total capacity of the trays.

The total capacity of the trays is 24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs.

Jaime has 64 eggs, and the trays can hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we subtract the capacity from the total number of eggs: 64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs.

Therefore, the number of eggs that won't fit on the trays is 16.

The final answer is: 16"

The small pizza costs $8, and the family-size pizza is three times as expensive as the small one. To find the cost of the family-size pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

"When it comes to personal grooming, having the right tools is essential. In this case, Heather is looking to purchase razors that come in packs of 4 for $4.00 each. However, there's a buy one get one free offer in place, which significantly reduces the cost. Additionally, she has a $2.00 coupon to further lower the expense.

To determine the cost per individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon applied. Since the buy one get one free offer is in effect, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors, which is $4.00. With the $2.00 coupon, the total cost is reduced to $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, let's calculate the number of razors in 2 packs: 2 packs * 4 razors per pack = 8 razors.

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

Converting this to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after the discount is 25 cents.

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

"To determine Angela's current age, we need to consider Brett's age and the relationship between their ages in the future. 

Let's start by calculating Brett's age in four years. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

Now, we are told that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. This means that in four years, Angela's age will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

To find Angela's current age, we need to subtract 4 years from her age in four years. Therefore, Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

"To determine the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to consider the cost of his daily rides. 

Paul drives his car twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. The morning ride costs $6, while the afternoon ride costs $2. 

Over a period of 14 days, the total cost of the morning rides would be 14 days * $6 per day = $84. 

Similarly, the total cost of the afternoon rides would be 14 days * $2 per day = $28.

To find the overall expenditure, we add the cost of the morning rides to the cost of the afternoon rides: $84 + $28 = $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"To determine the number of Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has a total of 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by 3.

120 / 3 = 40

Therefore, Brianne and Ashley can make 40 Greek orange pies.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to consider the total expenses for each venue. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, plus an additional $5 per guest for food. The second venue charges $25 per guest, which includes food.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The total cost for the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). The total cost for the second venue is $25x (per person charge).

To find the break-even point, we set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

Therefore, the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects Lily found is B/2 + 7.

The total number of insects collected by all three is 43. We can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for the friends who want 5 gifts each. There are 2 friends, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 2 * 5 = 10.

Next, let's calculate the number of gifts for the friends who want 2 gifts each. There are 3 friends, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 3 * 2 = 6.

Now, we add the number of gifts for both groups of friends: 10 + 6 = 16.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts to get the total number of gifts Cherrie bought: 16 + 10 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine the length of the couch, we need to establish the width of the rug first. Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, we can calculate the rug's width as follows:

Rug's width = Chair's width + 5
Rug's width = 3 + 5
Rug's width = 8 feet

Now, we need to find the length of the couch. It is mentioned that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. 

Twice the width of the rug = 2 * 8
Twice the width of the rug = 16 feet
Couch's length = Twice the width of the rug + 2
Couch's length = 16 + 2
Couch's length = 18 feet

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"When it comes to making healthy choices, it's essential to consider the nutritional value of the products we consume, including gum. However, in this case, we're dealing with a financial puzzle rather than a health concern.

Let's break down the information provided: Suzie bought four packs of gum in total. Two packs are strawberry gum, one pack is grape gum costing $2, and one pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum.

Since the green apple gum costs half as much as the grape gum, its cost is $2 / 2 = $1. The total cost of all the gum is $7.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to consider the total cost of all the gum packs. Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

Since the total cost is $7, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, we need to determine which type of wood provides the most sticks per dollar. 

A 2 x 4 piece of wood yields 200 sticks and costs $4, resulting in 50 sticks per dollar. On the other hand, a 2 x 8 piece of wood yields 400 sticks and costs $6, resulting in 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Given the higher sticks per dollar ratio, the 2 x 8 piece of wood is the most cost-effective option.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will yield 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600.

The final answer is: 1600"
"When it comes to equipping sled dogs for winter activities, snowshoes are an essential investment. Each dog requires a pair of snowshoes to ensure they can move comfortably and safely in snowy conditions. 

To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has four legs, and Mario has six dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Therefore, the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"As a health expert, I'd like to approach this problem from a unique perspective. However, I'll focus on the financial aspect of Janet's bus travel.

Cost of one bus trip: $2.20
Number of trips in a week: 5

Total weekly cost of bus trips: $2.20 * 5 = $11.00

Now, let's consider the cost of a weekly bus pass. 

Weekly bus pass cost: $20

To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we subtract the cost of the bus trips from the cost of the pass.

Amount saved: $20 - $11.00 = $9.00

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo, we need to calculate the number of animals at each location and then add them together.

First, let's consider the number of cows at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows, and the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Therefore, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

Next, we need to determine the number of sheep at the farm and the zoo. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, and she bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

However, this equation is not necessary to solve the problem. We can simply use the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. This means that if Sophia bought x onions and y potatoes, Rose bought 4x onions and 4y potatoes.

We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. This can be represented as:
4x = 12
4y = 4

Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 3
y = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his weight loss goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he must burn. Since it takes approximately 3500 calories to lose one pound, and Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

Next, we need to determine the number of days Andy has to reach his goal. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. To find the number of days, we calculate the difference between these two dates.

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Now, we can calculate the daily calorie deficit by dividing the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5 calories per day.

To maintain a safe and sustainable weight loss, it's essential to create a calorie deficit through a combination of diet and exercise. Aiming for a daily calorie deficit of 613.5 calories will help Andy reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{614}$"
"To determine how much Gerald has left after working for a week and spending $100, we need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, his total earnings for the week would be:
$30/day * 7 days = $210

Now, let's calculate how much he has left after spending $100:
$210 - $100 = $110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink after running, we need to consider the distance she covers and the water intake requirement per kilometer.

First, let's calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since she is running 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, we can find the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap:

8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink. The recommended water intake is 60 ml per kilometer. To find the total water intake, we multiply the total distance by the water intake per kilometer:

2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 120 ml of water after running."
"To determine how much money Julie had left after her purchases, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes. 20% of $500 is equivalent to 0.2 * $500 = $100. After buying clothes, Julie had $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on CDs. 25% of $400 is equivalent to 0.25 * $400 = $100. After buying CDs, Julie had $400 - $100 = $300 left.

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the cost of the house, we need to establish a relationship between the cost of the house and the lot. Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We can express this as an equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000. To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000.

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying the cost of the lot by 3: 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To calculate the profit from selling the canvas bags, we need to consider the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's determine the total cost. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. This means she purchased a total of 8 * 5 = 40 bags. The total cost is then 40 bags * $4 = $160.

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue. She sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is 40 bags * $8 = $320.

Now, let's find the profit. Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, so profit = $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of punches thrown by Joe, we need to consider the duration of the fight and his punching rate.

A standard boxing match consists of 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes. Therefore, the total duration of the fight is 5 rounds * 3 minutes per round = 15 minutes.

Given that Joe throws an average of 25 punches per minute, we can calculate the total number of punches by multiplying his punching rate by the total duration of the fight: 25 punches per minute * 15 minutes = 375 punches.

Therefore, the total number of punches thrown by Joe is 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"To determine the number of cookies Kelsie made, we need to understand the relationship between the number of cookies each person made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies by dividing Suzanne's total by 4.

36 / 4 = 9 cookies made by Josh.

Now, we know Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find Kelsie's total, we multiply Josh's total by 2.

9 * 2 = 18 cookies made by Kelsie.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali initially has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. 

Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

Next, Ali gives his sister half of the total money. Half of the total money is $160 / 2 = $80. Therefore, the money left after giving his sister half is $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner. He uses 3/5 of the remaining money, which is (3/5) * $80 = $48. 

To find the final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we subtract the money used for dinner from the remaining money: $80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine how long it takes Royce to shingle a house, we first need to convert Rob's time from hours to minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we calculate this as 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Now, we know that Royce takes double the time it takes Rob plus 40 minutes. This can be expressed as: Royce's time = (2 * Rob's time) + 40 minutes.

Substituting Rob's time (120 minutes) into the equation, we get: Royce's time = (2 * 120) + 40 = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

Therefore, the time it takes Royce to shingle a house is 280 minutes.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total amount of wool needed for Martha's grandchildren, we need to calculate the wool required for each item and then sum them up.

For hats, it takes 2 skeins of wool per hat, and since there are 3 children, the total wool needed for hats is 3 * 2 = 6 skeins.

For scarves, 4 skeins of wool are required per scarf, and with 3 children, the total wool needed for scarves is 3 * 4 = 12 skeins.

For sweaters, 12 skeins of wool are needed per sweater, and with 3 children, the total wool required for sweaters is 3 * 12 = 36 skeins.

For mittens, 1 skein of wool is required per pair, and with 3 children, the total wool needed for mittens is 3 * 1 = 3 skeins.

For socks, 2 skeins of wool are required per pair, and with 3 children, the total wool needed for socks is 3 * 2 = 6 skeins.

"To determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to consider their combined work rate.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate their work rate as follows: 0.5 house / 5 days = 0.1 house per day.

With 5 people working together, their combined work rate would be 5 times that of one person, which is 0.1 * 5 = 0.5 house per day.

Since they can paint 0.5 house in one day, they can paint a whole house (1 house) in 1 / 0.5 = 2 days.

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To determine the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have, we need to calculate the number of chairs and sofas each of them has.

Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and she has 20 sofas, she must have 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"To determine the number of passengers after the second stop, let's break down the events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Now, let's calculate the number of passengers who get on at the second stop. It's mentioned that 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times the number of passengers who got off (21) fewer passengers get on. 3 times 21 is 63, so 63 fewer passengers get on. However, since we are looking for the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. So, 21 - 63 = -42. Since you can't have a negative number of passengers, this means that 63 more passengers got on.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122.

The final answer is: 122"
"To determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin, we need to establish their current ages and then calculate the difference.

First, let's find Jame's current age. Since he will turn 27 in 5 years, we subtract 5 from 27 to get his current age: 27 - 5 = 22 years.

Next, we need to find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years. Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years. So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 from 55: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we can calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin: 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first determine the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer by subtracting $400 from the cost of the computer.

The cost of the computer is $1,100. Therefore, the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now that we know the cost of the computer and the printer, we can find the total cost of these two items by adding their costs together: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400. To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, we can find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to consider the total number of seashells brought by the boys and the girls.

Since the boys brought 60 seashells each and there are 10 boys, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells more than the boys.

So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 600 + 300 = 900.

To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls, which is 10. Therefore, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 900 / 10 = 90.

"To determine the number of candies Nick has, let's analyze the situation. We know that George had a certain number of candies, and after eating 5, he was left with 3. This means that before eating 5 candies, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, and George had 8 candies, Nick must have had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies."
"To determine Anne's age, we need to calculate Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we subtract 4 from Chenny's age to get Alyana's age.

Chenny is 10 years old, so Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6.

Now, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we add 2 to Alyana's age to get Anne's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book individually.

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we need to calculate the remaining vlogs she needs to create. 

First, let's calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made. In the first week, Emma made 18 vlogs, in the second week she made 21 vlogs, and in the third week, she made 15 vlogs. 

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, let's calculate the remaining vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month:
72 (total vlogs) - 54 (vlogs made so far) = 18

Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her monthly goal.

"When it comes to dining out, it's essential to consider the total cost, including the tip. To calculate the total amount you paid, let's start by determining the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.

20% of $50 is equivalent to 0.20 * $50, which equals $10. 

Now, to find the total amount you paid, we need to add the tip to the original bill.

Total amount = $50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, the total amount you paid for the dinner is $60."
"To determine the eldest boy's current amount of money, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we can calculate his initial share by dividing $18 by 3. This gives us $6.

Next, the eldest boy added $5 to his initial share, bringing his total to $6 + $5 = $11. The following day, he added another $10, increasing his total to $11 + $10 = $21.

However, the eldest boy then spent $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13. To find out how much he has now, we need to consider the fact that he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means we multiply $13 by 3, resulting in $13 * 3 = $39.

Therefore, the eldest boy currently has $39."
"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we need to calculate his daily savings goal for the entire month and then divide it by the number of days in the second half.

First, let's calculate the total amount Elvis needs to save in the month. His monthly saving target is $1125.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, we can assume the number of days in the first half is x. The number of days in the second half will also be x. 

The total number of days in April is 30, so x + x = 30, which simplifies to 2x = 30, and x = 15.

Now, we can calculate the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the first half. The total amount saved in the first half is the total monthly savings divided by the number of days in the first half: 1125 / 15 = 75.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2 * 75 = 150.

The final answer is: $150"
"When it comes to making healthy choices, it's essential to consider the nutritional value of the foods we consume. However, in this scenario, we're dealing with a financial transaction rather than a nutritional analysis.

To determine the change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she purchased. 

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we need to calculate their total earnings based on the tasks they completed.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. 
Jairus' total earnings = 0.8 * 20 = $16

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, and she also finished 20 tasks. 
Jenny's total earnings = 0.5 * 20 = $10

Now, we need to find the difference between Jairus' total earnings and Jenny's total earnings.
Difference = Jairus' total earnings - Jenny's total earnings = 16 - 10 = $6

"When dividing a total amount between two individuals, we can use algebra to determine the individual portions. In this case, let's consider the scenario where Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars.

Let's denote the amount Brad receives as x. Since Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be represented as 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of their shares is 100. This can be expressed as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 20

Now that we know Brad receives 20 dollars, we can calculate Jeff's share by multiplying 4 by x:

Jeff's share = 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars

Therefore, Jeff receives 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"As a health expert, I'd like to emphasize the importance of regular physical activity, such as walking, for maintaining overall well-being. In this case, let's calculate the total miles Jeff walks in a week.

To determine the total miles Jeff walks each day, we need to consider the round trip to and from work. Since his workplace is 3 miles away, the total distance for a round trip is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total miles Jeff walks in a week. Assuming he works 5 days a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 miles.

**Recommendation:** Regular walking can have numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, weight management, and reduced risk of chronic diseases. Encourage Jeff to incorporate physical activity into his daily routine, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator or walking during his lunch break.

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, let's break down the process step by step.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which consists of 26 letters each time. So, she has written 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Then, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is another 65 letters.

To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the last two amounts together: 65 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: 130"
"When analyzing the pattern of a phone tree, it's essential to understand the exponential growth of notifications. In this scenario, we start with 3 families being notified by Ali in the first round. 

In the second round, each of these 3 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified. 

Moving to the third round, each of the 9 families notifies 3 other families, leading to 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified.

To find the number of families notified in the fourth round, we apply the same pattern. Each of the 27 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families being notified.

Therefore, in the fourth round of calls, a total of 81 families will be notified.

"To determine Mark's initial weight, we need to consider the weight loss over the 3-month period. Since he lost 10 pounds per month, the total weight lost would be 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.

To find Mark's initial weight, we simply add the total weight lost to his final weight. 

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first calculate the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we can find the total by multiplying 80 by 5.

80 * 5 = 400

Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"To determine the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item first.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is 1 * $12 = $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is 1 * $10 = $10.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

However, the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1: 0.1 * $30 = $3.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the initial $1000 and the remaining amount.

The commission for the initial $1000 is 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For the sales over $1000, we need to calculate the additional commission. The amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500. The additional commission for this amount is 10% of $1500, which is 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Now, we add the commission for the initial $1000 and the additional commission for the sales over $1000 to get the total commission. $300 + $150 = $450.

The total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"To determine the number of water bottles Bill needs for his party, we must first calculate the total number of bottles required. Since he wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest: 70 x 2 = 140 bottles.

Next, we need to consider the bottles Bill already has. He started with 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. So, he has a total of 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

To find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles required: 140 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 92 bottles.

Therefore, Bill needs to purchase 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

"When analyzing an individual's swimming performance, it's essential to consider the impact of water temperature on their speed. In this case, we have a person named Ray, and we're comparing his swimming times in cold and warm water.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. On the other hand, when the water is warm, he takes 2 minutes more than twice as long to complete the same distance. To determine his swimming time in warm water, we need to calculate twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water and add 2 minutes to it.

Twice the time in cold water = 2 * 16 = 32 minutes
Time in warm water = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

Time to swim 3 miles in cold water = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes
Time to swim 3 miles in warm water = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time between the two conditions, we subtract the time in cold water from the time in warm water.

Difference in time = Time to swim 3 miles in warm water - Time to swim 3 miles in cold water
= 102 - 48

"To determine how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to first establish his current coffee consumption. 

Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake. 

Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. 
Octavia drinks 4/2 = 2 cups of coffee.
Juan drinks 10 * 2 = 20 cups of coffee.

However, Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find the reduction, we subtract the recommended intake from his current intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."

The total weight of the three friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by 3: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To determine the final angle from the ground to the sun, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the sun's movement. 

The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. As the sun moves, it rises at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. If it moves for 10 hours, we can calculate the total angle it rises by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours.

Angle moved by the sun = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Now, we add the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle the sun has moved to find the final angle from the ground to the sun.

Final angle from the ground to the sun = Initial angle + Angle moved by the sun
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

"To determine Judy's total reading in two weeks, we need to calculate her reading in both weeks. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. With 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"When it comes to understanding the consumption of sandwiches, it's essential to consider the portion sizes and the number of individuals involved. In this scenario, we have two individuals, Cody and Trevor, who initially shared 12 sandwiches.

To determine the number of sandwiches Cody consumed, we need to calculate a third of the total sandwiches. A third of 12 is 12 divided by 3, which equals 4 sandwiches.

Next, we calculate the number of sandwiches Trevor ate by determining a quarter of the total sandwiches. A quarter of 12 is 12 divided by 4, which equals 3 sandwiches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sandwiches consumed by both Cody and Trevor. This is simply the sum of their individual portions: 4 (Cody's portion) + 3 (Trevor's portion) = 7 sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total consumed from the initial amount: 12 (initial sandwiches) - 7 (consumed sandwiches) = 5 sandwiches.

Therefore, there are 5 sandwiches left.

For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left a standard $5.00, which is a common amount for the initial tooth loss.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, totaling $3.00. This is a straightforward payment for the subsequent teeth.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's calculate the total amount: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The tooth fairy's total payment to Sharon is $9.00."
"To determine the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we need to calculate the goals scored by each of them. 

Let's start by identifying the number of goals scored by each teenager. We know that Richie scored 80 goals. 

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can calculate Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from Richie's total: 80 - 20 = 60 goals.

Similarly, since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can calculate Anna's goals by subtracting 45 from Richie's total: 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Now, let's add up the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The total cost associated with Leah's new kitten is $308."
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. The total number of roses ordered per week is: 
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

"To calculate the net profit of the food truck, we need to consider the costs and revenue associated with selling grilled cheeses.

First, let's break down the costs. The bread costs $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich.

Next, we need to consider the cost of cheese and condiments. The food truck spends $30.00 on cheese and condiments for every 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need to buy one set of cheese and condiments, which costs $30.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is 10 sandwiches * $0.30 per sandwich = $3.00. Adding the cost of cheese and condiments, the total cost is $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00.

On the other hand, the total revenue is the amount earned from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each. Therefore, the total revenue is 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine how much money Kate can make from selling her muffin crayons, we need to calculate the total number of muffin crayons she can create and then multiply that number by the price of each muffin crayon.

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, so the total number of crayons is 3 * 64 = 192.

Next, we need to find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make. Since she melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin crayon, the total number of muffin crayons she can make is 192 / 8 = 24.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Kate can make. Each muffin crayon sells for $1.50, so the total amount of money Kate can make is 24 * $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom, we need to consider the area of the room, the cost of materials, and the cost of labor.

First, let's calculate the area of the room. The room measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of the materials is $2592 + $432 + $864 = $3888.

The total cost of the labor is $864 + $7344 = $8208.

The total cost to replace the carpet is $3888 + $8208 = $12196.

The final answer is: $12196"
"To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to consider the total number of birds he observed over the week and divide it by the number of days.

Let's break down the number of birds Mack saw each day:

- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Now, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw over the week:
50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can now calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day:
280 / 7 = 40

Therefore, the average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

First, we start with a number train value of 20. 

Next, we calculate half of this value, which is 20 / 2 = 10.

Then, we add the starting value to half the number, resulting in 20 + 10 = 30.

After that, we divide the sum by 5, giving us 30 / 5 = 6.

Finally, we multiply the result by the starting value minus 12, which is 20 - 12 = 8. So, we have 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To determine the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together, we need to calculate the number of cards each of them has and then add them together.

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy and his brother have together: 5 + 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the correct oven temperature setting, we need to understand the discrepancy between the set and actual temperatures. The oven is off by a consistent percentage, which we can calculate by finding the difference between the set and actual temperatures, and then dividing by the set temperature.

The difference between the set and actual temperatures is 18 degrees. To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we divide this difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100.

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the actual temperature for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, taking into account the 4% discrepancy. To do this, we calculate 4% of 520 and add it to 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8

The actual temperature for the recipe is 520 + 20.8 = 540.8

However, since Maggie can't set the oven to a fraction of a degree, we need to round to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are looking for the temperature she should set the oven to, not the actual temperature.

To find the temperature she should set the oven to, we need to subtract the percentage by which the oven is off from the actual temperature. 

The temperature she should set the oven to is 520 - 20.8 = 499.2

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature she should set the oven to is 499.

The final answer is: 499"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1 hour to 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives us 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To determine the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

Herb's house price is $76,000. To find 30% of this amount, we multiply it by 0.3. 
0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800

Now, we subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price.
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

The value of Juan's house is $53,200. To find the combined value of the two houses, we add Herb's house price and Juan's house price together.
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To determine the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we need to calculate the number of cups and dishes each of them brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is equivalent to 12 cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she purchased 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought: 
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Total Judy brought: 12 + 24 = 36

Next, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought: 
Friend's cups: 40
Friend's dishes: 44
Total friend brought: 40 + 44 = 84

To find the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend, we add the total number of cups and dishes each of them brought: 
Total Judy brought: 36
Total friend brought: 84
Total brought by both: 36 + 84 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the cost per pair of contact lenses, we need to consider the total number of pairs Pete will have and the total cost of the lenses.

First, let's calculate the number of pairs of contact lenses Pete will use per day. Since 90 single-use contact lenses last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contact lenses he uses per day by dividing the total number of lenses by the number of days they last:

90 lenses / 45 days = 2 lenses per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of:
2 boxes * 90 lenses/box = 180 lenses

The total number of days the contact lenses will last is:
180 lenses / 2 lenses/day = 90 days

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the contact lenses. Each box costs $100, and there is a 10% discount. The discount amount is:
$100 * 0.10 = $10
The total cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is:
$100 * 2 - $10 = $190

To find the cost per pair of contact lenses, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:
$190 / 180 pairs = $1.06 per pair

The final answer is: $1.06"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings based on their work hours and hourly wage.

Jill worked a total of 3 hours, with 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. Her hourly wage is $10. Therefore, her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the amount of water Hannah needs to drink after her workout, we need to calculate the total calories she burns during the activities. 

Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour, and she spends 2 hours doing it, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories. Running burns 600 calories per hour, and she spends 1 hour doing it, so the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units there are. 1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 to find the total amount of water she needs to drink. 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (since it's 1% fewer), and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B (since it's 1% more).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms to get 3.01B = 4500. Now, divide both sides by 3.01 to find the value of B.

B = 4500 / 3.01
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average typing speed of Jared, we need to calculate the average of his three measurements. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, his typing speed increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, his new typing speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, let's add up all the measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The average typing speed of Jared is 52 WPM.

The final answer is: 52"
"When it comes to weight management, the foods we consume play a significant role. In this case, we're comparing the effects of eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast on a daily basis.

Eating Cheerios daily results in a weight loss of 1.25 pounds per week, while consuming donuts daily leads to a weight gain of 1.75 pounds per week. 

To determine the difference in weight after 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option. 

Weight lost per week: -1.25 pounds
Weight gained per week: 1.75 pounds

Weight change after 5 weeks:
-1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds (lost)
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds (gained)

The difference in weight between the two options after 5 weeks is 15 pounds.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we must consider the chain of invitations and the additional guests brought by her friends.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, resulting in a total of 100 + (100 * 2) = 300 people.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them bring their spouses, adding 18 more people to the guest list.

To find the total number of people attending, we sum the two groups: 300 (from the email invitations) + 18 (from Alex's friends) = 318.

However, this count does not account for Alex herself. To accurately determine the number of seats needed, we must add 1 to the total, making it 318 + 1 = 319.

Therefore, Alex will need 319 seats for the event."
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weight of the Papillon first, as the Mastiff's weight is directly related to it.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, who weighs 10 pounds. Therefore, the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon's weight is one-fourth of the Dachshund's weight, which is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the Mastiff's weight by multiplying the Papillon's weight by 44. The Mastiff's weight is 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"When comparing the cost of a pair of boots on Amazon and eBay, it's essential to consider the total cost, including shipping. On Amazon, the boots cost $16, and shipping adds an additional $4, totaling $20.

On eBay, the boots are priced at $13, but shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $8. Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To determine the difference in cost, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to reach Mark's window, we need to consider its growth pattern. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day.

Let's analyze its growth:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since the beanstalk reaches 32 feet on the fourth day, which is taller than Mark's window at 20 feet, we can conclude that it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to reach Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the amount of protein John gets from eating mushrooms, we need to calculate the protein content in the amount he consumes daily and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms. 

The protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms is 3% (3 grams / 100 grams). Now, we can find the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms by multiplying the weight by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's analyze the situation. We're given that Jerry's current age is unknown, but we know that he is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be represented by the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Where 'x' is Jerry's current age.

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the procedure and subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each dental implant is $2000. Since George needs 2 implants, the total base price is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

Additionally, he wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. Therefore, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600. To find the remaining amount he needs to pay, we subtract the deposit from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we need to calculate how many hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount. His hourly wage is $15. To find the number of hours, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to pay for his dental work.

The final answer is: 260"
"In the realm of geometry, we often find ourselves dealing with the properties of triangles. One fundamental property is that the sum of the three angles in a triangle always equals 180 degrees. 

Let's consider a triangle with three angles, where one angle is twice the smallest angle, and another angle is three times the smallest angle. We can denote the smallest angle as x.

Given this information, we can express the other two angles in terms of x: one angle is 2x, and the other angle is 3x.

Now, we can write an equation to represent the sum of the three angles: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combining like terms, we get 6x = 180.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can determine the other two angles. One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees, and the other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

In this triangle, the largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
Next, we'll convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
Then, we'll convert the nickels to cents: 14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
Lastly, we'll convert the pennies to cents: 15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball

"To determine the time it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles, we need to calculate its speed. 

Speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. In this case, the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this speed to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

"To determine the total amount of chocolate pounds made by Ruiz and Marissa in a day, we need to calculate their individual production rates and then sum them up.

First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. Since he can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, we divide 120 by 2 to get his hourly production rate: 60 pounds per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. Since she makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour, we multiply Ruiz's hourly production rate by 3/4: (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now that we have their individual hourly production rates, we can calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they make together in 12 hours. Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates. Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

To find the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together, we add their individual production amounts: 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"

On Monday, Howard spent $8 at the arcade. On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16. On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

To find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade, we need to consider the sales from two different time periods.

In the first four hours, Patrick sold lemonade at a rate of 15 cups per hour for $0.50 per cup. This means he sold a total of 60 cups of lemonade, generating $30 in revenue.

In the subsequent two hours, Patrick sold lemonade at a rate of 10 cups per hour for $0.60 per cup. This translates to 20 cups of lemonade sold, resulting in $12 in revenue.

To find the total amount earned, we add the revenue from both periods: $30 + $12 = $42.

"To determine the lifespan of a tire, we need to consider the total number of rotations it can undergo before needing replacement. Given that a car's tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per mile.

Rotations per mile = 725 rotations / 2 miles
Rotations per mile = 362.5 rotations/mile

Now, let's calculate the total rotations the tires can handle in a month, considering Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 362.5 rotations/mile
Rotations per month = 145,000 rotations/month

To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total allowed rotations by the rotations per month.

Total rotations allowed = 10,440,000 rotations
Rotations per month = 145,000 rotations/month

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 145,000
Months before replacement = 72

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 72 / 12
Years before replacement = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the cost per pump of the shampoo, we need to consider the total number of washes it can provide and the total cost of the shampoo. The bottle is designed to provide 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. If Jackie uses only 1 pump per wash, we need to calculate the total number of pumps in the bottle.

Since the shampoo is meant to be used with 2 pumps per wash, and there are 120 washes, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

Therefore, each pump of the shampoo costs 10 cents."
"To determine how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price of $25. 
Discount = 0.3 * $25 = $7.5

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt:
Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - $7.5 = $17.5

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
Total cost = Discounted price of the shirt + Price of the shorts
Total cost = $17.5 + $35 = $52.5

Since the total cost is $52.5 and Joe has $50, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount Joe has:
Amount left = $50 - $52.5 = -$2.5

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.5"
"To determine the amount of butter needed to make croissants, we need to consider the total number of croissants Juan wants to produce and the amount of butter required per dozen.

Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants per day for a week, which is equivalent to 7 days. Therefore, the total number of croissants is calculated as follows:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, the total number of croissants is:
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

To make 1 dozen croissants, 1/4 pound of butter is required. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Therefore, the total amount of butter required to make 336 croissants is 84 pounds.

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the cost difference in repaving two streets, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference between the two costs.

150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100

Next, we'll calculate the cost of repaving Lewis' 490-meter street at $194 per meter: 
490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060

Now, we'll find the difference in cost between repaving Lewis' and Monica's streets: 
$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To determine the total cost of John's cancer research, we need to consider the initial funding and the increased funding for the extended duration of the project.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000. This is a crucial starting point for the research.

However, the project took 10 times longer than initially anticipated, which means it lasted for 10 * 5 = 50 months. The initial 5 months are already accounted for, so we need to calculate the cost for the remaining 45 months.

For the remaining 45 months, the funding increased by 50% compared to the initial funding. This means the monthly funding is $100,000 + (50% of $100,000) = $150,000.

To find the total cost for the remaining 45 months, we multiply the increased monthly funding by the number of months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Now, we add the cost for the initial 5 months to the cost for the remaining 45 months to get the total cost of the research: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The total cost of John's cancer research is $6,850,000."
"When analyzing the dietary intake of a basketball team at a steakhouse, it's essential to consider the nutritional content of their meals. 

The first player consumed a 6-ounce steak, which is a significant source of protein and saturated fat. The second player's beef tips, consisting of 8 one-ounce portions, also contribute to the overall meat intake. 

The third player's one-pound steak, equivalent to 16 ounces, is a substantial amount of meat. 

To calculate the total amount of meat consumed, we need to sum the individual portions: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

The total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To determine the total number of posts in a Reddit group, we need to consider the daily posting activity of its members. 

First, let's calculate the total number of posts per day. With 1000 members posting an average of 3 posts per day, the total daily posts would be 1000 members * 3 posts/member = 3000 posts/day.

Since March has 31 days, we can find the total number of posts in March by multiplying the daily posts by the number of days: 3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93,000 posts.

Therefore, the total number of posts in the Reddit group for March is 93,000.

"To determine the annual cost of water for laundry, we need to consider Gary's laundry frequency and the water usage per load. Since Gary does laundry twice a week, we calculate the total number of loads in a year by multiplying the weekly frequency by the number of weeks in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year.

Each load of laundry requires 20 gallons of water. Therefore, the total water usage in a year is 104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year.

Given that a gallon of water costs $0.15, we can calculate the annual cost of water for laundry by multiplying the total water usage by the cost per gallon: 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year.

The final answer is: $312"
"To calculate the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to consider the costs of all the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each will be 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to consider the amount of meat he sells daily and the total weight of the bull's meat.

Prince works 10 hours a day and sells 15kg of meat per hour. Therefore, he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

The bull weighs 750kg. To find out how many days it will take to sell the meat, we divide the total weight of the bull's meat by the amount of meat Prince sells per day: 750 / 150 = 5.

This means it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to calculate the total number of seats and then find the number of students.

First, let's find the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row.

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Now, let's find the number of seats occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the total seats were occupied by the administrators.

Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

The remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the parents, we need to find one-third of the remaining seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats
Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Now, we can find the number of seats occupied by the students by subtracting the number of parents from the remaining seats.

Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, let's break down his gum usage.

First, we need to calculate how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate this as follows:

8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces

In addition to the gum he chews at school, Jim also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. This adds up to 2 more pieces.

Total pieces chewed so far: 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces

Now, let's calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim has left. He started with 20 pieces, so we subtract the pieces he's already chewed:

20 (initial pieces) - 6 (pieces chewed) = 14 pieces

However, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find out how many pieces he gives her, we divide the remaining gum by 2:

14 / 2 = 7 pieces

Since Jim gives his sister 7 pieces, we subtract this from the remaining gum:

14 - 7 = 7

Therefore, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we need to calculate her current age first. Since she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can find her current age by subtracting 12 from 16.

Current age = 16 - 12 = 4

Now, we add 4 to her current age to find out how old she will be 4 years from now:
Age 4 years from now = 4 + 4 = 8

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we need to calculate the company's cost to acquire the cars, which is 30% of the total cost. This is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

Now, we can calculate the profit from selling the cars by subtracting the company's cost from the total revenue: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, we need to calculate James' commission on the profit, which is 10% of the profit: 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, we can find this by multiplying the total number of riders by 0.25.

Total riders: 100
Riders who can stay upright: 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of riders who can stay upright by 0.6.

Riders who can stay upright: 25
Women who can stay upright: 25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we can find the number of men who can stay upright by subtracting the number of women who can stay upright from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the prices of the gold and silver jewels in relation to the diamond jewel.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of the diamond jewel. To find this, we multiply the price of the diamond jewel by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Now, we know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. We can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

To find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels together:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"

"To determine how long it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider their relative speed and the distance between them.

The relative speed is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.

This means that Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

The distance between them is 75 miles.

To find the time it will take for Tom to catch up, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative Speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of fish Tommy caught, we need to understand the relationship between the number of fish caught by each person. 

Let's start with Naomi, who caught 17 fish. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's total: 17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find Tommy's total, we add 3 to Darren's catch: 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to consider the total cost of the classes and the maximum cost per class his parents are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total. If the cost per class exceeds $10, his parents will not sign him up again.

Let's calculate the cost per class: 

Cost per class = Total cost of classes / Number of classes
Cost per class = $60 / 10
Cost per class = $6

Since Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

To do this, we can set up an equation where x represents the number of classes attended at $6 per class and y represents the number of classes attended at $10 per class.

6x + 10y = 60

We want to find the maximum whole number of classes Manny can attend at $6 per class. Let's try different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to calculate their individual daily and weekly customer processing rates.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, so her daily production is 50 * 2 = 100 customers. Therefore, Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To determine the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to calculate the cost of each separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of 5 apples. Since 4 apples cost $5.20, we can calculate the cost of 1 apple by dividing $5.20 by 4. 
Cost of 1 apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30
Now, we multiply the cost of 1 apple by 5 to find the cost of 5 apples.
Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50

Next, let's find the cost of 5 oranges. Since 3 oranges cost $3.30, we can calculate the cost of 1 orange by dividing $3.30 by 3.
Cost of 1 orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10
Now, we multiply the cost of 1 orange by 5 to find the cost of 5 oranges.
Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

"To determine the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole first. The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole, is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can now calculate the total time it will take him to dig the hole by multiplying the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To determine Tim's total annual income after the promotion, we need to consider the 5% raise on his monthly salary and the bonus he receives.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary. This is equivalent to 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. Therefore, his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

Next, we calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary. This is $20,000 / 2 = $10,000.

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income by adding the new monthly salary and the bonus: $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

To find the total annual income, we multiply the total monthly income by 12: $31,000 * 12 = $372,000.

"To calculate the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we need to consider the individual costs of each item.

First, let's determine the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the dress pants. Since the dress pants cost 1/5 the cost of a suit, we can find the cost of one dress pant by multiplying the cost of a suit by 1/5. This gives us $750 * 1/5 = $150 per dress pant. With 10 dress pants, the total cost is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's consider the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and each shirt costs $60. Since he buys 10 suits, the total number of dress shirts is 10 * 3 = 30. The total cost of the dress shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we add up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

"When it comes to digging a well, it's essential to consider the varying rates at which one can dig through different materials. In this case, Bill can dig through soil at a rate of 4 feet per hour and clay at half that rate, which is 2 feet per hour.

To calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil, we divide the total depth of the soil by the rate at which Bill can dig through it: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to find the total time: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

The final answer is: 10"
"When it comes to indulging in sweet treats like cupcakes, moderation is key. However, if you're looking to satisfy the cravings of a whole class, let's break down the math.

To determine the total number of cupcakes needed, we need to consider the total number of people involved. This includes the individual buying the cupcakes (Howie), his teacher, and his classmates.

Assuming there are 25 classmates, the total number of people would be:
1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27

Since each person will receive two cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate), we multiply the total number of people by 2:
27 * 2 = 54

Therefore, to satisfy the sweet tooth of everyone in the class, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the total number of likes Fishio received on her Instagram post, let's break down the information provided.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo. Three weeks later, the number of likes increased to 70 times the initial number of likes. This means the number of likes after 3 weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140000.

However, we are not given the number of likes received in the 3 weeks between the initial and the 70 times increase. Instead, we are told that she received 20000 more new likes recently. To find the total number of likes after the 20000 new likes, we need to determine the number of likes before the 20000 new likes were added.

Since the number of likes after 3 weeks is 140000, the number of likes before the 20000 new likes were added is 140000 - 20000 = 120000.

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the total number of likes before the 20000 new likes were added. 

Total likes = 120000 + 20000 = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"When it comes to making informed purchasing decisions, especially when it comes to fresh produce like pomegranates, it's essential to consider the total cost and any potential discounts. Let's break down the scenario.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. However, she received a $2 discount due to a voucher. This brings the total cost down to $398.

The next day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. If Sheila purchased 20 pomegranates at this price, the initial cost would be $600. The 10% discount would then be $60, resulting in a final cost of $540.

To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we subtract the first day's total from the second day's total: $540 - $398 = $142.

The final answer is: $142"
"To calculate the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to determine her sales from both months. 

Let's start by finding the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation: x/2 = $400, where x is the total sales from green hats. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = $400 * 2 = $800.

So, in the first month, Ariadne's total sales from green hats were $800 and from red hats were $400. The total sales in the first month are $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To calculate the total cost of hiring a horse-drawn carriage, we need to consider the time frame and the pricing structure. James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he received 1 hour of free service, so he only paid for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is $30. 

To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the first hour to the cost of the two remaining hours. 

Cost of the first hour: $15
Cost of the second hour: $30
Cost of the third hour: $30

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $30 = $75

Expected wage: $300
Initial amount in the account: $200
Expected total: $300 + $200 = $500

Since she actually has $420 in her account, we can find the difference between the expected total and the actual amount to determine how much was withheld.

Actual amount: $420
Expected total: $500
Withheld amount: $500 - $420 = $80

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs for her party, we need to consider the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat and the number of guests attending. 

Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since each egg yields 2 deviled egg halves, we need to calculate the total number of eggs required.

Number of deviled egg halves needed: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs, we'll divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen.

Number of eggs needed: 24
Number of eggs in a dozen: 12
Number of dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozen eggs for her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we need to calculate the portion of the paper that remains. Since she has already completed 1/3 of the paper, we can find the remaining portion by subtracting the completed portion from the total.

The total number of pages in the paper is 15. To find the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can calculate 2/3 of the total pages, as the remaining portion is 2/3 of the total.

2/3 of 15 = (2/3) * 15 = 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to consider his reading pace. If he plans to read 10 pages a day, we can calculate the number of days it will take him to finish the 200-page book.

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can find the number of days before the deadline by subtracting the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish the book
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining a plane, we need to consider the initial purchase price, monthly hanger rental, and fuel expenses.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly hanger rental is $5,000. To find the annual hanger rental cost, we multiply this by 12: $5,000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $10,000. To find the annual fuel cost, we multiply this by 12: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add the initial purchase price, annual hanger rental, and annual fuel cost to find the total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The total cost for the first year is $330,000."
"When it comes to meal preparation, understanding cooking times for various ingredients is crucial for maintaining a balanced diet and ensuring food safety. In this case, we're dealing with rice, beans, and pork.

Let's break down the cooking times for each ingredient:

1. Rice typically takes around 30 minutes to cook.
2. Pork, being a protein-rich food, requires a longer cooking time. In this scenario, it takes 20 minutes more than rice to cook, which translates to 50 minutes.
3. Beans, being a legume, have a unique cooking requirement. They take half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 80 minutes (30 minutes for rice + 50 minutes for pork). Half of 80 minutes is 40 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total cooking time for all three ingredients:

- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

To ensure optimal nutrition and food safety, it's essential to cook all ingredients thoroughly. In this case, the total cooking time for rice, beans, and pork is 120 minutes.

"When it comes to comparing the cost of different mixtures of almonds and walnuts, it's essential to consider the nutritional benefits of each nut. Both almonds and walnuts are rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber, making them a nutritious addition to a balanced diet.

To calculate the cost of each mixture, we need to consider the cost of almonds and walnuts separately. A pound of almonds costs $10, while a pound of walnuts costs $15.

For the first mixture, which consists of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we can calculate the cost as follows:
- Cost of almonds: 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture, which consists of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we can calculate the cost as follows:
- Cost of almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, let's compare the cost of the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
Difference = $10 - $7
Difference = $3

Therefore, the cost of the first mixture is $3 more than the cost of the second mixture.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs and heads of the animals on Lee's farm. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4S + 2G = 70.

Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, the total number of heads can be represented as S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"When it comes to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, it's essential to prioritize a balanced diet and regular exercise. However, let's focus on the daily essentials, like coffee and donuts. 

A normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but since Roger's favorite brand was sold out, he opted for a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. To calculate the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to find 20% of $5.

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and he needs a week's worth, which is 7 pounds. The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

In addition to the coffee, Roger also bought a donut for $2.

To maintain a healthy lifestyle, it's essential to consume donuts in moderation. However, if you're looking for a quick energy boost, a donut can be a suitable option.

The total cost of Roger's coffee and donut is $42 + $2 = $44.

"Analyzing Christina's mood patterns, we can see that her first 8 days were good, followed by 8 bad days, and then 8 neutral days. This pattern suggests a cyclical nature to her mood, but it's essential to consider the additional information provided.

The next 3 days are reported as good, neutral, and good. To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to consider the total number of good days Christina had. Since we know that the first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good, we can calculate the remaining good days.

There are 30 days in total, and we've already accounted for 8 + 3 = 11 good days. To find the number of good days left, we subtract the known good days from the total number of good days, which is 12.

12 (total good days) - 11 (known good days) = 1

However, this is not the correct answer because we know that Christina had 12 good days in total. The correct approach is to subtract the known good days from the total number of days and then add the remaining good days to the known good days.

30 (total days) - 8 (bad days) - 8 (neutral days) = 14 days left
14 days left - 3 (known days) = 11 days left

"To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to consider its growth rate. Given that it grows 30 inches a day, we can calculate the time it takes to reach the desired height.

First, let's establish the current height of the bamboo in inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 20 feet to inches:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we can divide the difference by the growth rate:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"When it comes to elevator safety, it's essential to consider the weight capacity of the elevator to prevent accidents. In this scenario, we have 9 adults, each weighing an average of 80 kg. 

To calculate the total weight of the 9 adults, we multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults.

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight of the 9 adults.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

Therefore, the total weight of the 9 adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

The Cookie Monster has 12 less cookies than Max, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we add up the number of cookies each person has: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298

The total number of cookies is 298."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the total added length. The dress was extended by 50% of its original length and then 20cm was added. Let's call the original length 'x'. 

The extension is 50% of x, which is 0.5x. Adding 20cm to this extension gives us 0.5x + 20.

The final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: x + (0.5x + 20) = 140.

Combine like terms: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120.

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

The original length of the dress is 80cm."
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to consider the time it took for each mode and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it took for each mode. The time in turtle mode is 60 minutes, and the time in rabbit mode is 40 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the remaining time after reaching the fire station. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to get to the fire station. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. So, the total time to get to the fire station is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have to get to school. Total time they have = 30 minutes, Time to get to the fire station = 19 minutes.

Time left to get to school = Total time they have - Time to get to the fire station
Time left to get to school = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left to get to school = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to get to school without being late.

The final answer is: 11"
"When it comes to grocery shopping, it's essential to be mindful of the total cost of the items we purchase. Let's break down Catherine's shopping list.

She buys 1 kilo of apples for $4, which is a great source of fiber and antioxidants. Then, she purchases 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, providing her with a good dose of potassium and vitamins. Lastly, she buys 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo, which are rich in vitamin C and flavonoids.

To calculate the total cost, we need to add the costs of each item together. The cost of the apples is $4, the bananas are 2 * $2 = $4, and the oranges are 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"When it comes to baking and consuming cookies, it's essential to maintain a balance between indulgence and moderation. In this scenario, Greta and Celinda baked a total of 30 + 60 cookies, which equals 90 cookies.

However, they decided to enjoy 10 of these cookies while they were cooling. This decision is not only a matter of personal preference but also a consideration for their overall health and well-being.

To determine the number of cookies left in the box, we need to subtract the number of cookies consumed from the total number of cookies baked. This calculation yields 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

Therefore, there are 80 cookies left in the box.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

We have two key pieces of information: the sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44, and the older twin is 7 years older than the triplet.

First, let's express the relationship between the older twin and the triplet: T+7 = t+7. This simplifies to T = t.

Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44. Since T = t, we can substitute T for t in the equation: T + (T+7) + T = 44.

Combine like terms: 3T + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3T = 37

Divide by 3: T = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, we need to find the age of one of the twins. The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"
"To determine how much time John has available for a nap, we need to consider the total time he has before dinner and subtract the time he spends on homework.

First, let's convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Next, we'll add up the time John spends on homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time John has available for a nap by subtracting the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap."
"To determine the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to calculate the cost of each item first. 

The cost of 5 lollipops is $2.00, as each lollipop costs $0.40. To find the cost of one candy, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies, which is $3.20. 

The cost of 4 candies is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. Therefore, the cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years of saving, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"When a pet owner brings their dog to the vet, it's essential to consider the various services required for the animal's health and well-being. In this case, the dog needs 2 vaccines, which are typically priced at $20 each, totaling $40. Additionally, a heartworm check is also necessary.

The heartworm check is a crucial diagnostic test that accounts for 60% of the total bill. To determine the total bill, we can represent it as 'x'. The heartworm check can be expressed as 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find the total bill, we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. Subtracting 0.6x from both sides gives us 0.4x = $40.

Dividing both sides by 0.4 yields x = $100. This means the total bill is $100.

The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

Given that the pet owner brought $125 with them, the amount left is $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"When it comes to a balanced diet, incorporating a variety of fruits is essential for maintaining optimal health. A crate of fresh fruit, consisting of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges, can be a great way to meet your daily fruit requirements.

To determine the price of such a crate, we need to consider the cost of each individual fruit. One apple costs $0.5, and since bananas cost twice as much as apples, one banana costs $1. Oranges, being the most expensive, cost three times as much as bananas, which means one orange costs $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

First, let's find the number of blue squares, which is 4 more than the number of red squares. Since there are 14 red squares, there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

Next, we find the number of green squares, which is 6 more than the number of blue squares. So, there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

Finally, we find the number of white squares, which is 12 fewer than the number of green squares. Therefore, there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

The total number of squares is 68. Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To determine the number of chairs Mia's restaurant needs to accommodate the attendees, we must first calculate the total number of chairs required. 

There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Since babies require high chairs, we'll consider them as part of the high chair count. 

Total number of high chairs needed = 15 (babies) + 8 (existing high chairs) = 23

Now, let's calculate the number of regular chairs needed for the adults. 

Number of regular chairs needed = 42 (adults)

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we can find the total number of regular chairs by multiplying the number of high chairs by 5.

Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 (high chairs) = 40

Total number of chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs required.

Number of chairs needed to be added = Total number of chairs needed - Total number of chairs available
= (15 (babies) + 42 (adults)) - 48
= 57 - 48

"To determine the total points collected by the class, we need to calculate the points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 0.3 by 50, which equals 15. Therefore, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. To find 3 times 35, we multiply 3 by 35, which equals 105. Therefore, Martha has 105 points.

The total points collected by the class is 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold of 400 points. Therefore, the class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

First, let's find the cost of the pencils: 6 pencils * $0.50 = $3
Next, we'll find the cost of the erasers: 8 erasers * $0.25 = $2
Now, we add the two amounts together: $3 + $2 = $5

Since you paid $10, the change would be: $10 - $5 = $5

The final answer is: $5"
"To determine the number of people who accept the position at Google, we need to break down the given information step by step.

First, let's consider the initial pool of applicants, which is 100 people. From this pool, 30% receive interviews. 

30% of 100 is calculated as 0.3 * 100 = 30 people receiving interviews.

Next, we need to find out how many of those who received interviews receive a job offer. This is 20% of the 30 people who received interviews.

20% of 30 is calculated as 0.2 * 30 = 6 people receiving a job offer.

Finally, we need to determine how many of those who received a job offer accept the position. This is a third of the 6 people who received a job offer.

A third of 6 is calculated as 6 / 3 = 2 people accepting the position.

Therefore, the number of people who accept the position at Google is 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total amount of rice given to Goldy's cousin and brother, we need to calculate the total number of sacks given away and then multiply it by the weight of each sack.

Goldy gave away a total of 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. 
Total sacks given away = 3 + 4 = 7 sacks

Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we can calculate the total weight of rice given away by multiplying the total sacks by the weight per sack.

Total kilograms given away = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

The final answer is: 175"
"When it comes to a balanced diet, it's essential to consider the types and quantities of food we consume. In this case, let's analyze Castle's cereal purchases.

To determine the difference in cereal boxes between this week and last week, we need to calculate the total number of boxes purchased in each period. This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, totaling 8 boxes.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week: 8 - 4 = 4.

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week.

"To determine the total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the total number of taps for two different scenarios: when her arms are down and when her arms are up.

When Helga's arms are down, she taps her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute and her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute. This results in a total of 550 taps per minute. Over 3 minutes, she would tap a total of 550 * 3 = 1650 times.

When Helga's arms are up, she taps her right and left feet at a rate of 200 taps per minute each. This results in a total of 400 taps per minute. Over 2 minutes, she would tap a total of 400 * 2 = 800 times.

To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we add the total number of taps from both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To determine the financial impact of Ron fixing the pothole, we need to consider the potential damage to his car and the costs associated with fixing it. The pothole has the potential to cause $450 worth of damage to his vehicle.

However, if Ron decides to fix the pothole himself, he will incur a fine of $120 for unauthorized road maintenance. Additionally, he will need to purchase 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each, resulting in a total cost of 3 * $25 = $75.

The total cost of fixing the pothole is the sum of the fine and the cost of the asphalt, which equals $120 + $75 = $195.

To calculate the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

"To determine the total number of chairs left in the restaurant, we need to calculate the remaining chairs after some were sent for repair.

The restaurant initially had 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. 

First, let's find the total number of chairs sent for repair. 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs were sent, so the total number of chairs sent for repair is 20 + 13 = 33.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs left. We subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the initial total number of chairs. 

Total chairs left = Initial normal chairs - Chairs sent for repair (normal) + Initial baby chairs - Chairs sent for repair (baby)
Total chairs left = 170 - 20 + 23 - 13
Total chairs left = 150 + 10
Total chairs left = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To determine the number of slices of pizza left, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by all the individuals. 

First, let's find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 5 people as follows:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

However, we know that 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, so we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 3 people:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we need to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people. Since they ate ¾ of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 2 people as follows:

2 people * 3/4 * 12 slices/person = 2 * 9 = 18 slices

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people by adding the number of slices eaten by the 3 people and the 2 people:

Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Now, we can find the number of slices left by subtracting the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

Total number of slices = 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

However, this is incorrect. We know that 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and 2 people ate 3/4 of their pizzas. Let's recalculate the total number of slices eaten by the 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

"When it comes to understanding the eating habits of our furry friends, it's essential to consider their unique characteristics and abilities. In this case, we're comparing the eating speed of a cat and a dog.

Given that a cat can devour nine sausages in 30 minutes, we need to determine how long it takes for a dog to consume the same amount of food. Since the dog is faster, it will take less time. To calculate this, we'll multiply the time it takes the cat by 2/3.

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, let's find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. This can be calculated by adding their individual times and dividing by 2.

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

Therefore, the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot equals 12 inches, so 8 feet equals 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding 4 inches to that gives us 96 + 4 = 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

To calculate the total number of windows smashed, we need to consider the number of windows from students' and teachers' cars separately.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each.
- A quarter of the students' cars' windows were smashed, which is equivalent to 1/4 * 64 * 4 = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each.
- Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows were smashed, which is equivalent to 3/4 * 32 * 2 = 48 windows.

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars:
Total windows smashed = 64 + 48 = 112

"To determine the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to calculate the total number of blue spools and the total number of spools.

First, let's find the total number of blue spools by adding the light blue and dark blue spools.

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools by adding all the spools together.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.

"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, let's find out how many people voted by midday. 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, let's find out how many people voted by 16:00. 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by 16:00. 
The number of people remaining after midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.
5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000

"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we need to consider his daily gum consumption and the pack size.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. Over the course of 30 days, his total gum consumption will be 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces.

A standard pack of gum contains 15 pieces. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we divide his total gum consumption by the pack size: 120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs.

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we need to calculate the total number of smores required. 

First, let's calculate the number of smores needed for the kids. Since 9 kids want 2 smores each, the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.

Next, we'll calculate the number of smores needed for the adults. Since 6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.

Now, we add the number of smores needed for kids and adults to get the total number of smores required: 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we need to divide the total number of smores by 8 to find the number of sleeves required: 24 / 8 = 3.

Given that there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can now determine the number of boxes needed by dividing the number of sleeves required by 3: 3 / 3 = 1.

Therefore, the number of boxes of graham crackers needed is 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to calculate their individual ages.

Dora's age is a crucial piece of information, and it's given as 15 years. 

Now, let's calculate Dora's father's age. It's mentioned that his age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we can calculate it as follows: 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, her age can be calculated as 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their individual ages: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received in the student council election, we need to calculate the votes for each candidate.

Candidate A received 20% of the total votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, which is 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + 0.5 * 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. Candidate A and B combined received 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Candidate C received the remaining votes, which is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Therefore, candidate C received 50 votes.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's analyze the situation. Boris initially has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. This means Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck's new total is 77 + 10 = 87 apples. Meanwhile, Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

To determine how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we need to find the difference between their current apple counts. This is calculated as 90 - 87 = 3.

Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now."
"To determine the amount of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

For giant cubes, each cube uses 4 ounces of water. If Peter makes 3 giant cubes, the total water used for these cubes is 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

For medium cubes, each cube uses 2 ounces of water. If Peter makes 7 medium cubes, the total water used for these cubes is 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

For small cubes, each cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. If Peter makes 8 small cubes, the total water used for these cubes is 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, let's add up the total water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

To find out how much water Peter has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

The final answer is: 2"
"To determine the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice, we need to establish the number of books each of them has.

Clara has 20 books. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, we can calculate the number of books Steven has by dividing Clara's total by 2. This gives us 20 / 2 = 10 books for Steven.

Now, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. To find out how many books Alice has, we add 6 to Steven's total, which gives us 10 + 6 = 16 books for Alice.

To find the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice, we subtract Alice's total from Clara's total: 20 - 16 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Cecelia spent on her shopping trip, we need to calculate the cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

First, let's find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the cost of a gallon jar.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, we can find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.
Total cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5 = $50
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48

To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.
Total amount of money Cecelia spent = $50 + $48 = $98

The final answer is: $98"
"To determine the number of students who like to play video games, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students who have other hobbies.

Given that 10 students like to bake and 5 students like to play basketball, we can calculate the number of students who like to play music. Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball, we can calculate it as follows:

Students who like to play music = 2 * (students who like to play basketball)
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, let's find the total number of students who like to either play video games or play music. 
Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball)
= 50 - (10 + 5)
= 50 - 15
= 35

Since we know that students who like to play music = 10, students who like to play video games = students who like to play video games or music - students who like to play music
= 35 - 10
= 25

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of the initial number of birds.

So, 4 birds were scared away. 

Now, we subtract 4 from the initial number of birds: 
12 - 4 = 8

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 
8 + 20 = 28

The final number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with a total of 80 students, we divide 80 by 2 to find the number of students in each class: 80 / 2 = 40 students per class.

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we multiply the number of students in each class by 40% (or 0.4): 40 * 0.4 = 16 girls per class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class: 40 - 16 = 24 boys per class.

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

The final answer is: 24"

First, let's add up the total number of animals:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Total number of animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Since there are 7 days in a week, we will divide the total number of animals by 7 to find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day.

28 / 7 = 4

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

"To calculate the profit made by Mark from buying and selling packs of old magic cards, we need to consider the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the packs: 3 packs * $1800 = $5400.

The total revenue is the sum of the value of the cards: 
- 1 card worth $4000
- 1 card worth $1000
- 30 cards worth an average of $50 each: 30 * $50 = $1500
Total revenue = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"

"To determine the weekly savings of the tomato vendor, we need to calculate the difference in the cost of purchasing 500 tomatoes per day from the two vendors.

The original vendor sells tomatoes for $0.5 each, so the daily cost is 500 * $0.5 = $250.
The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.4 each, so the daily cost is 500 * $0.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the two costs: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

Therefore, the tomato vendor saves $350 per week by switching to the new vendor.

The final answer is: $350"
"To determine the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we need to establish the number of marbles each of them possesses. 

First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles. Since Cal has half as many marbles as Sean, we can calculate Cal's marbles by doubling Sean's amount: 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we can calculate Carl's marbles by multiplying Sean's amount by 4: 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

Now that we know the number of marbles each of them has, we can find the total by adding Carl's and Cal's marbles together: 224 (Carl) + 112 (Cal) = 336.

"To determine the number of additional groups needed, we first need to find the total number of students required for 12 groups. 

Since each group should have an equal number of students, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups to find the number of students per group.

Total students = 54
Number of groups = 6

Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we know that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students required, we multiply the number of groups by the students per group.

Total students required = Number of groups * Students per group
Total students required = 12 * 9
Total students required = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups.

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

Since each group requires 9 students, we need to find the number of additional groups required.

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

"To determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has after trading stickers, we need to break down the process step by step.

First, let's consider the small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them for large buttons. This means she trades 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she receives 27 small buttons from this trade.

Next, we need to consider the large stickers. Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them for large buttons. This means she trades 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she receives 20 large buttons from this trade.

Now, let's consider the remaining large stickers. After trading 20 large stickers, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she can trade these 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has. She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers. Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is 27 + 20 + 60 = 107.

However, this is not the final answer. We need to consider the buttons she received from trading small stickers for large buttons. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, and she traded 27 small stickers, she received 27 small buttons. However, she also received 20 large buttons from trading large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she received 20 large buttons. 

The total number of buttons she received from trading large stickers is 20 + 20 = 40 buttons. Since she received 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, the total number of buttons she received is 27 + 40 = 67 buttons.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has. She has 67 buttons from trading stickers and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers. Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is 67 + 60 = 127.

Considering the total number of matches played, the correct answer is 7."
"To determine the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to consider the total number of council members and the relationship between the votes in favor and against.

Given that there are 33 people on the council, and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. The number of votes in favor would then be 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered for the preschool field trip, we need to calculate the number of students for each size and add them together.

First, let's consider the number of students who need each size of shirt. We know that 11 students need extra-small shirts. Since twice as many students need small shirts as extra-small, we have 2 * 11 = 22 students who need small shirts.

Next, we find that four less students need medium shirts than small, so we have 22 - 4 = 18 students who need medium shirts.

Moving on, half as many students need large shirts as medium, which gives us 18 / 2 = 9 students who need large shirts.

Finally, six more students need extra-large shirts than large, so we have 9 + 6 = 15 students who need extra-large shirts.

Now, let's add the number of students for each size together to find the total number of shirts ordered: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

"When it comes to making smart purchasing decisions, understanding discounts can be a crucial aspect of saving money. In this case, we have a product marked at $140 with a 5% discount. To calculate the final price, we need to find the discount amount first.

To do this, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (5% or 0.05).

Discount = $140 * 0.05 = $7

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price.

Final price = Original price - Discount
Final price = $140 - $7
Final price = $133

Therefore, the total duration of the 20 playlists is 60000 hours."
"To determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win the big race, we need to calculate the percentage of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win first.

20% of the total 50 people think horse #2 will win. This is equivalent to 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 people. Now, 60% of these remaining people think horse #7 will win. This is equivalent to 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people. This is 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 people.

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16.

"To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we need to understand the proportion of Pomeranians and the proportion of female Pomeranians.

Given that one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can calculate the total number of Pomeranians by multiplying the number of girls by 3.

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can use this information to find the total number of puppies. We know that 18 Pomeranians make up two thirds of the total puppies. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up a proportion and solve for the total number of puppies.

Let's denote the total number of puppies as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

2/3 * x = 18

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 18 * (3/2)
x = 27

Therefore, Jana has a total of 27 puppies."

"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, let's break down the information given. We know that the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. 

Let's denote the number of cases the second house needs as x. Since the first house needs half the number of cases the second house needs, the first house requires x/2 cases.

The third house needs double the number of cases the first house needs, so it requires 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

Now, we can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

Therefore, to make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need to spend $60."
"To determine the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we need to calculate the number of books each of them read. 

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra read 300 books, we can find the number of books Ahmed read by dividing 300 by 2. 

300 / 2 = 150

Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so the total number of books Ezra will read is 300 + 150 = 450.

Now, we can find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed by adding the number of books each of them read.

Total books read by Ahmed = 150
Total books read by Ezra = 450
Total books read by both = 150 + 450 = 600

"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we need to calculate the remaining pencils after giving some to Brandon and Charlie.

First, Anthony gave 1/2 of his 50 pencils to Brandon. This means he gave away 25 pencils, leaving him with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. To find 3/5 of 25, we multiply 25 by 3 and then divide by 5. This gives us (25 * 3) / 5 = 75 / 5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.

Now, we subtract the pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total time Jack is away from home, we need to consider the time spent driving to and from the museum, as well as the time spent at the museum itself.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. To calculate the time spent driving, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours
Time to drive back home = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Total time driving = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

In addition to the driving time, Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is away from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum.

Total time away from home = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the number of wheels left after assembling the toys, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles.

First, let's calculate the number of wheels needed for the cars. Since each car requires 4 wheels, we multiply the number of cars by 4: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels.

Next, we calculate the number of wheels needed for the motorcycles. Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels, so we multiply the number of motorcycles by 2: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the number of wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the initial number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

Therefore, the number of wheels left is 276."
"When it comes to making a purchase, understanding discounts can be a crucial aspect of budgeting. In this case, we're looking at a laptop priced at $1000 with a 20% discount.

To calculate the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (20% or 0.20).

Discount amount = $1000 * 0.20 = $200

Now, let's subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price.

Final price = Original price - Discount amount
Final price = $1000 - $200
Final price = $800

Therefore, the final price you have to pay for the laptop is $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break down the cost into three categories: movies in series, older movies, and normal movies.

First, let's calculate the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we divide the total number of movies by 3:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:
200 * $6 = $1200

Next, we find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply the remaining movies by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"When it comes to healthy eating, incorporating a variety of fruits into your diet is essential for maintaining optimal nutrition. However, the cost of these fruits can sometimes be a concern. Let's break down the cost of Winston's fruit selection.

Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches, which are a good source of vitamin C and antioxidants. The cost of peaches is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00.

Next, he picked 8 pounds of plums, which are rich in fiber and antioxidants. The cost of plums is $1.00 per pound, so the total cost for plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00.

Lastly, he picked 6 pounds of apricots, which are an excellent source of vitamin A and potassium. The cost of apricots is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost for apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00.

To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to add the cost of each type of fruit together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To determine the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot. 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we need to consider the points they receive for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and finishing the level within the time limit.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so let's denote Emma's enemy score as x. Ava's enemy score would then be x + 8. 

Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Emma's berry score is y. Ava's berry score would then be y + 3.

The time difference between their completion of the level is 4 seconds, with Ava finishing 4 seconds slower. Since the timer is 60 seconds, Emma's timer score is 60, and Ava's timer score is 56.

The points for each component are as follows:
- Enemy score: 10 points per enemy
- Berry score: 5 points per berry
- Timer score: 30 points per second

Emma's total score is 10x + 5y + 60.
Ava's total score is 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(56).

Simplifying Ava's total score, we get 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 1680.

Combining like terms, Ava's total score is 10x + 5y + 1775.

The difference in their scores is (10x + 5y + 1775) - (10x + 5y + 60) = 1715.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1715}$"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to consider their riding schedule. They ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, which is a total of 3 * 5 = 15 times. 

On two other days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we add the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days: 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. He then bought a mix of white and orange fish from the pet store, totaling 17 fish. After adding these new fish to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O. We can set up two equations based on this information:

1. The total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so W + O = 17.
2. After adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish, so 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We can solve the second equation for O: O = 2(4 + W) - 3 = 8 + 2W - 3 = 5 + 2W.

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the first equation: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combine like terms: 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we need to consider his daily driving habits and the fuel efficiency of his vehicle. 

First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he commutes to and from work, the daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles. With a 5-day workweek, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we need to consider the fuel efficiency of Andy's car, which is 10 miles per gallon (MPG). To find out how much fuel is consumed per week, we divide the total weekly distance by the fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Now, we can calculate the total weekly fuel cost by multiplying the weekly fuel consumption by the price of gas, which is $3 per gallon: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car is $15."
"To determine the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the quarters. Carrie was given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, let's calculate the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3 and divide by 5: (10 * 3) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6. So, she spent 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total value of the twenties she spent is 6 * $20 = $120.

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties to find the total amount of money she spent: $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"When it comes to gardening, understanding the yield of your plants is crucial for planning and harvesting. In this case, we have two types of plants: tomato and eggplant. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, while each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.

To determine the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the yield from each type of plant. For the tomato plants, we have 5 plants, so the total yield would be 5 * 22 = 110 tomatoes.

Moving on to the eggplant plants, we have 8 plants, and each plant yields 4 eggplants. Therefore, the total yield from the eggplant plants would be 8 * 4 = 32 eggplants.

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we simply add the yields from both types of plants: 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to calculate the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point.

The current temperature during the night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. The temperature difference between the freezing point (32 degrees) and the night temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the total number of seashells brought back by the groups, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of groups formed. Since 90 people were required to split into groups, and each group consists of 9 people, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we need to find the number of groups that brought back seashells. Since 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, we can calculate this as follows:

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we can find the total number of seashells brought back by these groups. Since each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells, we can calculate the total number of seashells as follows:

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

"When it comes to making smart financial decisions, it's essential to consider the discounts and prices of the items we purchase. In this case, Mike is looking to buy a pair of jeans that are originally priced at $40. However, he's fortunate to find them on sale for 25% off.

To calculate the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage. In this case, the discount is 25% of $40, which is equivalent to 0.25 * $40 = $10. 

Now, let's find the price after the discount by subtracting the discount from the original price: $40 - $10 = $30.

If Mike pays with a $50 bill, we can calculate the amount of money he'll have left over by subtracting the price after the discount from the $50 bill: $50 - $30 = $20.

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after purchasing the jeans.

"To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign, we need to consider the contributions of both the students and the teachers.

First, let's calculate the total number of students involved in the campaign. With 40 classes and an average of 25 students per class, we can find the total number of students by multiplying these two numbers.

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is equal to the total number of students.

Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Next, we need to calculate the total number of trees planted by the teachers. With 40 classes and an average of 3 teachers per class, we can find the total number of teachers by multiplying these two numbers.

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants two trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is twice the total number of teachers.

Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

To find the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign, we add the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to determine the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then calculate 30% of that number.

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more.

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we can set up the equation:

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the target hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and if Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

Next, we calculate the hours Kris played in 1 week. There are 7 days in a week, and if Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Now, we add the hours Kris played in 2 weeks and 1 week: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

The final answer is: 9"
"When analyzing the movement of two vehicles on a highway, we need to consider their relative speeds and the time they travel. In this scenario, the first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, while the second car is moving at 70 miles per hour.

To determine the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we must calculate the distance each car covers in that time frame. The distance traveled by an object is given by the formula: distance = speed * time.

For the first car, traveling at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, the distance covered is:
distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

For the second car, traveling at 70 miles per hour for 2 hours, the distance covered is:
distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars is the difference between the distances they have traveled:
distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours is 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"When it comes to calculating the total cost of a custom-made item like a ring, we need to consider the cost of the individual components and any additional fees. In this case, the diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. To find the total cost of the diamond and gold, we simply add these two amounts together.

Cost of diamond: $600
Cost of gold: $300
Total cost of diamond and gold: $600 + $300 = $900

However, there's an additional 30% premium for the ring to be made. To calculate this premium, we multiply the total cost of the diamond and gold by 0.3.

Premium: 0.3 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold to find the final amount James paid.

Total cost with premium: $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid a total of $1170 for the ring."
"To determine the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders. Since 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80 out of 400.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we first need to calculate the total number of square inches Milo can create with the glass chips. Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips he has.

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with 144 chips.

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height.

Area = length * width
12 = length * 3
length = 12 / 3
length = 4

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the initial amount of tea at the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea consumed to gallons by dividing by 4. However, we are looking for the initial amount of tea, which is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left. 

The tea left is 10 quarts. 

The initial amount of tea is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left, which is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

Therefore, the initial amount of tea at the party was 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Dale initially ordered 100 candies. However, he ended up selling 150 candies. To find out how many candies he has left, we need to consider the fact that he ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold. 

Let's calculate the total number of candies Dale has: 100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 candies.

Since he sold 150 candies, we need to find out how many he still needs to sell to sell all of his candy. To do this, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies: 200 - 150 = 50.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, we need to calculate the number of times the initial number of students doubles from January to May.

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

The number of students at the end of May is 160. To find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to calculate the total number of branches he climbed and then divide that by the number of days he worked.

First, let's find the total number of branches Felix climbed. We know he made $105 and charges $0.25 per branch. 

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we can now find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we need to calculate the total number of marshmallows left after accounting for those used and dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used. John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they used 18 marshmallows. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

Now, let's subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag. The bag originally contained 35 marshmallows. After subtracting the used and dropped marshmallows, we have 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows left.

Since there are two kids, John and DeSean, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to determine how many S'mores each kid can have. Therefore, each kid can have 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total amount of money used at the arcade, we need to consider the time each person plays and the cost per minute.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is equivalent to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. His two friends who are less skilled play for half the time, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. The friend who is more skilled plays for 1.5 times the time, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played is 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

The total amount of money used is 840 * 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"When creating a salt scrub, it's essential to balance the ingredients to achieve the right consistency and effectiveness. In this case, Tanya is making a scrub that fills a 10-ounce jar. Let's break down the ingredients and their relationships.

The amount of citrus zest and fragrance is equal, which we can denote as x. The amount of salt and sugar is also equal, which is 2x. Since the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, it's 4x. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of the scrub: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combining like terms, we get 8x = 10. To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

Therefore, Tanya uses 5 ounces of oil in her salt scrub recipe.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount of money spent by John at the market, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is calculated by multiplying the number of goats by the cost per goat: 3 goats * $500 = $1500.

The cost of the cows is calculated by multiplying the number of cows by the cost per cow: 2 cows * $1500 = $3000.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500 at the market."
"To determine the number of additional cupcakes Paul should purchase for the birthday party, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of cupcakes required and the number of cupcakes he already has.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 48 cupcakes.

To find the number of additional cupcakes needed, we subtract the number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total number of cupcakes required:

63 (total cupcakes needed) - 48 (cupcakes already have) = 15

Therefore, Paul should purchase 15 more cupcakes to meet the total requirement.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother, we need to consider the initial number of cars he has, the number of cars he sells, and the number of cars he gives away.

Since Robert has 20 cars and Joe has twice as many, Joe initially has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

He then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine how much each student raised for the charity, we need to calculate the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity received a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the students must have raised the remaining amount.

The amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

This means each student raised $6,250 for the charity."
"When it comes to physical activity, it's essential to understand the duration and intensity of exercise to ensure optimal health benefits. In this case, we're looking at the walking habits of an individual named Sandy.

Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day, which is a significant amount of time. To put this into perspective, the American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week. Sandy's 8-hour walk on the first day already exceeds this recommendation.

On the second day, Sandy walked for half the time she walked on the first day, which is 4 hours. This is still a substantial amount of time and can be beneficial for cardiovascular health.

To calculate the total time Sandy walked in the two days, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy walked in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

**Total walking time in two days: 720 minutes**"
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to calculate the number of cars present in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we need to calculate his daily earnings first. Since he completes 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle consists of 5 tasks, we can find his daily earnings by multiplying the number of cycles by the number of tasks and the pay per task.

Daily earnings = 30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle * $1.20/task
Daily earnings = 150 tasks/day * $1.20/task
Daily earnings = $180/day

Now, to find his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 7, as there are 7 days in a week.

Weekly earnings = $180/day * 7 days
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To determine the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate her points in each game and add them together.

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha struggled and scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, we need to find Julie's score in the first game. To do this, we subtract 4 from Sasha's score in the first game: 14 - 4 = 10. 

Now that we know Julie scored 10 points in the first game, we can find Sasha's score in the second game by subtracting 6 from Julie's score in the first game: 10 - 6 = 4.

To find the total points Sasha scored, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"When it comes to pet nutrition, it's essential to consider the quantity of food each pet requires. In this scenario, we're comparing the amount of cat food to dog food purchased by Kimberly.

To determine the total amount of cat food, we multiply the number of cat food packages by the number of tins per package: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins of cat food.

Next, we calculate the total amount of dog food by multiplying the number of dog food packages by the number of tins per package: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins of dog food.

To find the difference between the two, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of cards each person has. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

First, let's consider the number of green eggs. We know Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Next, we need to find the number of blue eggs. Since Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of green eggs by 2. So, 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.

Now, let's determine the number of pink eggs. We know Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so we subtract 1 from the number of blue eggs. Therefore, 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, we need to find the number of yellow eggs. Since Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, we can calculate this by dividing the number of pink eggs by 3. So, 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the total loss Milly will incur, we need to consider the shipping costs and the refund amount. 

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles. 

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
- Cost per pound: $0.35
- Weight of the book: 4 pounds
- Cost per mile: $0.08
- Distance: 20 miles
- Total cost of shipping: (0.35 * 4) + (0.08 * 20) = 1.4 + 1.6 = $2.99

Next, we need to determine the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The purchase price of the book is $32.

- Refund amount: 0.75 * 32 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
- Total cost of shipping: $2.99
- Refund amount: $24
- Total loss: 2.99 + (32 - 24) = 2.99 + 8 = $10.99

The final answer is: $10.99"
"Let's break down Mulan's financial situation step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Mulan has after her father gave her $100. Initially, she had $40, and her father added $100, so she now has $40 + $100 = $140.

Next, we need to determine the total amount of money she spent on her purchases. She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which is 2 * $30 = $60. Additionally, she bought a bag for $20. The total amount of money she spent is $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.

To find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total amount of money she spent from the total amount of money she had initially: $140 - $80 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate. 
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate her weekly time commitment and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's break down her weekly activities:

1. Writing amateur songs: 2 hours per week, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.
2. Doing makeup: 15 minutes per day, six days a week, totaling 90 minutes.
3. Recording videos: 18 videos per week, each lasting 4 minutes, totaling 72 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities: 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours.

Therefore, Britany spends a total of 18.8 hours on TikTok in a month.

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To determine the total cost of the interior design installation, we need to consider the initial installation fee and the cost of additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures for a flat fee of $129.00.

Angela has 6 additional mirrors, 1 additional chandelier, and 10 additional pictures that she needs installed. We need to calculate the cost of these extra items.

The cost of each additional item is $15.00. Therefore, the total cost of the additional items is:

- 6 additional mirrors: 6 * $15.00 = $90.00
- 1 additional chandelier: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- 10 additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $90.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $255.00.

To find the total cost, we add the initial installation fee to the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $255.00 = $384.00.

The final answer is: $384.00"
"To determine the amount of money Roy has saved, we need to consider the relationships between the savings of Roy, Anthony, and Eva.

Eva has saved $20.00. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.

To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to understand the lifting capacity of each individual in relation to Pompei, who can lift a mountain 1 inch.

First, we know Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, which is 12 inches.

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

The final answer is: 40"
"When it comes to physical activity, it's essential to consider the impact of rest periods on overall performance. In this case, Mason is engaging in a bike journey at a moderate pace of 8 miles per hour. 

To calculate the total distance traveled, we need to consider the time spent cycling. Mason cycles for 4 hours, takes a break, and then continues for another 6 hours. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Considering the total time spent cycling, Mason's overall physical exertion is moderate, which is beneficial for cardiovascular health. The total distance covered is the sum of the distances traveled during each segment.

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, we need to first establish the time it takes for one kangaroo to make the journey. Since three kangaroos can travel the distance in 18 hours, we can calculate the time for one kangaroo by multiplying 18 hours by 3.

18 hours * 3 = 54 hours

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, it will take them twice as long to cover the same distance.

To find the time it takes for four turtles, we multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2, and then multiply by 4 to account for the four turtles.

54 hours * 2 = 108 hours
108 hours * 4 = 432 hours

However, this is not the correct answer. We only need to multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2 to account for the turtles traveling at half the speed.

54 hours * 2 = 108 hours

The final answer is: 108"

"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we need to consider the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's help.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 and her mom gave her $80, so the total amount of money she received is: 
$150 + $80 = $230

Since Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs: 
$400 + $50 = $450

Now, we can calculate the amount of money Erika had in her purse initially by subtracting the money she received from the total amount she has: 
$450 - $230 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"When it comes to snacking, it's essential to consider the nutritional value of the food we choose. In this case, apples are a great option due to their high fiber and antioxidant content. However, the number of slices we have left after eating is what we're concerned with here.

Let's break down the number of slices from the large and small apples. A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Total number of slices = 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 - 15 = 15

"To determine the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we first need to calculate the total milk production per cow per day. 

The milk production rate per cow is 5 liters per day. To find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we can divide the total milk production required (25 liters) by the milk production rate per cow (5 liters).

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to have 5 cows in total.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

"Let's break down Craig's expenses to determine how much money he has left.

Craig initially has $40, which is a decent amount for a day out. He decides to spend it on some fun items – six squirt guns for $2 each and three packs of water balloons for $3 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of the squirt guns. Since he buys six of them at $2 each, the total cost is 6 x $2 = $12.

Next, we calculate the cost of the water balloons. He buys three packs at $3 each, so the total cost is 3 x $3 = $9.

Now, we add the cost of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent: $12 + $9 = $21.

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

"To determine the total number of socks and dishes Jack and Peter have together, we need to establish the quantities of each item they possess.

First, let's consider the number of dishes Jack has. It's given that Jack collected 60 dishes.

Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can calculate the number of socks Jack has by dividing the number of dishes by 2. This gives us 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Now, let's consider Peter's sock collection. It's stated that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Next, we need to determine the number of dishes Peter has. It's mentioned that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the quantities of each item. The total number of socks is 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 90. The total number of dishes is 60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90.

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes Jack and Peter have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To determine the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the distribution of their skills.

Let's break down the information:

- Total students = 20
- Students good at math only = 5
- Students good at English only = 8

Since the remaining students are good at both math and English, we can calculate the number of students good at both subjects by subtracting the students good at math only and English only from the total number of students.

Students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to consider the total number of glue sticks required for his students and the number of glue sticks per pack.

First, let's calculate the total number of glue sticks needed for 27 students, with each student receiving 2 glue sticks. This is a straightforward multiplication problem:

Total number of students: 27
Number of glue sticks per student: 2
Total number of glue sticks required: 27 * 2 = 54

Now, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are required to meet this demand. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To do this, we'll divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack:

Number of glue sticks per pack: 8
Number of packs required: 54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river at a specific point, we need to consider the changes in water volume over three consecutive days.

On the first day, the initial volume of water is 4000 gallons. 

On the second day, the water volume doubles, resulting in 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the water volume increases by 6000 gallons, leading to a total of 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we add the volumes from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To determine the total number of people infected after three days, we need to understand the pattern of infection. Each infected person infects six others every day. This is an exponential growth pattern, where the number of new infections is directly proportional to the number of existing infections.

Day 1: 
- Initially, there are 10 people infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, resulting in 10 * 6 = 60 new infections.
- Total people infected after Day 1: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2: 
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total people infected after Day 2: 70 (previous) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 490.

Day 3: 
- The 360 people infected on Day 2 infect 360 * 6 = 2160 new people.
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total people infected after Day 3: 490 (previous) + 2160 (new) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 3070.

"To find the total amount of money received by Julieta and Rafaela as tips, we need to calculate the tips received by each of them.

Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, each giving $20. So, her total tips are 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.1, which equals $80. 

Now, we subtract $80 from $800 to find Julieta's total tips: $800 - $80 = $720.

The total amount of money they received as tips is the sum of their individual tips: $800 + $720 = $1520.

"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. 
She gave her only boy 3 oranges. 
So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges initially. 
To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges: 
12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

"To determine the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a 1-year time frame, let's analyze their earning rates.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. Given that Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, Amber's earning rate is 1/2 badge per month. Wendy, on the other hand, earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, which translates to 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person can be calculated as follows:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount raised from the banana bread fundraiser, we need to consider the baking and sales process.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices baked. Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour, and she bakes for 5 hours. So, the total number of loaves baked is 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Now, let's consider the sales. Each slice is sold for 50 cents. To find the total amount raised, we need to convert the total number of slices to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can divide the total number of slices by 100 to get the total amount in dollars.

80 slices / 100 = 0.8 dollars per slice

Now, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised:

0.8 * 80 = 64 dollars

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30 and G = 70.

Since G = S + 30 and G = 70, we can set up the equation S + 30 = 70.

To find S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

S + 30 - 30 = 70 - 30
S = 40

Now that we know S = 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = S + G
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"When planning a school event like a picnic, it's essential to consider the nutritional needs of the students and the overall health implications of the food choices. In this case, a burrito is a convenient and nutritious food option that can provide a good balance of carbohydrates, protein, and fiber.

To determine the number of leftover burritos, we need to calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George. There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. This means the students consumed a total of 50 * 10 = 500 burritos.

Mr. George, being a teacher, also had a share of the burritos. He ate 20 of them.

The total number of burritos consumed is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos in total, the number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

**The final answer is: 80**"
"To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, we need to calculate the total number of non-yellow cars first. 

The rink has 12 red cars. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, which is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, which can be expressed as S = A + 25. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, which can be expressed as A = F - 12.

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25, which simplifies to S = F + 13.

We also know that the total number of books they have together is 85, which can be expressed as S + A + F = 85.

Substituting the first equation into this equation, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85. Combining like terms, we get 2F + A + 13 = 85.

Substituting the second equation into this equation, we get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85. Combining like terms, we get 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get 3F = 84. Dividing both sides by 3, we get F = 28.

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: 28"
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we need to calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes first. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Now, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To determine the amount of Jello needed for the party, we need to consider the number of children attending and the desired number of Jello cups per child. In this case, there are 30 kids, and each child will receive 4 Jello cups. 

To calculate the total number of Jello cups required, we multiply the number of children by the number of Jello cups per child: 30 * 4 = 120 Jello cups.

Since one box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes are required to meet the demand. We can do this by dividing the total number of Jello cups needed by the number of Jello cups produced per box: 120 / 10 = 12 boxes.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the Jello. Each box costs $1.25, so we multiply the number of boxes needed by the cost per box: 12 * $1.25 = $15.

Therefore, Greg will spend $15 on Jello for the party.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the change the seller will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones and subtract that from the amount given.

The electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of phones by the price of each phone: 
5 phones * $700 = $3500

Now, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will receive $500 in change."
"To determine how much Keenan spends on groceries per week, we first need to calculate his monthly expenditure. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%.

The total monthly expenditure is $400. To find 40% of this amount, we multiply $400 by 0.4.

$400 * 0.4 = $160

This is the amount Keenan spends on groceries in a month. To find out how much he spends per week, we divide this amount by the number of weeks in a month, which is 4.

$160 / 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries."
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the pieces consumed on each day and add them up.

First, let's calculate the pieces eaten on the first day. Tobias ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day: 
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

The total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is 48."
"To determine the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to calculate the cost of each item first.

The cost of soda is $21.00 for 7 bottles, so the cost of 1 bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00. 

The cost of water is $8.00 for 4 bottles, so the cost of 1 bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The final answer is: $13.00"

To find the number of correct answers, we multiply the total number of questions by the percentage of correct answers: 20 * 0.9 = 18. Since each question is worth 1 point, the total points from true/false questions is 18.

Now, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. There are 5 questions, and Amy correctly answers 60% of them. To find the number of correct answers, we multiply the total number of questions by the percentage of correct answers: 5 * 0.6 = 3. Since each question is worth 5 points, the total points from long-answer questions is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find Amy's total score, we add the points from each type of question: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41.

"To determine the cost price of the chickens Isaias bought, we need to first find out how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens on his farm, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Now, we know that he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each. To find the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000. This means the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, we can find the cost price by subtracting the profit from the selling price:

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

Therefore, the cost price of the chickens Isaias bought is $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To determine the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we need to first find out how many glasses Micah sold. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 2.

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

The final answer is: $\boxed{-2}$"
"To determine the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400. 

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hair service: 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure: 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To determine how much money Sarah will have left over after buying a new rope, we need to consider the total amount of money she receives from selling her original rope and the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the rope. If she sells it for $2 per meter and the rope is 20 meters long, the total amount of money she receives is:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Next, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. If the new rope costs $1.5 per meter and it's also 20 meters long, the total cost of the new rope is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, let's find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope:
$40 - $30 = $10

"To determine when Melanie's age will be thrice her present age, we need to consider her current age and the rate at which she grows. 

First, let's establish Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, she will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 10 from 18. This gives us her current age as 8 years.

Now, let's consider the condition where her age is thrice her present age. We can represent this as an equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8, where 'x' is the number of years it takes for her age to be thrice her present age.

Solving for 'x', we get x = 24 - 8 = 16.

Therefore, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, each packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4. The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, we find the cost of the apples. Since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, and the 3 packs of strawberries cost $12, each pack of strawberries costs $12 / 3 = $4. Therefore, each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2. The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we can find the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"To determine the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to consider the total runtime of her final concert, which includes both the extended performance and the encore. The total runtime is given as 65 minutes, and the encore is 15 minutes long. 

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can represent the runtime of the extended performance as 2x, where x is the runtime of her usual concert. 

We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

Therefore, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the current number of toys Argo has, we need to consider the initial number of toys and the number of toys given away. 

Argo initially had 200 toys. He then distributed 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

To find the total number of toys given away, we add the number of toys given to each individual: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50

Therefore, Argo currently has 50 toys.

The final answer is: 50"

"To determine the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage, we need to consider the total number of microphones and the percentage that won't fit.

Let's assume the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2x.

The singer has 50 microphones in total, and 20% of them won't find any space to fit in. This means 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

0.8 * 50 = 2x
40 = 2x
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To determine the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's consider the birds nesting in the bushes. We have a clear count of 6 birds.

Next, we have birds flying overhead, which is 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. To find this, we multiply 6 by 2/3, which equals 4 birds.

Now, let's consider the birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8 to get a total of 24 birds.

To find the total number of birds, we add the number of birds in each group: 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

Therefore, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds."
"When it comes to portion control and healthy snacking, it's essential to understand how to divide treats like cookies among multiple containers. In this case, Lani baked 55 cookies and decided to share them equally among five jars.

To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we need to calculate the total number of cookies left after she ate 5. This is done by subtracting the cookies she consumed from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 55 - 5 = 50

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars to find out how many cookies each jar will contain.

Number of jars = 5
Cookies per jar = Cookies left / Number of jars = 50 / 5 = 10

Therefore, each jar will have 10 cookies.

"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we need to establish the relationship between the whirligig, the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit. We are given that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob and that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

First, we calculate the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now, we know that the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"As a health expert, I'd be happy to help you understand the cost of Ellen's daily diet.

Ellen's daily diet consists of two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which means it costs $3. 

To find out the cost of one carrot, we need to consider the total cost of her daily diet, which is $11. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Where 'x' represents the cost of one carrot.

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

Therefore, the cost of one carrot is $1.

"To determine the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to calculate the total amount she earned from mowing lawns and then subtract that from the total amount she made.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. Similarly, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, which is 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x.

We know that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. Therefore, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

Since the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

We know that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, which means x = 1. Substituting this into the equation 54x + y = 80, we get:

54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"To determine how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we need to establish the initial number of notebooks each had. Since Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7, we can calculate her initial number of notebooks by subtracting the additional notebooks from the total. 

Martha's initial number of notebooks = 7 (total) - 5 (additional) = 2

Given that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we can calculate his initial number of notebooks by multiplying Martha's initial number by 3.

Joseph's initial number of notebooks = 3 * 2 = 6

Now, we can find the difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph by subtracting Joseph's initial number from Martha's initial number.

Difference = Martha's initial number - Joseph's initial number = 2 - 6 = -4

However, since we are looking for how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we need to consider the absolute value of the difference.

Martha has 4 fewer notebooks than Joseph, but since we are looking for how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, the correct answer is that Martha has 4 fewer notebooks than Joseph."

"When it comes to meal planning and portion control, it's essential to consider the nutritional needs of each family member. In this scenario, we have a pot of soup that can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin, his wife, and their two children will be eating dinner, we need to determine how many bowls of soup will be left over.

There are 4 adults and 2 children, making a total of 6 people. Since each person will eat one bowl, we can calculate the number of bowls used. The pot can fill 8 child bowls, but only 4 adult bowls were used for dinner. This means 4 adult bowls were used, which is equivalent to 4 child bowls.

Now, let's calculate the number of child bowls left over. Since 4 child bowls were used for dinner, we subtract this from the total capacity of the pot: 8 child bowls - 4 child bowls = 4 child bowls left over.

Each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, and there are 2 children. To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we divide the number of child bowls left over by the number of children: 4 child bowls / 2 children = 2.

Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To determine the amount of allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

The cost of the cake is $11. 
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"When it comes to maintaining a balanced diet and healthy eating habits, it's essential to keep track of the fruits we consume. Let's calculate the total number of fruits Kira bought at the grocery store.

To do this, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges she purchased.

Apples: 3
Bananas: 5
Oranges: 6

Total number of fruits = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

However, Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit. To find out how many pieces are left, we need to subtract the number of fruits Lola ate from the total number of fruits.

Fruits left = Total number of fruits - Fruits eaten
= 14 - 2
= 12

Therefore, there are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To determine the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students participating in each sport and then add them together.

First, let's consider the students playing tennis. There are 6 students participating in this sport.

Next, we have the students playing volleyball. Since the number of students playing volleyball is twice the number playing tennis, we can calculate this as 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, let's move on to the students playing soccer. We have 16 boys and 22 girls participating in this sport, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

To find the total number of students, we add the number of students playing each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, the total number of students is 56."
"To calculate the profit made from selling lollipops, we need to consider the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's determine the total revenue. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each, and there are 30 students. So, the total revenue is 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.8/lollipop = $240.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. The lollipops were bought for $0.5 each, and the same number of lollipops was sold. Therefore, the total cost is 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.5/lollipop = $150.

Now, we can find the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $240 - $150 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

First, let's start with the number of cats. Larry has 3 cats.

Next, we know that he has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Moving on, we find that he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Now, let's consider the fish. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, which means he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Lastly, we have the gerbils. His collection of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"When it comes to managing food consumption, it's essential to consider the caloric intake and nutritional balance. However, in this scenario, we're focusing on the quantity of bread consumed.

Assuming a standard loaf of bread has 24 slices, and Abby's daily consumption is 2 slices, while Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which is 4 slices per day.

Together, their combined daily consumption is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

To determine how long the loaf of bread will last, we need to divide the total number of slices by their combined daily consumption: 24 / 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To determine the total number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to consider the duration of time she has been collecting shells. Since Martha collects one shell per month, we can calculate the total number of shells by multiplying the number of years she has been collecting by the number of months in a year.

There are 12 months in a year, and Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years. 

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows. 

So, the number of cups in each row is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 / 2 = 4.5. However, since you can't have half a cup of tea, this means that the number of mint tea cups in each row must be 4 or 5.

Let's consider the two possibilities:

- If there are 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. 
- If there are 5 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15.

Since the total number of mint tea cups is 15, the correct answer is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to calculate how many trips he can make in 8 hours. Given that it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Since the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = 12 berries per trip.

Therefore, the sloth can pick up 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to calculate the initial amount of water in the tank and then subtract the total amount of water used over the 6-day period.

The initial amount of water in the tank is half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 gallons. Therefore, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of water used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the total amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget. Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"When it comes to baked goods, it's essential to consider the calorie content, especially when consuming them in large quantities. To determine the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Given that Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Similarly, a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

To find the total calories from both types of pastries, we add the calories from cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To calculate the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to consider the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs. 
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, which is 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is the sum of the Junebugs removed each day: 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378.

There are 5 days in total. 

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days: 378 / 5 = 75.6

The average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 75.6."
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we need to calculate the total distance each vehicle covered.

The bus, traveling at 60 miles per hour, covered a distance of 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car, traveling at 30 miles per hour, covered a distance of 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we need to calculate the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls and then subtract that from the total number of toys after the purchase.

The total number of toys before buying bouncy balls can be found by adding the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Number of blocks = 31
Number of stuffed animals = 8
Number of stacking rings = 9

Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls = 31 + 8 + 9
= 48

Now, we know that the total number of toys after buying bouncy balls is 62. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the total number of toys before buying bouncy balls from the total number of toys after buying bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after buying bouncy balls - Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls
= 62 - 48

"To find Peter's age, we need to consider the given information about the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean, as well as the relationship between their ages.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J. 

We are given that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, which can be expressed as Pp = J + 10. Additionally, Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, which can be expressed as P = Pp + J.

We can start by substituting Pp with J + 10 in the equation P = Pp + J:
P = (J + 10) + J
Combine like terms:
P = 2J + 10

Now, we are also given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, which can be expressed as P + Pp + J = 100. We can substitute Pp with J + 10 in this equation:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now we have two equations:
1. P = 2J + 10
2. P + 2J + 10 = 100

We can substitute the expression for P from the first equation into the second equation:
(2J + 10) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total number of water balloons, let's break down the situation. Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon for herself. Her 4 friends each received 2 water balloons, resulting in a total of 4 * 2 = 8 water balloons. 

Adding Maria's initial balloon to her friends' balloons, we get 1 + 8 = 9 water balloons. 

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 additional water balloons. With 5 people in total, the number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

To find the total number of water balloons, we add the initial number to the additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

"When it comes to watermelon seed spitting contests, it's essential to consider the physical demands and potential health implications. However, in this scenario, we're focusing on the average total distance spat.

To calculate the average total distance spat, we need to consider the total distance each participant achieves and divide it by the number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits each of her 40 seeds 10 feet, resulting in a total distance of 400 feet. Sydney, on the other hand, spits each of her 35 seeds 12 feet, resulting in a total distance of 420 feet.

The combined total distance spat is 400 + 420 = 820 feet. Since they spat a total of 75 seeds (40 from Zoey and 35 from Sydney), we can calculate the average total distance spat by dividing the total distance by the number of seeds.

Average total distance spat = 820 feet / 75 seeds = 10.93 feet

This average distance can be an interesting metric to consider in the context of a watermelon seed spitting contest, but it's essential to remember that such activities should be done in moderation and with proper precautions to avoid any potential health risks."
"To determine the financial difference between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to consider their production rates and the selling price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. Assuming a 24-hour operation for 30 days, we have:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, we calculate the total revenue from each machine, given that each widget sells for $6:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay at the hotel, we need to calculate the cost of the 24-hour option and the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours. 

The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos. 

The 12-hour option costs 1000 pesos, and Cameron needs to add 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark. Since he stays for 17 hours, he needs to add 70 * 5 = 350 pesos for the additional 5 hours.

So, the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: 250"
"To determine the total amount of hay needed for Nate's livestock, we need to calculate the amount each sheep requires. Since each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, we can find the amount each sheep needs by first doubling the amount for a goat and then subtracting 3 pounds.

Doubling the amount for a goat gives us 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. Subtracting 3 pounds from this amount results in 10 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay required for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"Let's break down the situation. James initially purchases 10 CDs at $15 each, resulting in a total cost of $150. However, he receives a 40% discount, which is $60. After the discount, he spends $90 on the CDs.

James then decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each, earning a total of $200. To determine his financial outcome, we need to compare his expenses and earnings.

Expenses: $90 (CDs after discount)
Earnings: $200 (from selling 5 CDs)

Considering his earnings exceed his expenses, James actually makes a profit. To find the amount he was out, we need to calculate the difference between his earnings and expenses.

Profit = Earnings - Expenses
Profit = $200 - $90
Profit = $110

However, the question asks how much money he was out, implying a loss. Since James made a profit, he was not out any money. In fact, he was $110 ahead.

"To determine the time it took James to swim across the lake, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to swim 60% of the 20-mile lake. To find 60% of 20 miles, we multiply 0.6 by 20.

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. Since he swam for 6 hours, he rests for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

"To determine the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times. The commission rate is 10% and the price per copy is $5. We can use the formula: Commission = (Number of copies sold * Price per copy * Commission rate) / 100.

For the New York Times: 
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
- Commission = 300 / 100
- Commission = $3

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal. The commission rate is 8% and the price per copy is $15. We can use the same formula.

For the Wall Street Journal: 
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
- Commission = 1200 / 100
- Commission = $12

Now, let's add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission earned by Cayley.

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3 + $12
- Total commission = $15

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to consider the information given. Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored.

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We also know that B + A + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (A + 20) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45. 

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (D + 10) + A + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and 2D + A + 10 = 45. 

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (2D + A + 10) = 45 - 45. 

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0. 

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10. 

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get B = (D - 10) + 20. 

This simplifies to B = D + 10. 

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get D + 10 = A + 20. 

We can subtract 10 from both sides to get D = A + 10. 

Now we have A = D - 10 and D = A + 10. 

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = (A + 10) - 10. 

This simplifies to A = A. 

We can substitute D = A + 10 into the equation 2A + D + 20 = 45 to get 2(D - 10) + D + 20 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D - 20 + 20 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = 15 - 10. 

This simplifies to A = 5. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the printing and stacking of the pages. Each paper is printed on both sides, which means each paper contributes two pages to the book.

Given that the paper is stacked 100 pages to the inch, we can calculate the total number of pages per inch by doubling the number of pages per inch. This results in 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we need to find the total number of pages in the book, which is 1.5 inches thick. To do this, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 200 * 1.5 = 300 pages.

The final answer is: 300"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:
15 * 60 = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 / 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 * 60 = 1800

The total number of reports Vince stapled is 1800."
"To determine the total sleep time for Kim, we need to calculate the time she spent sleeping in bed, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim's usual sleep schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, her usual sleep time is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her actual wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.

To find the time she went to bed, we need to subtract the 5 minutes from her usual wake-up time. Her usual bedtime is 10 p.m., but since she woke up 5 minutes earlier, her actual bedtime was 10 p.m. - 5 minutes = 9:55 p.m.

Now, we can calculate the total time she was in bed by subtracting her actual bedtime from her actual wake-up time: 5:55 a.m. - 9:55 p.m. = 8 hours and 0 minutes, which is equivalent to 480 minutes.

However, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking, which is 23 minutes. Therefore, the total time she slept in bed is 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

The final answer is: 457"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to calculate the initial number of measuring spoons he has. Since he has two dozen cups, we first find the total number of cups by multiplying 2 by 12.

2 * 12 = 24 cups

Next, we calculate the number of measuring spoons he has, which is 2/3 of the number of cups.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, we subtract 6 from the total number of spoons to find the remaining number of spoons.

16 - 6 = 10 spoons

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining spoons and the number of cups.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to consider the initial occupancy rate and the daily admissions due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 of them occupied. This means that 1/5 of 1000 beds are initially occupied, which is 200 beds. 

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity.

1000 - 200 = 800

However, due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Over a period of 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of admissions would be:

50 * 14 = 700

Now, we add the number of occupied beds initially to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

200 + 700 = 900

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity.

1000 - 900 = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down her daily email activity. 

First, we calculate the number of non-work emails. Since she sends 16 emails a day and 7 are work-related, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Next, we find out how many of these non-work emails are to family. Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family, which is (2/3) * 9 = 6.

Now, we need to find out how many non-work emails are not to family. This is 9 - 6 = 3.

Finally, we determine how many of these non-work emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of the remaining non-work emails are to her boyfriend, which is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we need to understand the age relationships between Shawna, Aliya, and Shawna's father.

We know that Aliya is 3 years old. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3. 

Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

Now, we are given that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. To find Shawna's father's age, we multiply Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 9 * 5 = 45 years

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the percentage of the number reported by Courtney that represents the actual attendance.

Let's assume the number reported by Courtney is 100%. If Kelly stated that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, then the actual number of people who attended the concert is 80% of the number reported by Courtney.

To find 80% of 48, we multiply 48 by 0.8.
48 * 0.8 = 38.4

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To determine the total number of basketballs the coach brought to practice, we need to understand the relationship between the number of balls carried by each of the three boys: Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey.

Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Similarly, since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2x = 4x balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them. So, the total number of balls is x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried 2x balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the equation 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x
Total number of balls = 7 * 1
Total number of balls = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day and subtract the number of holes present at the end of the third day.

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day. On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of corn chips, let's analyze the situation. Amora and Lainey received an equal amount of corn chips, which is 70 each. Collins, on the other hand, received 15 more corn chips than the others.

Since Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add the number of corn chips that each person received. 

Total = Amora's corn chips + Lainey's corn chips + Collins' corn chips
Total = 70 + 70 + 85
Total = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To determine the total cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The cost of travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of Pokémon caught by each individual. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so L = S + 5.

Additionally, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Next, we can substitute the third equation into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.
9A - 21 = 339.

Now, we can add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Next, we can divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we need to consider the relationship between the number of episodes and their individual lengths. 

Given that each episode is 20 minutes long, we can infer that the number of episodes is half of this duration. Therefore, the number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

To calculate the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

This indicates that John will spend a total of 200 minutes watching the show if he views every episode."
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to consider the bird's movements in both the southerly and northerly directions.

First, let's calculate the distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction. The bird flew for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. Using the formula distance = speed * time, we can find the distance traveled in the first leg of the journey.

Distance traveled in the first 10 hours = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

Next, the bird flew for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour in the southerly direction. Using the same formula, we can find the distance traveled in the last leg of the journey.

Distance traveled in the last 5 hours = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

The total distance traveled in the southerly direction is the sum of the distances traveled in the first and last legs.

Total distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

Now, let's consider the bird's movement in the northerly direction. The bird flew for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.

Distance traveled in the 2 hours = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction.

Distance between the homes = Total distance traveled in the southerly direction - Distance traveled in the northerly direction
Distance between the homes = 410 miles - 36 miles
Distance between the homes = 374 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta received. She made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is equivalent to 12 brownies. 

Next, she received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is equivalent to 6 brownies. 

Additionally, she received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is equivalent to 48 brownies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

However, during the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is equivalent to 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

To find the total number of brownies left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received: 66 - 18 = 48.

Therefore, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is: 48"
"To determine the total age of all three family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we need to multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).

Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together: Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"When it comes to calculating the total cost of purchasing phones for John, his 2 kids, and his wife, we need to consider the pricing strategy. The first two phones are priced at $600 each, resulting in a total of 2 * $600 = $1200.

For the remaining two phones, each is half the price of the initial two, which means they cost $600 / 2 = $300 each. Therefore, the total cost for these two phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

To find the overall cost, we add the cost of the first two phones to the cost of the remaining two phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To determine the total number of players in both teams, we need to calculate the number of players in Zeke's team and add it to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Carlton's team has 13 players. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can find the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to the number of players in Carlton's team.

The number of players in Zeke's team is 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To determine the total number of wooden slats needed for the fence, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the garden is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to calculate the total number of oranges she had initially and then subtract the number she kept for herself.

First, let's find out how many oranges she had initially. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

Next, she gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges given away is 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges given away from the total number of oranges: 240 - 80 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to purchase.

The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

The total cost of the items is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can find the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford his books."
"To determine the number of cherries Jerry has, we first need to find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's share by subtracting 10 from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract 50 from 60: 60 - 50 = 10.

Since Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total earnings from the fundraiser, we need to calculate the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both Saturday and Sunday.

Let's start by analyzing the information given. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. We also know that he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. This means the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is 11.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which is 15 boxes. We are also told that he sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day. The cost of gingerbread is $6 per box, and the cost of apple pie is $15 per box.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

To find the total earnings for the two days, we add the earnings from Saturday and Sunday.

Total earnings for two days = 225 + 315 = 540.

"As a health expert, I can advise that reapplying sunscreen is crucial for maintaining adequate protection against the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. When determining the amount of sunscreen needed, it's essential to consider the frequency of application and the duration of exposure.

Given that Pamela reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. Over the course of 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen a total of 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each application requires 1 ounce of sunscreen, so the total amount needed is 32 ounces. Since each bottle contains 8 ounces, we can calculate the number of bottles required by dividing the total amount needed by the amount in each bottle.

32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles

Therefore, to ensure adequate sun protection, Pamela should pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her 8-day vacation.

The final answer is: 4"
"When comparing the prices of two vehicles, it's essential to understand the relationship between their costs. In this case, we're told that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. 

To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100. 

First, we calculate the discount: 40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40.

Now, we subtract the discount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car: $100 - $40 = $60.

So, the price of the red car is $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add their prices together: $100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother, we need to determine their current ages. 

First, let's consider Emil's brother's age. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old at that time. Since Emil is currently 19, his brother is 12 - 5 = 7 years old now.

Next, we need to find Emil's dad's current age. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old at that time. Since Emil is currently 19, his dad is 48 - 5 = 43 years old now.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

"To determine the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players in the class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this by multiplying 0.2 by the total number of students, which is 30.

0.2 * 30 = 6 students

Now, we need to find the number of students who are not football players. This is the remaining 80% of the class, which is 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Next, we need to find the number of cheerleaders or band members. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or band members, we can calculate this by multiplying 0.25 by the number of non-football players, which is 24.

0.25 * 24 = 6 students

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students

"To determine the total cost of filling Pat's flower bed, we need to calculate the number of plants she can fit in the bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant requires 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant, as well as its own width of 12 inches (1 foot). 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Next, we need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 1.5 feet is equivalent to 18 inches. The total space required for each plant is 12 inches (plant width) + 18 inches (space between plants) = 30 inches.

Now, we can calculate the total number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. The total space available is 1332 inches, and each plant requires 30 inches of space. 

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers. Each flower costs $6 at the store.

The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower: 27 * 6 = 162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the daily pretzel consumption of Edgar's brother, we need to calculate half of Edgar's daily consumption. Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so his brother eats 1/2 of that amount.

1/2 of 18 = 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total pretzel consumption for the week by multiplying the daily amount by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to consider the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias. Each petunia costs $3.00, and Katherine wants to add 3 petunias to each of the 5 baskets. So, the total cost of petunias is 5 * 3 * $3.00 = $45.00.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of sweet potato vines. Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50, and Katherine wants to add 2 vines to each of the 5 baskets. So, the total cost of sweet potato vines is 5 * 2 * $2.50 = $25.00.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the other flowers.

For the sunflowers, 4 plants require 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil. 
For the carnations, 10 plants require 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the amount of soil left for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, with 3 pounds of soil available, they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate her monthly savings and then multiply it by the number of months in a year.

First, let's find out how much she sets aside each month. 25% of her monthly income is set aside for fancy shoes. Her monthly income is $2,000.00. 

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she saves $500.00 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year to find the total savings in a year: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we need to divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both tasks simultaneously. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by her peeling rate: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 3 times 10 minutes, which equals 30 minutes.

Since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the final temperature of the room, we need to consider the effects of the air conditioner and the room's natural temperature increase.

The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. It warms the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour when not in use.

The air conditioner was initially set to low for 3 hours, resulting in a cooling effect of 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. Then, it was switched to high for 4 hours, resulting in a cooling effect of 4 * 3 = 12 degrees. The total cooling effect during this period is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room also warmed up by 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours. Therefore, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees during this time.

The net cooling effect is the difference between the total cooling effect and the warming effect, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to understand the relationship between the ages of Bill and his father.

Let's denote the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet as 'x'. Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, Bill's age at that time is 3x.

The comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so the time difference between the two sightings is 75 years. This means that the age difference between Bill's age at the second sighting and his father's age at the first sighting is 75 years.

We can set up the equation: 3x - x = 75, where 3x is Bill's age at the second sighting and x is his father's age at the first sighting.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = 75.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 37.5.

Since Bill's father was 30 years old when he saw the comet, we can find Bill's age at that time by subtracting 37.5 from 30, but that is not what we are looking for. We are looking for Bill's age when his father was 30. 

We know that the comet orbits every 75 years, so the time between the two sightings is 75 years. Therefore, Bill's age when his father was 30 is 75 years before Bill's age at the second sighting. 

Bill's age at the second sighting is 3x = 3 * 37.5 = 112.5. 

So, Bill's age when his father was 30 is 112.5 - 75 = 37.5 years old.

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Since the comet orbits every 75 years, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is 75 years before his father's age at the second sighting. 

Bill's age at the second sighting is 112.5. 

So, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is 112.5 - 75 = 37.5 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{37.5}$"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check.

Buford writes a check for his electric bill once a month, which translates to 12 checks per year. Similarly, he writes a check for his gas bill once a month, resulting in 12 checks per year.

He also writes checks to the church twice a month, which amounts to 24 checks per year. Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service every quarter, equating to 4 checks per year.

To find the total number of checks, we add the checks from each category: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"The howling patterns of the three wolves in the forest are quite fascinating. Let's break down their howling times to determine the combined length of their nightly serenades.

Tobias, the first wolf, howls for 20 seconds each time. Chikote, on the other hand, howls for twice as long as Tobias, which means Chikote's howls last for 40 seconds.

Now, let's consider Igneous, the third wolf. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. Since Tobias howls for 20 seconds and Chikote howls for 40 seconds, Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

To find the total howling time, we need to add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we can calculate the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the age of Wilfred, we need to consider the total age of the children and the relationship between Helene's age and the average age of the group.

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. The total age of the children is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. 

The total age of the children can be expressed as: 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + Helene's age + W = 20

Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)

We can simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((3 + 4 + Helene's age + W) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + W)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
3 + 4 + (7 + W) + W = 20
12 + 2W = 20
2W = 8
W = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

However, the lawyer will only consider the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, not the $200 donated by Walter's friend. Therefore, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 is still $2000.

The lawyer will donate 3 times this amount, which is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To determine the number of people in the church next door, we need to calculate the total number of cookies given to the church. Since each guest at the wedding brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church as a thank you for their help. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received.

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"When dividing a watermelon among a family of 6, with 2 adults and 4 kids, it's essential to consider the nutritional needs of each family member. In this scenario, each adult requires a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. If we allocate the watermelon in a way that each kid gets x units, then each adult would receive 2x units.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids would be 4x (4 kids * x units each), and the total amount given to the adults would be 2x (2 adults * 2x units each). Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Solving for x, we get 6x = 100. Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 33.33"
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, Doctor Jones has 1 hour left to update his records.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to consider the total time required for each step of the process.

First, let's break down the time needed for each task:

- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours (120 minutes)
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up the total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required from the desired serving time to find the latest start time.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, let's analyze the given information. Lisa and Peter sold a combined total of 64 chocolate bars. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. The total number of chocolate bars sold by Lisa and Peter can be expressed as 3.5x + 4.5x. 

Combining like terms, we get 8x. Since they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars, we can set up the equation 8x = 64.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the costs associated with renting the studio and the number of students attending each session.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, which translates to 12 sessions in a month, assuming a 4-week month. The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and with 10 students, the total cost per student per session is $1.50. Therefore, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

To find the total earnings, we multiply the cost per session by the number of sessions in a month: $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"To determine the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha, we need to first calculate the number of chocolate bars in each box for both individuals.

Let's start by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes for each person. 

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we can find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the population of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to consider the reproductive rate of the female porcupines. Given that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate their number as follows:

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. With 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we add the initial population to the number of babies born.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

The population of porcupines in the park after a year will be 98."
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool's dimensions are 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. 

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular pool is length * width * depth. 

Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow sticks first.

There are 9 red sticks. 
There are 5 more blue sticks than red, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.
The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks to find the total number of sticks: 
9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the difference in the distances traveled by Matteo and Shandy, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covered.

Matteo's speed is 55 miles per hour, and he traveled for 4 hours. To find his total distance, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

Shandy's speed is 45 miles per hour, and he traveled for 10 hours. To find his total distance, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. This can be calculated as follows: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is: 230"
"To determine the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the student population based on age and gender.

First, let's consider the students over 16 years old. Since half of the total students are over 16, we have 3000 / 2 = 1500 students in this age group.

Next, we know that one-fourth of the students over 16 are male. This means 1500 / 4 = 375 students are male, leaving 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.

Now, let's consider the students under 16 years old. Since the other half of the total students are under 16, we also have 3000 / 2 = 1500 students in this age group.

We are told that one-half of the students under 16 are male, which means 1500 / 2 = 750 students are male, leaving 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of laps each person can run, let's analyze the given information.

First, we know that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. 

Trey's running ability is 4 laps more than Bethany's, which means Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn's running ability is half of Trey's, so she can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn's running ability is 2 laps less than Shaelyn's, which means Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, let's compare Bethany's running ability to Quinn's. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. Therefore, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

The amount of water remaining in the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To determine the initial charge of Maria's power bank, we need to analyze the information provided. We know that the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours, and then it loses 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. After this period, the charge remaining is 28%.

Let's break down the problem step by step. For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% after the last 3 hours. To find the charge remaining after 8 hours, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the charge remaining after 8 hours is y. Then, the charge lost in the last 3 hours is y - 28%. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

So, we can set up the equation: y - 28% = 6%.

Solving for y, we get y = 34%.

Now, we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%. We also know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%. To find the initial charge, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the first 5 hours.

The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 34% = 21%.

So, we can set up the equation: x - 21% = 34%.

Solving for x, we get x = 55%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 55%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save for a down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to consider her total weekly earnings. As a waitress, she earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, making her total hourly earnings $25.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

To calculate the down payment amount, we need to find 20% of the car's cost. 20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we can determine the number of weeks she needs to work by dividing the down payment amount by her weekly earnings.

$2000 / $1000 = 2

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate his remaining budget after purchasing the other fruits. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of sweets each friend received, we first need to calculate the total number of packs given away. Since Anne kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

These 13 packs were then distributed equally among 10 friends. To find out how many packs each friend received, we divide the total packs given away by the number of friends: 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Now, we need to convert the 0.3 packs into the actual number of sweets. Since each pack contains 60 sweets, 0.3 packs would be 0.3 * 60 = 18 sweets.

Therefore, each friend received 1 pack (60 sweets) + 0.3 packs (18 sweets) = 78 sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"As a health expert, I'd like to emphasize the importance of a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, such as carrots, which are rich in essential vitamins and minerals. However, the price of carrots can be a concern for many consumers.

To determine the price of carrots after three years, we need to consider the annual increase of 5% of the original price. Let's calculate the price after three years.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies Olivia had, we need to calculate the number of pictures in each album. 

Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and put the same number into 8 albums, we can find the number of pictures per album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, let's consider the albums. Olivia had 3 albums of selfies and 2 albums of portraits. The remaining albums are not specified, but we can find the number of remaining albums by subtracting the number of selfies and portrait albums from the total number of albums.

8 albums - 3 selfies albums - 2 portrait albums = 3 albums

These 3 albums are not specified, but we can assume they are either selfies or portraits. However, since the question asks for the number of portraits and selfies, we can calculate the number of portraits and selfies by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

Number of selfies: 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies
Number of portraits: 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits

However, we also need to consider the remaining 3 albums. If these albums are also selfies, the total number of selfies would be 27 + 3 * 9 = 48. If these albums are portraits, the total number of portraits would be 18 + 3 * 9 = 39.

Since the question does not specify the remaining albums, we have two possible answers:

A) 27 selfies and 18 portraits
B) 48 selfies and 39 portraits

However, since the question asks for the number of portraits and selfies, we can choose the option that is most likely to be correct based on the information provided. In this case, we can choose option A) 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the time James spends reading, we need to calculate how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

James reads 18 pages in total. Since he reads 3 pages per set, we divide 18 by 3 to find the number of sets: 18 / 3 = 6 sets.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we multiply the number of sets by the time per set: 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, let's break down the events of the day.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, which means they will be leaving later, but for now, we'll consider the 76 guests who checked out early.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. So, 30 new guests arrived.

Now, we add these new guests to the remaining guests: 76 + 30 = 106.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, bringing the total to 106 + 7 = 113.

The hotel now has 113 guests."
"When it comes to maintaining a balanced diet, it's essential to understand the nutritional value of the foods we consume. Bananas are a great source of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. However, the question at hand is about the quantity of bananas John has.

Let's break down the information provided: John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday, 6 bananas on Thursday, and triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday on Friday. To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to calculate the bananas he picked on each day.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, John picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, John picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas he picked on each day: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

To maintain a healthy diet, it's essential to consume bananas in moderation. A daily intake of 22 bananas is excessive and may lead to an imbalance of essential nutrients. However, for the sake of this calculation, the total number of bananas John has is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine how many points Aries is sure to get in a 60-item quiz, we need to break down the types of questions and her performance on each.

First, let's calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:
- Total questions: 60

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to establish the relationship between the number of small and large stuffed animals sold. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.

Next, we need to consider the pricing of the stuffed animals. Each small stuffed animal costs $4, and each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, which is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Since x = 2y, we can substitute this into the equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120. Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"When it comes to calculating the total number of sandwiches a family consumes in a week, we need to consider the daily intake of each family member. 

A typical adult male consumes around 5 sandwiches per day, while a female adult consumes approximately 4 sandwiches per day. Children, on the other hand, require fewer sandwiches, with a daily intake of about 2 sandwiches.

Assuming the family consists of one adult male, one adult female, and one child, we can calculate their total daily sandwich consumption as follows:

- Adult male: 5 sandwiches/day
- Adult female: 4 sandwiches/day
- Child: 2 sandwiches/day

Total daily consumption: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches/day

To find the total number of sandwiches consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:

11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week

Therefore, this family consumes a total of 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To determine how much money Suzanne has left, we need to consider her total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes, and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies. If she sold 80 cookies at $1 each, her earnings from cookies would be 80 * $1 = $80.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes. If she sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, her earnings from cupcakes would be 60 * $4 = $240.

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we need to consider the total number of eggs and the number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since the Smith twins each found 30 eggs, the total number of eggs found by them is 30 * 2 = 60.

There are 10 eggs that were not found by anyone. To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we subtract the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to calculate their daily ore production and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. With a bare hand, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day. Using an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

Now, let's calculate the ore production with a steel pickaxe. A steel pickaxe allows the dwarf to mine 50% more ore than an iron pickaxe. Fifty percent of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. Therefore, with a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

To find the daily ore production of 40 dwarves, we multiply the individual production by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds per day.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply the daily production by 30 to find the monthly production: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43200 pounds of ore in a month.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price ratio between the first two packages. The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6.

We can calculate the price per sandwich for the first package by dividing the price by the number of sandwiches: $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Similarly, for the second package, the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, we can use the price per sandwich to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. Multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the monthly payment for the bedroom set, we need to calculate the remaining balance after Tom sells his old bedroom set and then find 10% of that amount.

First, let's find the remaining balance:

Total cost of bedroom set: $3000

Remaining balance: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to calculate 10% of the remaining balance to find the monthly payment:

Remaining balance: $2000
Interest rate: 10% = 0.10
Monthly payment: $2000 * 0.10 = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, let's break down the events step by step.

First, we need to consider the initial number of balloons: 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow. 

When a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst, we calculate the number of red balloons that burst as 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10. This leaves 15 red balloons.

Next, the loud sound startled Sally, causing her to release half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 6 yellow balloons.

As Sally approached the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree. She then added 75% of these blue balloons to her remaining clutch. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 0.75 by 8, which equals 6. This means she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school. We have 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. Adding these together gives us a total of 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

The probability of not having to turn in his homework is 102% - 100% = 2%. However, this is not possible since the probability cannot be greater than 100%. To find the correct answer, we need to subtract the probability of the three scenarios from 100%: 100% - 50% - 40% - 12% = -2%. However, this is not possible since the probability cannot be negative. To find the correct answer, we need to add 100% to -2%: 100% - 2% = 98%.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 98%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate can receive, we need to calculate the available seating in the Fine Arts Center after accounting for reserved seats.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, the remaining tickets are for guests, implying that each graduate can give out the calculated number of tickets to their friends and family.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the equivalent number of small beans for the amount of large and medium-sized beans he can consume.

First, let's consider the large beans. It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we need to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can set up a proportion to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans.

Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Then, 3x = 150 (since 3 small beans = 1 medium-sized bean). 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small jelly beans.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine Melissa's hourly pay after expenses, we need to consider her total earnings and total expenses. 

First, let's calculate her total earnings: 3 days * $15 per day = $45. 

Next, we need to calculate her total expenses: 3 days * $3 per day = $9.

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, we need to find out her total hours worked: 
Total hours = 6 hours per day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses:
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to consider his new income after college.

Before college, Jim earned $25,000 per year. After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

The total amount of money Jim needs to earn is the sum of the loans he took and the money he lost by not working while in college. This is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at his new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine the total area of fabric Jim needs for his comforter, we must first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. To create the fabric pieces, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width of the bed.

The new dimensions of the fabric pieces are 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric by multiplying the length and width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces, we multiply this area by 2 to get the total area: 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The total area of fabric Jim needs to buy is 160 square feet."
"To determine the total number of letters delivered by the post office from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. One-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday is 425 / 5 = 85. 
Then, we add 17 to this amount to find the total number of letters delivered on Tuesday: 85 + 17 = 102.

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204.

"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier's height can be calculated by converting his height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches. Adding the 3 inches he grew over the summer, Xavier's current height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole's height is given as 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer. Therefore, Cole's current height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The first person's share is $420."
"To determine the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Next, we need to convert 3/8ths of a day to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

Therefore, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010. 

The initial price of the car is $20,000, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * depreciation rate)
= $12,472 - ($12,472 * 0.21)
= $12,472 - $2,620.32

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out her daily water intake in gallons, we'll divide the number of cups by the number of cups in a gallon. 

There are 16 cups in a gallon. 
So, 8 cups/day ÷ 16 cups/gallon = 0.5 gallons/day.

To find out her total water intake in 30 days, we'll multiply her daily intake by the number of days.

0.5 gallons/day * 30 days = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, let's break down the events step by step.

Initially, we have 120 people on the train. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, increasing the total to 140.

At the second stop, 50 people get off the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. This results in a total of 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people on the train.

Finally, at the third stop, 80 people get off the train, leaving us with a total of 190 - 80 = 110 people on the train.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"When it comes to athletic gear, it's essential to prioritize both comfort and performance. To determine the total cost of Alison's purchases, let's break down the expenses.

First, we have the tank top, which costs $10. Next, the running shorts are $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $15. Moving on, the tennis shoes were originally priced at $48 but were on sale for half price, which brings the cost down to $24. Lastly, the athletic socks cost $8, and with a $2 discount from the coupon, the final price is $6.

Now, let's calculate the total cost by adding up the expenses:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

The final answer is: $55"
"To determine the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"When it comes to health insurance, it's essential to consider the increased costs associated with accidents. In James' case, his insurance premium has increased by 60% due to the accident. 

To calculate the new premium, we need to determine the amount of the increase. Sixty percent of the normal cost of $120 is calculated as follows:

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Adding this increase to the normal cost, we get:

Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James needs to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply it by 12 to get the annual premium:

Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

Therefore, James pays $2304 per year for his insurance."
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to consider the total number of sheets he washes and the capacity of his laundry machine.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds require 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed requires 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. 
They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, so they watch 4 / 2 = 2 movies on Sunday.

In one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

The total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks is 24."
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to consider the stickers he collected over the past three years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers, bringing his total to 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. 
So, this year he has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 250 = 500 stickers.

The final answer is: 500"
"To determine how long 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate their daily food consumption. Since each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, their total daily consumption is 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams per cat.

For 3 cats, the total daily consumption would be 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams per day.

Now, let's divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily consumption (360 grams): 720 / 360 = 2.

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"To determine the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we need to consider the information provided.

First, let's establish the total number of slices available. Since each pizza has 8 slices and there are 4 pizzas, the total number of slices is 8 * 4 = 32.

Now, let's analyze the eating habits of the individuals involved. Becky ate 10 slices. It's mentioned that she ate 3 more slices than Jake, which means Jake consumed 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia's eating habits are also noteworthy. She ate twice as many slices as Jake, so her total is 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to add up the slices consumed by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the time Betsy's part of the meal took, we need to consider the total time it took to make the meal, which is 98 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can represent the time Donovan's part took as x. Therefore, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time equation can be written as:
x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan's part took, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal took 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"When calculating the total cost of a doctor's visit, it's essential to consider all the associated expenses. In Hannah's case, the costs include the cast, the doctor's visit, painkillers, and parking.

The cost of the cast is a straightforward $200. The doctor's visit is charged at $300 per hour, but since the visit is only 30 minutes, we need to calculate the cost for half an hour. This comes out to $300 * 0.5 = $150.

For pain management, Hannah requires 30 painkillers at $4 each, resulting in a total cost of $4 * 30 = $120.

Lastly, the parking fee is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, which amounts to $6 * 2 = $12.

To find the total cost, we add these expenses together: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate the number of emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of his daily emails are non-responsive, which is equivalent to 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails.

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

In a 5-day work week, James responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited the Science Center. 
On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited, which is 2 * 32 = 64 classes.
On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, which is 3 * 32 = 96 classes.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited the Science Center.
On Friday, 25 classes visited the Science Center.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

The total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 207."
"To calculate John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to consider the scores he received. His scores are 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, let's add up these scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 0.7 by 20, which equals 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To calculate the total cost of postage for Anthony's pizza parlor coupons, we need to consider the number of small and big coupons he wants to send out.

Anthony plans to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of small and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

Converting cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The total cost of postage for Anthony's pizza parlor coupons is $245.

The final answer is: $245"
"To determine the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we need to calculate the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches after Mark ate some and Sidney ordered more.

Initially, let's find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Since he ordered 3 less than ten, we subtract 3 from 10.

10 - 3 = 7

Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

7 * 4 = 28

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, there were 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left. Sidney ordered 3 more sub sandwiches. 

3 + 3 = 6

Now, there are 6 meatball sub sandwiches left. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

6 * 4 = 24

The total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 24."
"To determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to first calculate the number of trucks that were unable to deliver due to mechanical failures.

A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, which means 1/4 of 20 trucks were affected. To find this number, we multiply 20 by 1/4.

20 * (1/4) = 5

This means 5 trucks were unable to deliver the fertiliser. To find the number of trucks that were able to deliver, we subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks.

20 - 5 = 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that delivered by the tons per truck.

15 * 20 = 300

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 300 tons.

The final answer is: 300"
"To determine the cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion offered by the grocery store. The promotion states that for every pound of butter purchased, the second pound is half off.

Since Dennis requires 6 pounds of butter, we can break this down into sets of 2 pounds. For each set of 2 pounds, he pays the full price of $4.00 for one pound and half off for the other pound, which is $2.00.

To calculate the total cost, we multiply the number of sets by the cost of each set. There are 3 sets of 2 pounds in 6 pounds.

- Cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter: 
  - 3 sets * $4.00 (full price) = $12.00
  - 3 sets * $2.00 (half off) = $6.00
- Total cost for 6 pounds of butter = $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To determine the total cost of Kayla's party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and multiply it by the cost per guest, then add the initial fee.

First, let's find the total number of guests attending the party. Kayla invited her 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they could not come. So, the total number of guests attending is 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. The number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost per additional guest is $6. To find the total cost for the additional guests, we multiply the number of additional guests by the cost per guest: 21 * 6 = $126.

Now, we add the initial fee to the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost: $126 + $125 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of fractions and percentages. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is equivalent to 25% or 1/4. This means she has 3/4 of her money left. Riza, on the other hand, spent one-third of her money, which is equivalent to 33.33% or 1/3. This means she has 2/3 of her money left.

Let's calculate the amount of money Maggie has left: 3/4 * $60 = $45.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Riza has left: 2/3 * $60 = $40.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have: $45 + $40 = $85.

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to consider the daily consumption of the first two monkeys. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, while the second monkey consumes 4 more bananas than the first, which is 14 bananas per day.

The total number of bananas the first two monkeys eat each day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas. Since the total number of bananas is 315 and they last for a week (7 days), we can find the total daily consumption by dividing 315 by 7: 315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total daily consumption: 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: 21"

"To determine how many quarters Jenny leaves with after buying roses, we need to calculate the total cost of the flowers and the change she receives.

Roses cost $2 each, but it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen, which is $15 for 12 roses. Since Jenny bought 15 roses, she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses. 

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

The final answer is: 16"
"To calculate the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to consider the sales of each item. 

First, let's calculate the revenue from milkshakes. If Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, the total revenue from milkshakes is 6 x $5.50 = $33.

Next, we'll calculate the revenue from burger platters. If Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, the total revenue from burger platters is 9 x $11 = $99.

Lastly, we'll calculate the revenue from sodas. If Terry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, the total revenue from sodas is 20 x $1.50 = $30.

Now, let's add the total revenue from each item together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to break down the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to calculate her current total and then find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. Over 12 weeks, she would have saved:
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since the sculpture requires 200 toothpicks, and she already has 120, she needs 80 more toothpicks:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the required 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch, we need to calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is:
2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:
1500 * 1.2 = $1800

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price he paid:
2000 - 1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
(200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish per second.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, and there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72,000.

"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in both scenarios.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

"To determine the amount of fence left over for Sam, we need to find out how much fence each person gets. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet. We can set up an equation to represent this: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

This means Sam gets 20 feet of fence. Since they have 100 feet in total, to find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total: 100 - 20 = 80.

However, the question asks how much is left over for Sam, implying that we need to find the amount of fence left after both Sam and Harry have taken their portions. Since Sam gets 20 feet, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 80 feet. The total amount of fence taken is 20 + 80 = 100. This means there is no fence left over for Sam, as they have used up the entire 100 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$"
"To determine the rate at which a crocodile grows, we need to consider its growth pattern over time. Given that it grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate its annual growth rate.

The annual growth rate can be calculated by dividing the total growth by the number of years it took to achieve that growth.

Annual growth rate = Total growth / Number of years
Annual growth rate = 8 inches / 4 years
Annual growth rate = 2 inches/year

Now, we can use this annual growth rate to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Annual growth rate * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is: 26"

"To determine the total time John spends learning each week, we need to consider his regular class schedule and the additional time he dedicates to learning on the weekends.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends in class during the week. Assuming a standard 6-period day with each period lasting 40 minutes, we can calculate the total minutes spent in class per day as follows: 
6 periods * 40 minutes per period = 240 minutes per day

Since John attends classes for 5 days a week, we can calculate the total minutes spent in class per week: 
240 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1200 minutes per week

In addition to his regular classes, John takes 2 extra classes, each lasting 40 minutes. We can calculate the total minutes spent in these extra classes per day as follows: 
2 classes * 40 minutes per class = 80 minutes per day

For the entire week, the total minutes spent in these extra classes would be: 
80 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 400 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes spent in regular classes and extra classes: 
1200 minutes per week + 400 minutes per week = 1600 minutes per week

John also dedicates time to learning on the weekends. He spends 1/16 of his total weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. To calculate this, we first need to determine his total weekly minutes. 
There are 7 days in a week, with each day consisting of 24 hours and 60 minutes per hour. 
7 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 1680 minutes per week

Now, we can calculate the minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday: 
1/16 * 1680 minutes per week = 105 minutes per day
105 minutes per day * 2 days = 210 minutes per week

Adding this to his regular and extra class time, we get: 
1600 minutes per week + 210 minutes per week = 1810 minutes per week

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 
1810 minutes per week / 60 minutes per hour = 30.17 hours per week

Therefore, John spends approximately 30.17 hours per week learning.

The final answer is: 30.17"
"To determine the height of the bouncy ball after its second bounce, we need to consider the height of the initial drop and the bouncing pattern.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

Since the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce, we can calculate the height after the first bounce by multiplying the initial height by 2/3.

Height after the first bounce = 72 * (2/3) = 48 feet

Now, we can calculate the height after the second bounce by multiplying the height after the first bounce by 2/3.

Height after the second bounce = 48 * (2/3) = 32 feet

Therefore, the height of the ball on its second bounce is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child step by step.

First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To calculate the total earnings of the apple orchard, we need to determine the number of bags of apples sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To determine the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms left after the Allosaurus ate. 

First, we know that the Allosaurus ate half of what the velociraptors had. This means the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. The velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate. Therefore, the T-Rex ate 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining options.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas, but she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. She then shook 3 of them, making 3 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 8 sodas in total, with 2 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 2 / 8
Probability = 0.25

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = 0.25 * 100
Probability = 25%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"When analyzing the movement of two trains departing from a station in opposite directions, we need to consider their individual speeds and the time elapsed. 

One train is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour, while the other is traveling at half that distance per hour, which is 30 miles per hour.

To determine the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we calculate the distance each train has traveled. The first train, traveling at 60 miles per hour, covers a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles in 3 hours.

The second train, traveling at 30 miles per hour, covers a distance of 30 * 3 = 90 miles in the same time frame.

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of the distances they have traveled, which is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To determine the total number of people Billy helps, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to volunteer. 

First, let's find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, multiply the number of days Billy helps by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he helps: 
40 * 6 = 240

"To determine Jeff's age, we need to establish the age of his sister, Martha. Since Martha is 4 years younger than her boyfriend, Mike, who is 24 years old, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can calculate Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age, as Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

"To determine the distance Ahito ran, we need to calculate the total distance covered by Micah. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance by multiplying 8 by 3.5.

Micah's distance = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance covered by all three individuals is 52 miles. To find Ahito's distance, we can subtract the combined distance covered by Amber and Micah from the total distance.

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to consider the sequence of transactions.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item. 

The initial charge was $85.00, and after returning the item, the balance is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20, which equals $4.00. Therefore, the price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 0.10, which equals $3.00. Therefore, the price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00.

Finally, we add the total cost of the new purchases to the previous balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To determine the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we need to consider the information provided. 

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 
A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, which means the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. 

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine Caroline's age, we need to establish the age relationships between the three individuals. We know that Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age by doubling Chris's age.

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3, as Caroline is three times older than Ben.

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work for retirement, we need to consider her savings rate and the amount she needs to save for a 20-year retirement period.

Lauren's annual salary is $100,000, and she saves 20% of it. This means her annual savings is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

In retirement, Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year. Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

To calculate how many years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of $20,000 per year, we use the formula: Total savings needed / Annual savings. This gives us $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Since Lauren has not worked any years yet, the total number of years she needs to work to save for retirement is the answer.

"To determine the number of girls in the school, we first need to find the total number of students. Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can calculate the total number of students by dividing the number of boys by the percentage of boys.

First, we convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40% = 40/100 = 0.4

Then, we divide the number of boys by this decimal: 240 / 0.4 = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

"As a health expert, I'd like to emphasize the importance of regular visits to family members, especially for mental well-being. However, let's focus on the physical aspect of John's trips to his parents.

To calculate the total distance John drives in a month, we need to consider the round trip. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive to his parents at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the one-way distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

For a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

Considering John's regular visits to his parents, it's essential to maintain a healthy driving routine, including regular breaks, proper vehicle maintenance, and a balanced diet to combat fatigue."

"To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in a 10-hour shift.

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
Two other workers produce 4 toys per hour, so their combined production rate is 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
The combined production rate of these four workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour. 
In a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by these four workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to fulfill the order, the total number of toys required is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. 
The fifth worker must have produced the remaining 420 - 200 = 220 toys in the 10-hour shift.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we need to find out how many small bags can be filled with these M&M's. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's, so we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can fill 90 small bags with M&M's.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie the albatross to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to consider his daily flight distance and the total distance he needs to cover.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance would be 20,000 kilometers.

Given that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can calculate the number of days required to cover 20,000 kilometers by dividing the total distance by his daily flight distance.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to establish a hierarchy of speeds based on the given information. 

First, we know the average car can travel at 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so its speed is 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we are told the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the fastest car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25: 600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour.

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To determine Vince's current age, we need to consider Liam's age and the age difference between them two years ago. 

Liam is currently 16 years old. Two years ago, his age was 14 years old. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice the age of Vince, we can calculate Vince's age two years ago by dividing Liam's age two years ago by 2. 

Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9.

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can say A = M.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so C + S = 30.

We also know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so C = S + 12.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S + 12 + S = 30, which simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to consider the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Next, we need to find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 200 crayons, we can determine the number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. With 25 boxes, each weighing 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the total amount John makes from selling the planks, we need to calculate the number of logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we first find 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Next, we divide the total feet of usable wood by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by 5 to find the total number of planks.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

Now, we calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate their individual earnings and then sum them up.

Valerie's monthly earnings are $5000. Her brother earns twice as much as Valerie, which is 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother's earnings are twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to consider her walking speeds on both the beach and the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, we can calculate her speed on each surface. Let's assume her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Given that she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The time spent on the beach can be calculated as distance/speed = 2/x. This is equal to 40 minutes. So, 2/x = 40.

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Next, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we need to calculate her current savings and the remaining amount she needs to save.

Jane saves $4 per week. Over 8 weeks, her total savings would be:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

To find the remaining amount she needs to save, we subtract her current savings from the target amount:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of marbles Bob has and then calculate how many marbles he will have after losing 10.

Let's start by considering the information that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. This means that before receiving 2 dozen more marbles, Bob had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 36: 36 - 10 = 26.

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.

"As a health expert, I'd like to approach this problem from a practical perspective. When it comes to drinking water, temperature plays a significant role in our comfort and safety. 

Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees, which suggests that he's sensitive to cold temperatures. When he pours 4 ounces of water from a 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from an unknown temperature into his water bottle, he's able to drink the water. This implies that the combined temperature of the two mugs is sufficient to meet his minimum drinking temperature requirement.

To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the average temperature of the two mugs. The average temperature is calculated by adding the temperatures of the two mugs and dividing by 2. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2.

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle).

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5. Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40. Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 / 2 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 >= 80
165 + 5x >= 80
5x >= 80 - 165
5x >= -85
x >= -85 / 5
x >= -17

However, since x represents a temperature, it cannot be negative. Therefore, the minimum value of x is 40 degrees.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Now, we can find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks by adding the total number of cows and chickens.

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

"When it comes to purchasing bagels in bulk, it's essential to consider the overall cost per unit to ensure you're getting the best value for your money. In this case, Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, each containing 9 bagels, at a cost of $10.00 per pack.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels. This can be done by multiplying the cost of one pack by the number of packs ordered.
Total cost = 4 packs * $10.00 per pack = $40.00

Now, let's consider the 10% discount Russell receives on his order. To find the discount amount, we'll calculate 10% of the total cost.
Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00

Next, we'll subtract the discount from the total cost to determine the final cost of the bagels.
Final cost = Total cost - Discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, let's calculate the total number of bagels in the 4 packs.
Number of bagels per pack = 9
Total number of bagels = 4 packs * 9 bagels per pack = 36 bagels

To find the cost per bagel, we'll divide the final cost by the total number of bagels.
Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel

"To determine the number of potatoes Gomer consumed, we need to understand the relationship between scoops of mashed potatoes and the number of potatoes required to make them. 

First, let's establish the number of potatoes needed for 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, we calculate this as 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes for 2 scoops.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This means Gomer consumed 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Since 3 potatoes are required to make 2 scoops, we need to find out how many groups of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops. This is calculated as 18 / 2 = 9. 

To find the total number of potatoes Gomer ate, we multiply the number of groups by the number of potatoes per group: 9 * 3 = 27.

Therefore, Gomer consumed 27 potatoes.

"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to consider his daily egg consumption over two periods.

In the first 30 days, Chester consumes 3 eggs per day. This translates to a total of 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Following this, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs per day for the next 30 days. This amounts to 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Combining these two periods, we find that Chester consumes a total of 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs over 60 days.

To convert this to dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12, as 1 dozen equals 12 eggs. Therefore, 240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans, we need to break down the information provided. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. This means the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we need to find the total number of green and red jellybeans. Adding these together, we get 17 + 34 = 51.

To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans. The total number of jellybeans is 60, so 60 - 51 = 9.

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"To determine the total number of sunflowers sold by Faraday, we need to calculate the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets and individual sunflowers separately.

First, let's find out how many bouquets he sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquet per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to get the number of bouquets sold per day.

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 12 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets.

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Next, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold per day from the individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from the sunflowers per day, we can divide $26 by $2 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day.

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can add the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

"To determine the financial loss of Adam's rock stand, we need to consider the total cost of the rocks and the revenue generated from selling 60% of the inventory.

First, let's calculate the total number of rocks Adam can buy with his initial investment of $100. Each rock costs $5, so:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

However, Adam also has to account for the unsold rocks. Since he has 20 rocks in total and sells 12, he has 8 rocks left. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 + $40 = $140

To find the financial loss, we subtract the revenue from the total cost:

$140 - $84 = $56

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which translates to 0.2 in decimal form. The second ticket, being three times more likely to win, has a probability of 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply their individual probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

Expressing this as a percentage, we get 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To determine the number of seashells each person gets, we need to find out how many seashells each of them collected initially. Let's start by analyzing the information given.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. This means Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Now, let's consider the relationship between the number of seashells collected by Carlos and Carrey. We are told that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. If we denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as R, then Carlos collected 2R seashells. Since we know Carlos collected 22 seashells, we can write the equation 2R = 22. Solving for R, we get R = 11.

Now that we know the number of seashells each person collected, we can find the total number of seashells: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60.

To find out how many seashells each person gets when they divide the total number of seashells equally among themselves, we divide the total by 3 (the number of people): 60 / 3 = 20.

"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we need to establish the height of each individual involved. 

Isabel's height is given as 7 feet. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate his height by subtracting 2 feet from Isabel's height.

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Now, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Therefore, we can calculate Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we can calculate its length by dividing Carl's height by 2.

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

"To determine the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to understand that each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. This means that one bottle is equivalent to 1/5 of the daily energy needs of one person.

To cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person, we would need 5 bottles (1/0.20 = 5). 

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

Therefore, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles per day to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final answer is: 7300"
"When analyzing the scenario of Carla's octuplets, we need to consider the distribution of purple and blue clothing among the babies, as well as the addition of bows. 

First, let's determine the number of babies wearing purple and blue. Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the babies in purple and 1/4 in blue, we can calculate these numbers as follows:

Number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2

Next, we need to find the number of babies wearing purple and bows, as well as the total number of babies wearing bows. Since 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, we can calculate these numbers as follows:

Number of babies wearing purple and bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2
Number of babies wearing blue and bows: 2

Total number of babies wearing bows: 2 + 2 = 4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple by dividing the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiplying by 100:

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 50%"
"To determine the number of tax reports received on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total number of reports received on the other days and subtract that from the overall total.

The IRS received a total of 5168 tax reports last week. On Monday and Tuesday, they received 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday, they received 2136 reports.

To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we can subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the overall total.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: 1125"
"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate the amount of land he sold in the first two transactions. He sold half of his 80 square meters for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. 

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 square meters is 20 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine Geb's age, we need to calculate half of Haley's age first. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Now, we need to find Geb's age, which is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. To do this, we subtract 10 from 13.

13 - 10 = 3.

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"When it comes to personal hygiene and protection, it's essential to consider the frequency of face mask changes, especially for individuals who venture out frequently. 

If someone goes out three times a day and changes their face mask two times each time, we need to calculate the total number of face masks used in a 24-hour period. 

To do this, we multiply the number of face mask changes per outing by the number of outings in a day. 

2 face mask changes per outing * 3 outings per day = 6 face masks per day

Now, to determine the total number of face masks used over a 2-day period, we multiply the daily usage by 2.

6 face masks per day * 2 days = 12 face masks

Therefore, the correct answer is 12 face masks used every 2 days."
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and then subtract that from the initial number of eggs hidden.

Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which is 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, which is 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Initially, Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects from and then multiply it by his earnings per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

For an 8-year-old tree, we know it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.

A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can find the production of a 10-year-old tree: x = 1000. 

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000, x = 1200. 

So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 0 + 1000 = 1550

The final answer is: 1550"
"To determine the amount of money Jack has now, we need to calculate the amount Sophia gave him and add it to his initial amount.

Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find this amount, we divide $100 by 5. 

$100 / 5 = $20

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100: $100 + $20 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We are given that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, which can be expressed as R = 4B.

We are also given that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, which can be expressed as B = Y - 7.

Furthermore, we know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, which can be expressed as R + B + Y = 37.

Now, let's substitute R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, which gives us 4B + B + Y = 37. This simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Next, we'll substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, which gives us 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37. This simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to establish the initial amount of money each person had. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa must have been given $15.

Next, let's consider the amount of money they both gave to their little sister. We'll call this amount 'x'. After giving 'x' dollars to their sister, Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.
(15 - x) = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the amount of red paint used in the mural, let's analyze the given information.

We know that the mural consists of four different colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. It's also stated that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. This implies that the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is divided equally among the three colors.

Given that half of the mural is yellow, the other half must be the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, half of it is 6 pints, which represents the combination of red, white, and purple paint.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x. We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedrooms. Each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

Next, we need to find the area of the living room. It's mentioned that the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Now, let's consider the rest of the house. It's given as 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3160}$"
"To determine the total number of clouds Alice counted over the five days, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them up.

Let's start with Monday, where Alice counts 3 clouds. 

On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The total number of clouds Alice counted over the five days is 93."
"When it comes to maintaining a clean and hygienic kitchen, using a dishwasher is an efficient and effective way to sanitize dishes. However, the cost of dishwasher pods can add up over time. 

To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run with a special size box for $1, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the new box. This box has 20% more pods than a regular box of 100. 

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

Therefore, with the new box, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has.

1. Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

4. He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we need to divide the total amount of money by the value of each bill: 300 / 5 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the soccer match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine how many days a teacher can use a piece of chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to consider the rate at which the chalk is used and the point at which it becomes too small to use.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 45% of it on Monday. This leaves 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

The teacher then uses the chalk at a rate of 20% per day. We need to find out how many days the 2.75 inches of chalk will last at this rate.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we need to calculate the total number of students on varsity and then subtract that from the total number of students in the class.

First, let's find the number of girls on varsity. One-third of the 12 girls are on varsity, which is 12 * (1/3) = 4 girls.

Next, we find the number of boys on varsity. One-fourth of the 12 boys are on varsity, which is 12 * (1/4) = 3 boys.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students.

Now, we need to find the total number of students in the class. There are 12 boys and 12 girls, so the total number of students is 12 + 12 = 24.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: 24 - 7 = 17.

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 17.

"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we need to consider the relationship between the number of face masks Mike and Johnny purchased. 

Let's start by identifying the number of face masks Mike bought. We know that Johnny bought 2 more than three times the amount Mike bought. 

If we let 'x' represent the number of face masks Mike bought, then the number of face masks Johnny bought can be expressed as 3x + 2. 

Given that Mike bought 5 face masks, we can substitute x = 5 into the equation to find the number of face masks Johnny bought: 3(5) + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist works on.

The dentist drills 4 teeth, and then caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, the number of teeth the dentist caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

To find the percentage, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, and then multiply by 100.

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."
"To determine the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus needs to return, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total gallons of milk he purchased. 

2/5 of 4000 gallons is calculated as follows: 
(2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons of milk were returned.

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.

Refund = 1600 * 3.5 = 5600

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Wendy's and Colin's ages. Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the given information, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:
W = 5(C + 7)

We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we need to calculate the total number of books he can purchase with the given amount of money. 

First, let's find out the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the total number of books as follows:

Total books = Total money / Cost per 100 books
Total books = $27000 / $500
Total books = 54

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books Bob can buy per school.

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 54 / 3
Books per school = 18

Therefore, Bob can buy 18 books per school.

"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to calculate the number of bags of coal he received and multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, let's find the number of bags of coal. Since the coal is delivered in 50 kg bags, we divide the total weight of coal by the weight per bag:

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, we know the cost per bag is $18. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, which is equivalent to 1/3 snowballs per minute. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 4/60 or 2/30 or 1/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate of snowballs, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: (1/3) - (1/15) = (5/15) - (1/15) = 4/15 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how long it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 4/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the time, we can use the formula: Time = Number of snowballs / Rate = 60 / (4/15) = 60 * (15/4) = 225 minutes.

However, we also need to consider the initial 15 minutes where Jay builds 20 snowballs but 2 melt, leaving him with 18 snowballs. Then, he needs to build 42 more snowballs (60 - 18 = 42) at the net rate of 4/15 snowballs per minute.

Time to build the initial 18 snowballs = 0 minutes (since he already has them)
Time to build the remaining 42 snowballs = 42 / (4/15) = 42 * (15/4) = 157.5 minutes

Total time = 0 + 157.5 = 157.5 minutes

However, this is not the final answer. We need to consider the time it takes for the snowballs to melt. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, and Jay has 18 snowballs, it will take 18/2 = 9 sets of 15 minutes for all the snowballs to melt. 

Time for the snowballs to melt = 9 * 15 = 135 minutes

However, this is the time it takes for the snowballs to melt, not the time it takes for Jay to build the snowballs. We need to add this to the time it takes for Jay to build the remaining snowballs.

Total time = 157.5 + 135 = 292.5 minutes

However, this is still not the final answer. We need to consider the initial 60 minutes where Jay builds 20 snowballs. 

Time to build the initial 20 snowballs = 60 minutes

Total time = 60 + 292.5 = 352.5 minutes

However, this is still not the final answer. We need to consider the time it takes for the snowballs to melt during the initial 60 minutes. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, and Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, it will take 10 sets of 15 minutes for 20 snowballs to melt.

Time for the snowballs to melt during the initial 60 minutes = 10 * 15 = 150 minutes

However, this is the time it takes for the snowballs to melt, not the time it takes for Jay to build the snowballs. We need to subtract this from the initial 60 minutes.

Time to build the initial 20 snowballs = 60 - 150 = -90 minutes (which is not possible, so we will use the initial 60 minutes)

Total time = 60 + 292.5 = 352.5 minutes

However, this is still not the final answer. We need to consider the time it takes for the snowballs to melt during the 292.5 minutes. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, and Jay has 18 snowballs for 157.5 minutes, it will take 157.5/15 = 10.5 sets of 15 minutes for 20.5 snowballs to melt (since 157.5 is not a multiple of 15, we will use 157.5/15 = 10.5, and 10 sets of 15 minutes for 150 snowballs to melt, and 7.5 minutes for 10.5 snowballs to melt).

Time for the snowballs to melt during the 157.5 minutes = 10 * 15 + 7.5 = 150 + 7.5 = 157.5 minutes

However, this is the time it takes for the snowballs to melt, not the time it takes for Jay to build the snowballs. We need to subtract this from the 157.5 minutes.

Time to build the remaining 42 snowballs = 157.5 - 157.5 = 0 minutes (which is not possible, so we will use the 157.5 minutes)

Total time = 60 + 157.5 = 217.5 minutes

However, this is still not the final answer. We need to consider the time it takes for the snowballs to melt during the initial 60 minutes. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, and Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, it will take 10 sets of 15 minutes for 20 snowballs to melt.

Time for the snowballs to melt during the initial 60 minutes = 10 * 15 = 150 minutes

However, this is the time it takes for the snowballs to melt, not the time it takes for Jay to build the snowballs. We need to subtract this from the initial 60 minutes.

Time to build the initial 20 snowballs = 60 - 150 = -90 minutes (which is not possible, so we will use the initial 60 minutes)

"To determine Jim's current age, we need to find his age 20 years ago and then calculate his current age. 

Let's start by finding John's age 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, we subtract 20 from his current age to find his age 20 years ago: 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

Now, we know that John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago. This means Jim's age 20 years ago was half of John's age at that time. So, Jim's age 20 years ago was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

The final answer is: 24"
"When it comes to understanding the consumption of fruits, particularly apples, it's essential to consider the nutritional value and the impact on overall health. In this scenario, we have three individuals consuming apple slices.

Let's break down the information provided: Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 1 more than her, and her brother ate 1 more than her sister. 

To determine the total number of slices consumed, we need to calculate the number of slices each person ate. Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, which is 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, which is 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the number of slices each person ate: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

The total number of slices consumed is 6."
"To determine the initial number of bandages the nurses had, let's analyze the given information.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50. This means they had some initial bandages, which we'll call x. After using 38 bandages, they had x - 38 bandages left. Then, they ordered 50 more, so they had x - 38 + 50 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 28 bandages. So, after the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. Therefore, after the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100 bandages.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This allows us to set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

Therefore, the initial number of bandages the nurses had is 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"When it comes to hair care, it's essential to consider the total cost of the services. In this case, May is getting a haircut and color treatment. The color treatment costs $40. The haircut, on the other hand, is priced at $30 per inch of hair.

May's hair initially measured 10 inches and was cut down to 8 inches. To determine the total cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the difference in length and multiply it by the cost per inch.

Initial length: 10 inches
Final length: 8 inches
Difference in length: 10 - 8 = 2 inches

Cost per inch: $30
Cost for 2 inches: 2 * $30 = $60

Adding the cost of the color: $40
Total cost: $60 + $40 = $100

Therefore, the total cost of May's haircut and color treatment is $100."
"To determine Jen's total earnings, we need to consider her regular pay and attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April. Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

The final answer is: $510"
"To calculate Jason's total earnings, we need to consider the compensation for each task he completed over a two-week period.

For laundry, Jason earned $3.00 for doing it once. 
For cleaning his room, he earned $1.50 for completing the task once.
Taking the trash out twice earned him $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.
Lastly, emptying the dishwasher six times earned him $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up the earnings from all these tasks: $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To determine the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we need to calculate the amount of blood in one shark first. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To determine the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to consider the influx of patrons at different times of the day. 

First, we have the initial 50 people who entered in the morning. Then, 40 more people arrived at 10:00. Following this, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. Lastly, 3 times the number of people who entered in the morning came in, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant by adding up the number of people at each time:
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (lunch) + 150 (evening) = 320

The total number of people who entered the restaurant is 320."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

First, let's consider the number of red pens. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Next, we need to calculate the number of black pens. It's mentioned that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To determine the total cost of John's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles, so the cost per bottle is $600 / 10 = $60.

The number of bottles of cognac is twice the number of bottles of scotch, which is 2 * 10 = 20 bottles.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"The art of community engagement and environmental stewardship is a vital aspect of maintaining a healthy ecosystem. In this context, let's examine the tree-planting campaign undertaken by Mr. Julius. To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees separately.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. Notably, he also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which amounts to 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he increased the number of White Oak trees by 10, resulting in a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. Furthermore, he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which translates to 1/4 * 40 = 10 additional Lodgepole Pine trees. Consequently, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

To determine the total number of trees planted over the two days, we need to sum the White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees:
White Oak: 30
Lodgepole Pine: 90

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the amount of root beer available for each person to drink at the party, we need to consider the total amount of root beer made and the various incidents that occurred.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. However, his children consumed 4 gallons on the first day. This leaves 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, an unfortunate accident occurred, resulting in the loss of 7 gallons. Therefore, the remaining amount is 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

The following day, a friend visited and took 5 gallons, reducing the remaining amount to 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people attended the party and shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person received, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people: 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons.

Considering the importance of moderation in consumption, especially when it comes to sugary drinks like root beer, it's essential to note that excessive consumption can lead to health issues. However, in this scenario, the amount each person received is relatively small.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"To determine the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge, we need to solve the equation 4x + 8 = 40, where x represents the number of coffee mugs.

First, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we need to calculate the number of fish with each type of stripe and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of fish with red stripes. One-third of the total fish have red stripes.

Total fish = 66
Fish with red stripes = Total fish / 3 = 66 / 3 = 22

Next, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes.

Fish without red stripes = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish, which have blue stripes.

Fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * 44 = 20

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with each type of stripe.

Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to consider the initial number of eyeshadow colors she had and the changes that occurred.

Amy initially had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, totaling 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes. Additionally, she had three makeup sets with six eyeshadow colors each, totaling 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one palette, resulting in a loss of 4 eyeshadow colors. This leaves Amy with 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the given information.

First, let's consider the height of Mattison, which is 60 inches. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so its total height is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Next, we know that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, to find the height of the second floor, we subtract the first floor's height from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Finally, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house: 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that team Alphas found 40% of the total 700 shells. To find this number, we calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. 

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"To determine the exercise needs of the last dog, we need to consider the total exercise required for all four dogs and the average exercise per dog. 

The average exercise per dog is 3 miles per day. Since there are four dogs, the total exercise required for all four dogs is 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total exercise required for the first three dogs: 
- Dog 1: 1 mile
- Dog 2: 4 miles
- Dog 3: 3 miles
Total exercise for the first three dogs: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

To find the exercise required for the last dog, we subtract the total exercise of the first three dogs from the total exercise required for all four dogs: 
12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles

Therefore, the last dog needs 4 miles of exercise per day."
"To determine how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the amount he borrowed and then subtract the amount used to pay off his debts.

First, we calculate 40% of the value of his house, which is worth $250,000. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

This is the amount John borrowed. Now, we need to find out how much of this amount he used to pay off his debts. He used 60% of the borrowed amount.

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To find out how much money he had leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the amount borrowed.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To calculate Deandre's earnings from selling the tunas, we need to consider the total weight of the fish and the cost per kilogram. 

First, let's calculate the total weight of the tunas. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Now, we need to find the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the cost per kilogram. 

Cost per kilogram of tuna = $0.50

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"When it comes to maintaining a healthy indoor environment, controlling humidity levels is crucial. A dehumidifier can be an effective tool in removing excess moisture from the air. In this case, Brian's dehumidifier has three settings: low, medium, and high.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. This is a good starting point for mild humidity issues. However, for more severe cases, the medium and high settings are more effective.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which means it removes 2 liters of water per day. This setting is ideal for moderate humidity levels.

The high setting, being the most powerful, removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which translates to 4 liters of water per day. This setting is best suited for severe humidity issues.

Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, 3 days on the medium setting, and 5 days on the high setting. To calculate the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

On the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day for 3 days, which is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

On the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes 2 liters of water per day for 3 days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

On the high setting, the dehumidifier removes 4 liters of water per day for 5 days, which is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

The total amount of water removed is 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"When it comes to water balloon fights, it's essential to stay hydrated and have fun in the sun. To determine the number of balloons thrown, we need to calculate the total number of balloons used.

First, let's find the total number of balloons: 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack is equal to 10 * 30 = 300 balloons.

Next, we subtract the number of balloons left: 300 - 12 = 288.

Therefore, the number of balloons thrown during the water balloon fight is 288."
"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to calculate the amount of each medicine in one dose and then multiply it by 8.

The first medicine is 14 mL, and the second medicine is 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the two medicines: 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate this by dividing Ali's class capacity by 8.

Ali's class capacity is 120 students. 
1/8 of 120 is 120 / 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 
Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

The final answer is: 150"
"To determine the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to first calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. 

The volume of the jar can be calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. To find the total number of jelly beans, we divide the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed. 

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, let's analyze the situation step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, increasing the total to 60. 

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has a capacity of 200 people and currently has 180 people on board. To find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year at a cost of $2 per visit. This results in an annual cost of 3 * $2 = $6. Over 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To find the length of the longer piece of the board, we need to understand the relationship between the two pieces. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs for his meatballs, we need to calculate the total amount of seasoning required based on the number of meatballs he wants to make and the yield of meatballs per pound of ground beef.

Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs, and he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find the total pounds of meat needed, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total seasoning needed.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

"When it comes to pampering oneself, a visit to the salon can be a great way to relax and rejuvenate. In this case, let's consider a basic manicure that starts at $35 and a pedicure that begins at $40. Many salons offer a discount for bundling services, and in this instance, a 20% discount is applied when both services are chosen.

To calculate the discount, we first find 20% of the cost of each service. For the manicure, this is 0.2 * $35 = $7. For the pedicure, it's 0.2 * $40 = $8. The total discount is then $7 + $8 = $15.

After applying the discount, the cost of the manicure is $35 - $7 = $28, and the cost of the pedicure is $40 - $8 = $32. The total cost for both services is $28 + $32 = $60.

Now, let's consider the additional cost of nail art on each of the 10 fingers. This comes out to 10 * $3 = $30.

Therefore, the total cost for the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

"To determine the amount of money Walter received from selling the apples, we need to follow a step-by-step process.

First, let's calculate the number of apples Walter ate. Since he ate 2/5 of the total 60 apples, we can find this by multiplying 60 by 2/5.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Next, we need to calculate the number of apples Walter gave to his sister, which is 25% of the remaining 36 apples.

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

The amount of money he received = 27 * 3 = 81

"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we need to consider his average speed and the total time he traveled.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. Since he traveled for 3 days, we need to calculate the total hours he spent traveling. There are 24 hours in a day, so the total hours traveled is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance covered by multiplying his average speed by the total hours traveled.

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance covered = 3600 km

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

Therefore, the percentage of the distance covered by Michael is 60%.

"To determine the initial number of grapes, let's analyze the situation step by step.

First, Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother then used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes. 

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes. 

Now, their mother used the remaining grapes to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is 36 / 12 = 3 pies. 

The total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes. 

To find the initial number of grapes, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. This is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 36 (by their mother) = 72 grapes.

However, this is not the initial number of grapes. We need to consider that the mother used all the remaining grapes to make 3 pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by the mother is indeed 36. This means that the initial number of grapes is 72 + x, where x is the number of grapes left over. But since the mother used all the remaining grapes, x must be 0.

Therefore, the initial number of grapes is 72 + 0 = 72.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School on that day, we need to consider the number of teachers who were not absent due to illness and the number of substitute teachers who were called in to help.

First, let's calculate the number of teachers who were not sick. This can be found by subtracting the number of teachers who were absent from the total number of teachers at the school.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of teachers sick = 13

Number of teachers not sick = Total number of teachers - Number of teachers sick
= 82 - 13
= 69

Next, we need to add the number of substitute teachers who were called in to help. This will give us the total number of teachers at school that day.

Number of substitute teachers = 9

Total number of teachers at school = Number of teachers not sick + Number of substitute teachers
= 69 + 9

"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first calculate the capacity of each shelf. 

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase: 
Middle shelf 1 + Middle shelf 2 + Bottom shelf + Top shelf = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are needed to hold all of them. 
To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 
110 / 55 = 2.

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To calculate Rose's profit from selling eggs, we need to consider the cost and revenue of the transaction.

First, let's determine the total cost of the eggs. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12

Now, let's find out how many eggs Rose bought in total. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can multiply the number of dozens by 12:

5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Next, we need to determine how many sets of 3 eggs Rose can sell. We can do this by dividing the total number of eggs by 3:

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since Rose sells each set for $1, the total revenue will be:

20 sets * $1/set = $20

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

Therefore, Rose's profit from selling the eggs is $8.

The final answer is: $8"

"When it comes to snacking on beef jerky, it's essential to consider the cost-effectiveness of the product. Let's break down the cost of a bag of beef jerky that contains 30 sticks and is originally priced at $18.00.

If the bag is on sale for $3.00 off, the discounted price would be $15.00. To find the cost per stick, we need to convert the discounted price to cents: $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents.

Now, let's calculate the cost per stick of jerky:
Number of sticks per bag: 30
Cost per bag in cents: 1500
Cost per stick: 1500 / 30 = 50 cents

Therefore, each stick of jerky would cost 50 cents."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out her total required score. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, and the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions right.

70% of 110 is calculated as 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since the first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct, we can calculate the number of correct answers on the first test as 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, to find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of correct answers on the first test from the total required score: 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

"To determine the number of blueberry ice cubes Mary makes, we need to establish a relationship between the strawberry and blueberry cubes. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B.

We know that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be expressed as B = 5S - 4.

Additionally, we are given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116, or S + B = 116.

To find the number of blueberry cubes, we can substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combining like terms, we get 6S - 4 = 116.

Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6S = 120.

Dividing both sides by 6, we get S = 20.

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry ice cubes.

The final answer is: 96"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to consider her performance in basketball. 

First, let's break down her performance into individual components. Ara plays 40 games every year, and her score for every game is 21 points. 

To find the total points scored in a year, we multiply the number of games played by her score per game: 40 games/year * 21 points/game = 840 points/year.

Now, to find the total points scored in four years, we multiply the points scored in a year by the number of years: 840 points/year * 4 years = 3360 points.

Therefore, Ara has scored a total of 3360 points in the four years.

"When a power outage occurs, it's essential to have a reliable source of light. In this scenario, Brianna's family has taken the necessary precautions by gathering flashlights and candles. 

To determine the total number of light sources, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and candles separately and then add them together.

There are 4 people in the household, and each person has a flashlight. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Now, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"

"When it comes to applying a coat of varnish to paintings, the drying time is a crucial factor to consider. The drying time can significantly impact the overall quality and longevity of the artwork. 

In this scenario, we have two different types of varnish with varying drying times. The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, while the new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting.

To determine the total drying time for 6 paintings with each type of varnish, we need to multiply the drying time for one painting by the number of paintings. 

For the old varnish, the total drying time for 6 paintings would be 7 minutes * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, the total drying time for 6 paintings would be 12 minutes * 6 = 72 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the difference in drying time between the old and new varnish: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish compared to the old varnish.

"To determine the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%. This means 30% of $9000 is subtracted from the initial value. To find 30% of $9000, we multiply $9000 by 0.3, which equals $2700. Subtracting $2700 from the initial value gives us $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30%. This means 30% of $6300 is subtracted from the value after the first year. To find 30% of $6300, we multiply $6300 by 0.3, which equals $1890. Subtracting $1890 from the value after the first year gives us $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%. This means 20% of $4410 is subtracted from the value after the second year. To find 20% of $4410, we multiply $4410 by 0.2, which equals $882. Subtracting $882 from the value after the second year gives us $3528.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies. She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, which gives her 20 * $2 = $40. Additionally, she sells 40 cookies at $1 each, resulting in 40 * $1 = $40. Therefore, her total earnings from cupcakes and cookies are $40 + $40 = $80.

Next, we need to calculate her expenses. She buys 5 trays at $4 each, which amounts to 5 * $4 = $20.

Now, let's subtract her total expenses from her total earnings: $80 - $20 = $60.

Frances has $60 left."
"Let's analyze the situation. We have an ice cream truck traveling through a neighborhood, and children are joining in. 

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck. On the second street, each of these children is joined by another child, resulting in a total of 5 + 5 = 10 children.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children. To find the total number of children now, we multiply 10 by 2 and add the result to 10: 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

However, the original 5 children then leave the group. To find the final number of children following the truck, we subtract 5 from 30: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, the correct answer is 25."
"To determine the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to calculate the total number of meals she has already given out and subtract that from the total number of meals she has.

Mamou distributed 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. 

First, let's add up the total number of meals given out: 
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

Now, we subtract the total number of meals given out from the total number of meals Mamou has: 
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute to the affected families.

The final answer is: 1218"

To find the total amount of money James has, we need to add the values of all the coins together. 

25 (quarter) + 10 (nickels) + 70 (dimes) = 105 cents

The final answer is: 105"
"To determine the total age of the siblings, we need to calculate the age of each sibling and then sum them up.

Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the older brother's age by doubling the age of the younger brother. Therefore, the older brother is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

The three sisters are all the same age, which is 16 years old. To find the total age of the sisters, we multiply their age by the number of sisters: 16 * 3 = 48 years.

Now, we need to find the total age of the brothers. We already know the age of the younger brother is 12 years, and the older brother is 24 years. So, the total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36 years.

To find the total age of all the siblings, we add the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters: 36 + 48 = 84 years.

The total age of all the siblings is 84 years."
"To determine the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

Meditation time per day is 30 minutes, as Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before sleep. Since she meditates 7 days a week, the total meditation time per week is 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

Yoga time per day is 60 minutes, as she practices for 1 hour. Since she practices yoga 5 days a week, the total yoga time per week is 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week is 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week.

In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga is 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"To calculate the total square feet of fabric used for the quilt, we need to consider the area of each type of t-shirt. 

Small t-shirts are 3 square feet each, medium t-shirts are 4 square feet each, and large t-shirts are 6 square feet each. 

If Octavia uses 11 small shirts, the total area from these shirts would be 11 * 3 = 33 square feet. 

For the medium shirts, using 8 shirts would result in a total area of 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.

Lastly, using 6 large shirts would give a total area of 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

To find the total area of the quilt, we add the areas from each type of shirt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

"To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower. 

First, let's find the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

Next, we need to find the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. Then, we add this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

Now, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower to find the total number of seeds: 36 + 54 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of pens Sarah has, we need to understand the relationship between the number of pens each person owns. 

First, we know that George has 18 pens. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can calculate Timothy's total by multiplying George's pens by 3. This gives us 18 * 3 = 54 pens for Timothy.

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can calculate this by dividing Timothy's total by 2. This gives us 54 / 2 = 27 pens for Sarah.

Therefore, the correct answer is 27."
"To determine Jackie's height before summer, we need to understand the relationships between her height, Anne's height, and Albert's height.

Albert's height is given as 36 inches. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, we can calculate Anne's height by multiplying Albert's height by 2. This gives us 2 * 36 = 72 inches for Anne's height.

Now, we know that Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne. To find Jackie's height, we subtract 2 inches from Anne's height: 72 - 2 = 70 inches.

Since Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, we can find her height before summer by subtracting 3 inches from her current height: 70 - 3 = 67 inches.

Therefore, Jackie's height before summer was 67 inches.

The final answer is: 67"
"To determine the total revenue from selling chocolate bars, we need to consider the production rate and the selling price per bar.

The company produces 5000 chocolate bars per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly production is 5000 * 7 = 35000 bars.

For two weeks, the total production would be 35000 * 2 = 70000 bars.

Given that each bar is sold for $2, the total revenue can be calculated as 70000 * 2 = $140000.

The final answer is: $140000"
"When it comes to making smart financial decisions, it's essential to consider all the factors involved. In this case, Jake is shopping at a clothing store with a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts and a discount on shoes.

Let's break down the costs. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, we need to consider the deal. He pays the full price for one T-shirt and 50% off for the other. The cost of the first T-shirt is $8, and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Now, let's move on to the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings from completing his chores and then subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for completing his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought 4 cones at $1.25 each, so the total cost is 4 * 1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total earnings: $18 - $5 = $13.

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket, which is $6.50.

"To determine the current number of cookies Randy has, we need to consider the changes in his cookie collection. Initially, Randy had a diverse selection of cookies, including oatmeal, chocolate chip, and sugar cookies.

Let's break down the changes in his cookie collection:

- Randy started with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies, totaling 18 cookies.
- He consumed 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor, which means he ate 3 cookies in total.
- For lunch, he had 2 oatmeal cookies, reducing his oatmeal cookie count by 2.
- He then gave away 2 sugar cookies to his friends, decreasing his sugar cookie count by 2.
- To satisfy his dinner cravings, Randy baked 4 of each flavor, adding 12 new cookies to his collection.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:

Initially, Randy had 18 cookies. 
He ate or gave away 7 cookies (3 for snack + 2 for lunch + 2 given away).
He baked 12 new cookies.

"To determine the time it takes for Nate to fill in all the holes, we need to consider the net number of holes he fills per day. Since he fills 9 holes per day and the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

The total number of holes dug by the dog is the number of holes dug per day multiplied by the number of days Nate was on vacation. 

Holes dug per day = 6
Days Nate was on vacation = 14
Total holes dug = 6 * 14 = 84

However, since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to add these to the total holes dug during the day. 

Holes dug at night = 6 * 14 = 84
Total holes = 84 + 84 = 168

Now, we can calculate the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes.

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 / 3
Days to fill holes = 56

To find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7.

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 8

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested. However, this statement is incorrect as it initially stated he gathered half as many test tubes. Let's re-evaluate: If Igor gathered 8 test tubes, then he gathered 2 fewer test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested. So, the number of Petri dishes is 8 + 2 = 10.
- Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 10 Petri dishes = 25 items.

Since Igor had 29 items on the lab bench, he must have lost 29 - 25 = 4 beakers."
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table requires 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is assembling 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

To find out how many screws James will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The total amount of money raised by the girls is $2180."
"To determine how long it took Vanessa to complete her part of the relay race, we need to understand the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's running speeds and distances.

Given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if we let Vanessa's time to run 1 mile be 't' minutes, then Aaron's time to run 1 mile would be 't/2' minutes. 

Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, and Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron must have run half the distance, which is 2 miles.

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron ran 2 miles, we can set up the equation:

t/2 * 2 = 16

Solving for 't', we get:
t = 16 * 2 / 2
t = 16

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we must first calculate the required line for the dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

The dock is 200 feet long, so the required line is: 
200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he has from the total required: 
600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5) + $5 (bottle of wine) = (2 * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we can now calculate their weekly revenue.

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * Number of days open = $15 * 2 = $30

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to consider the profit percentage and the total cost of the watermelons.

The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80 and sold them at a 25% profit. This means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit).

Let's calculate the cost price of 1 watermelon:
Total cost of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

Now, let's find the selling price of 1 watermelon:
Selling price of 50 watermelons = 125% of $80
Selling price of 50 watermelons = (125/100) * $80 = $100
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the current age of James, we need to determine Dora's current age first. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Now, let's find the age of John's youngest son. We know that John was 32 when his youngest son was born. This means his youngest son is currently 32 years old.

To find his age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 32 + 3 = 35 years.

Therefore, John's youngest son will be 35 years old in 3 years.

"When it comes to unexpected car repairs, it's essential to consider the total cost, including the price of the replacement part and labor. In this scenario, Mark needs a new radiator, which can be quite costly.

The original price of the radiator is $400. However, Mark is fortunate to find it at a junk shop with an 80% discount. To calculate the discounted price, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 400 * 0.2 (since 100% - 80% = 20% remaining) = $80.

Now, let's consider the labor costs. Mark hires a mechanic to install the new radiator, which takes 3 hours at $50 per hour. The total labor cost is 3 * 50 = $150.

To find the total cost, we add the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost: 80 + 150 = $230.

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230 for the new radiator and installation.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of animals and the total number of legs. Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can express this as C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. So, the total number of legs can be expressed as 2C + 4W = 70.

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the second equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

Therefore, the number of chickens on the farm is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"When it comes to sharing food, especially in a social setting, it's essential to consider the nutritional value and portion control. In this scenario, we have 7 pizzas cut into 8 slices each, making a total of 56 slices. 

To determine the ideal portion size for each individual, we need to consider the number of people involved. Since there are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends), we can divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find the fair share.

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

This way, each person can enjoy a reasonable portion of the pizza, ensuring everyone gets a fair share without overindulging."
