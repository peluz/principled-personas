"Let's break down Janet's daily egg sales. She lays 16 eggs per day. For breakfast, she eats 3 eggs, and she bakes 4 eggs for her friends. 

The total number of eggs used is 3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs Janet has left: 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.

Janet sells these remaining 9 eggs at $2 each. To find out her daily earnings, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber required. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half that much white fiber, we calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Josh initially buys a house for $80,000 and then invests $50,000 in repairs. This investment increases the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the new value of the house, we need to calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value. 150% of $80,000 is 1.5 times $80,000, which is $120,000. 

New value = Original value + (Original value * 150%)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"Hey there, let's break down James' running routine. He decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. Each sprint is 60 meters long. To find the total meters he runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

First, let's find the total meters he runs in one session. Since he runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Now, we know James runs 3 times a week. To find the total meters he runs in a week, we multiply the total meters he runs in one session by the number of sessions he has in a week:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon.

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"I'd be happy to help Kylar figure out how much he needs to pay for the glasses. 

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8, which is 0.6 * $1.8 = $1.08. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time. 

Let's find the pattern: 
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $3.
- The third glass costs $3 * 0.6 = $1.8.
- The fourth glass costs $1.8 * 0.6 = $1.08.
- The fifth glass costs $1.08 * 0.6 = $0.648.
- The sixth glass costs $0.648 * 0.6 = $0.3888.
- The seventh glass costs $0.3888 * 0.6 = $0.23328.
- The eighth glass costs $0.23328 * 0.6 = $0.139968.
- The ninth glass costs $0.139968 * 0.6 = $0.0839856.
- The tenth glass costs $0.0839856 * 0.6 = $0.05039136.
- The eleventh glass costs $0.05039136 * 0.6 = $0.030234816.
- The twelfth glass costs $0.030234816 * 0.6 = $0.0181407896.
- The thirteenth glass costs $0.0181407896 * 0.6 = $0.01088447476.
- The fourteenth glass costs $0.01088447476 * 0.6 = $0.006530684856.
- The fifteenth glass costs $0.006530684856 * 0.6 = $0.0039184109136.
- The sixteenth glass costs $0.0039184109136 * 0.6 = $0.0023610469456.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.648 + $0.3888 + $0.23328 + $0.139968 + $0.0839856 + $0.05039136 + $0.030234816 + $0.0181407896 + $0.01088447476 + $0.006530684856 + $0.0039184109136 + $0.0023610469456 = $23.016

The total cost is $23.016."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute. To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Next, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 100 minutes

However, we need to consider that Carla has to restart the download from the beginning after the updates are installed. This means she has to download the entire 200 GB again. The time it takes to download the entire file is:
Time to download 200 GB = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

Since Carla has to download the entire file after the updates are installed, the total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the entire file:
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down John's trip into segments to find the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Then, he turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this time.

Next, he drives at a speed of 30 mph for half an hour. The distance he covers in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

After that, he drives at a speed of 80 mph for the remaining 2 hours. The distance he covers in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance he traveled in the return trip:
Total distance in return trip = 15 + 160
Total distance in return trip = 175 miles

However, we need to consider the time he spent in standstill traffic. Since he was not moving during this time, we need to subtract the time from the total time to find the actual time he spent driving. The total time for the return trip is 4 hours, and he spent 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he spent 2 hours driving.

The distance he traveled in the return trip is 175 miles, and he drove for 2 hours at 80 mph. To find the distance he would have traveled in 2 hours at 80 mph, we can use the formula:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

However, this is the distance he would have traveled if he drove for 2 hours at 80 mph. Since he actually drove for 2 hours at 80 mph and then drove for half an hour at 30 mph, we need to add the distance he traveled in the half hour to find the total distance he traveled in the return trip:
Total distance in return trip = 160 + 15
Total distance in return trip = 175 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance John traveled:
Total distance = Distance traveled in the first 3 hours + Total distance in return trip
Total distance = 180 + 175
Total distance = 355 miles

Since John is now back home, the distance he is from home is 0 miles."
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 * $10 = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month, so we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"Let's break down the cost of the pastries Toula bought. She purchased 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, which is 3 * $68 = $204. Then, she bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen, which is 2 * $80 = $160. Lastly, she bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen, which is 6 * $55 = $330.

To find the total cost, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the initial cost of the lemon tree is $90. Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, generating a revenue of $10.5 per year. However, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year, resulting in a net revenue of $7.5 per year.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to calculate the time it takes for the tree to pay for itself. We can do this by dividing the initial cost by the net revenue:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.5 (net revenue) = 12 years

However, this calculation tells us when the tree will pay for itself, not when it starts earning money. Since the tree will start generating revenue in the first year, we can conclude that it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with ""x"". So, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

After selling at the green house, she had (x - x/3) = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners left.

She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

After selling at the red house, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2x/3 - 2) is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = (x/3 - 1).

So, she had (2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1)) = (x/3 - 1) vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a dance class of 20 students. First, 20% of them enrolled in contemporary dance. To find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance, we multiply 20 by 0.2:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

Now, we need to find the number of students who are left. We subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students:
20 - 4 = 16 students

Next, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. To find the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance, we multiply 16 by 0.25:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

Now, we know that 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance and 4 students enrolled in jazz dance. To find the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:
20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the best purchase option for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each item.

The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, so the increase in value for the $5,000 jewelry is 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * $5,000 = $125.

The electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%, so the increase in value for the $8,000 electronic gadgets is 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Since the jewelry has a higher potential increase in value, the merchant should choose the jewelry.

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125.

The final answer is: $125"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two trains that leave San Rafael at the same time and travel in the same direction for the first day, covering 80 miles. The next day, they change direction and travel 150 miles northward.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem helps us find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, which in this case is the total distance covered by each train.

The Pythagorean theorem is given by: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the lengths of the two sides, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.

In this case, a = 80 miles (westward distance) and b = 150 miles (northward distance). We can plug these values into the theorem to find the total distance covered by each train.

a^2 + b^2 = c^2
80^2 + 150^2 = c^2
6400 + 22500 = c^2
28900 = c^2
c = √28900
c = 170 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles."
"Let's break down Jill's annual salary. 

First, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching. She gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked per year: 35 * 50 = 1750 hours. Now, we multiply the total hours worked by her hourly wage: 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Next, we calculate her earnings from coaching. She gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Again, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked per year: 15 * 50 = 750 hours. Now, we multiply the total hours worked by her hourly wage: 750 * $30 = $22,500.

To find her total annual salary, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks and multiply it by the number of eggs she eats per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Claire eats 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down Marissa's hike. She's already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and another 2 miles in 1 hour, so she's covered 6 miles in 2 hours. To find the total time she needs to complete the 12-mile hike at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can divide the total distance by her desired average speed:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since she's already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 10 liters of orange drink that is two-thirds water. To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Next, we have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling. The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

However, we spill 1 liter of the orange drink. To find the remaining amount of water, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water. The remaining amount of water is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Since we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange and pineapple drinks. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Samantha is 31 years old, and Raymond was born 6 years before her. This means Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

We also know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to find the difference between Raymond's current age (25) and the age when he had a son (23).

25 - 23 = 2

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the sales for Billy on Tuesday. He had 8 customers in total. The first 3 customers bought one DVD each, so they purchased a total of 3 DVDs. The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, which is a total of 4 DVDs. The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers. 

3 + 4 = 7

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To find out how much shorter a candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns for 4 hours, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased other than the pizza boxes. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15, and the cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

Adding these costs together, we get $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Now, we subtract this total from the amount Marie paid, which is $50. This gives us $50 - $33 = $17. 

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Mishka's shopping spree. She bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. 

One pair of shorts costs $16.50, so 3 pairs will be 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.
One pair of pants costs $22.50, so 3 pairs will be 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.
One pair of shoes costs $42, so 3 pairs will be 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide 60 by 15:
60 / 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Gloria has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much.

Since the more expensive pair of heels costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, we can express the cost of the more expensive pair as 2 * 33 = $66.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the situation: B = 33 + 66 - 5, where B is the cost of the boots.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

So, the cost of the boots is $94."
"Let's break down the problem. We're given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

"Let's break down the guesses. The first person thinks there are 80 jelly beans in the jar. The second person thinks there are 20 more than half of the first one, which is 40 + 20 = 60. The third person thinks there are 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100.

To find the average, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of people. The total is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. There are 3 people.

The average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to calculate the total time he spends on them each day and then multiply that by 7.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog requires 0.5 hours of his time per day. 

First, let's find the total time John spends on his dogs daily. 

Number of dogs: 10
Time per dog: 0.5 hours

Total time per day = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Total time per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Now, we need to find the total time John spends on his dogs in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total time per day by 7.

Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7
Total time per week = 35 hours

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's break down the problem. We know Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G.

We can set up two equations based on the given information. The first equation is G = S + 30, which represents the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins. The second equation is S + G = 110, which represents the total number of coins.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110. Combining like terms, we get 2S + 30 = 110. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the information given to us about the jewels.

We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. Now, we need to figure out how many jewels Aaron has. It's mentioned that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 

First, we find half of Raymond's jewels: 40 / 2 = 20. 
Then, we add 5 to that number to find out how many jewels Aaron has: 20 + 5 = 25.

Now that we know Aaron has 25 jewels, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. It's mentioned that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. 

To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total: 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down Mike's ping pong game. He plays for 40 minutes, which is divided into two 20-minute segments. 

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. 

Now, let's calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. He scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which equals 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in that time frame. 

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. 

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Since each set costs $5.00, Terry spends 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = 195 dollars.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is 8 * 20 = 160 dollars.

John also has $5 left, which means he spent 195 - 5 = 190 dollars on the video games.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $35, which is the amount he used from his own money. 
35 / 15 = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 11 sets with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time.
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to determine her walking and running speeds. We know that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, and it's half as fast as her running speed. So, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4. This gives us 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends walking and running. We know she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time she spends walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours, and the time she spends running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"Let's break down the problem. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon. Each pie was cut into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you can still consume. Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you've already consumed 1800 calories. 

Subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Now, we know a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams you can eat, multiply the number of servings you can still have by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles, and for every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles. The cost of one pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. If he sells each candle for $2.00, we need to find his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Since Charlie sells each candle for $2.00 and he makes and sells 20 candles, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to find the total cost. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is:

Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $10.00 per pound * 2
Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax = $20.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"Let's break down Meredith's writing schedule. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the total number of articles she wrote and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours). The total number of articles written in 3 days is 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She then purchased a package of Post-it notes and used 220 of them at work. After that, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to determine the total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package. We can do this by adding the initial Post-it notes and the ones she purchased, then subtracting the ones she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x. The total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package is 80 (initial) + x (package) - 220 (used) + 23 (remaining).

Since the total Post-it notes after purchasing the package is equal to the sum of the initial Post-it notes, the Post-it notes used, and the Post-it notes remaining, we can set up the equation:

x + 23 = 80 + 220 - 23

Simplifying the equation:
x + 23 = 277 - 23
x + 23 = 254
x = 254 - 23
x = 231

The final answer is: 231"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie: 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. We know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the red ties cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

To find the total cost of red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie: 10 * 60 = $600.

Finally, we add the cost of blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week:
Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. To find the total number of eggs per week, we multiply this by 7 days:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens are produced per week:
1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"Let's break down Tom's journey. He travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is a 3-hour period. Since his ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, the distance covered during this time is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

Now, let's calculate the time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour. It's simply 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

For the return trip, the distance remains the same, 30 miles. However, his ship's speed is now 6 miles per hour. To find the time it took to travel back, we divide the distance by the speed: 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, the total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, and he removes 30 of them. To find the total weight of the comic books, we multiply the weight of one comic book by the number of comic books: 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can calculate the number of toys by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy. The remaining weight is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. So, we divide 7.5 by 0.5 to get the number of toys: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the revenue earned from repairing truck tires and car tires on Thursday. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire.

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Next, we need to calculate the revenue earned from repairing car tires on Friday. Since no truck tires were repaired, we only need to consider the car tires.

Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue: $520
Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

Now, we add the number of instructions in both recipes: 20 + 40 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tommy is selling brownies for $3 each and cheesecakes for $4 each. He sells 43 brownies and 23 slices of cheesecake.

First, we calculate the total amount from the brownies: 43 * $3 = $129.
Next, we calculate the total amount from the cheesecakes: 23 * $4 = $92.

Now, we add the two amounts together: $129 + $92 = $221.

The final answer is: $221"
"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to calculate the interest charged on the cell phones and add it to the original price.

The original price of 5 cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750.

The interest charged for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest charged for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total cost of the cell phones is $750 + $15 = $765.

Since Shiela is paying in installments for 3 months, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find the monthly payment.

The monthly payment is $765 / 3 = $255.

The final answer is: $255"
"To find out how much Artie will make, we need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar. The prices are as follows: marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot, and begonias for $2.12 per pot.

Rounding these prices, we get: marigolds for $3 per pot, petunias for $2 per pot, and begonias for $2 per pot.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Artie will make from each type of flower:

Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the amounts together to find the total:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"I'm Victor, and I'm happy to help you with your question. 

So, Luke is building a 4-level sandcastle, and each level has half the square footage of the one below it. The top level has a square footage of 16. 

Let's break it down: 
- The second level will have half the square footage of the top level, which is 16 / 2 = 8.
- The third level will have half the square footage of the second level, which is 8 / 2 = 4.
- The fourth level will have half the square footage of the third level, which is 4 / 2 = 2.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in that time.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, let's find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost per flower for each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the grooming is $100. To find 30% of this amount, we multiply it by 0.3.

30% of $100 = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the cost after the discount.

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

The final answer is: $70"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much water the girls got. Since they each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, we can calculate this by multiplying 24 by 1/6.

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Next, we know that a boy got 6 liters of water. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy. 
Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

Now, let's subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water. 
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times what Grace weighs and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. 

4 times what Grace weighs is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

To find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 3 rose bushes, and each of them has 25 roses. To find the total number of roses, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75.

Now, we know that each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600.

So, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's break down the problem. We know the football team played a total of 22 games. We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost. 

Let's denote the number of games they lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We can set up two equations based on this information: W = L + 8 and W + L = 22.

We can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7

Now that we know L, we can find W: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

So, the team won 15 games.

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

He goes on 4 vacations per year, so the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The alarm rings three times a day, but the number of times it rings each time varies.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 10% increase for 5 years, and then calculate the salary for the next 3 years.

The initial salary is $600. An increase of 10% of $600 is $60. So, the salary after 5 years is $600 + ($60 * 5) = $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

The increase for the next year is 10% of $900, which is $90. So, the salary after 6 years is $900 + $90 = $990. The increase for the next year is 10% of $990, which is $99. So, the salary after 7 years is $990 + $99 = $1089. The increase for the next year is 10% of $1089, which is $109.1. So, the salary after 8 years is $1089 + $109.1 = $1198.1. The increase for the next year is 10% of $1198.1, which is $119.81. So, the salary after 9 years is $1198.1 + $119.81 = $1317.91.

The final answer is: $1317.91"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we denote the number of copies Harald sold as H, then the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

16 (total guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed for the picnic, we need to calculate the amount eaten by adults and children separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how much the adults will eat. Since there are 20 adults and each adult will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, the total amount eaten by adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much the children will eat. Since children eat half as much as adults, and there are 5 children, the total amount eaten by children is 5 * (10 / 2) = 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the amount eaten by adults and children to find the total amount of potato salad needed: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Cindy has 4 pets.
- Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
- Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

"To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of 40 and subtract it from 40. 
10% of 40 is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.

Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total cars originally on the motorway = 30
- 5 cars took an exit, so the remaining cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5 = 25
- Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = cars in the first 15 minutes + cars in the remaining 15 minutes
- Cars in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we need to calculate 1/4 of 20, which is 5. Then, we add this to the first friend's total: 20 + 5 = 25.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. We know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

"To find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to know the rate at which it covers the city and the total distance of the city.

The fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. We can use this information to find out how many 3-mile sections are in the city. The city is 42 miles across, so we divide 42 by 3 to find the number of sections.

42 / 3 = 14

This means there are 14 sections of 3 miles each in the city. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we can multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 * 10 = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The box dimensions are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. 

The inner length of the box is 5 - 2 = 3 inches (subtracting 1 inch from each side).

The inner width of the box is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The inner height of the box is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"Let's break down Frankie's TV-watching schedule. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes. That's 2 hours in total.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes x. Since each episode is 0.5 hours long, the total time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Wednesday is 0.5x hours.

On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours of 1-hour and 30-minute episodes. This includes 1 hour of a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours of a 30-minute episode. 

On Friday, he watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes.

The total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours. The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. 

Time spent watching 30-minute episodes is 7 - 5 = 2 hours. Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes is 2 / 0.5 = 4.

However, this is not the only possible solution. We need to consider the time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Thursday. If we let y be the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Thursday, then the total time spent watching 30-minute episodes is 0.5x + 0.5y. We already know this is equal to 2 hours.

We also know that on Thursday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours. This is the same as 1 + y. 

Now we have two equations:

0.5x + 0.5y = 2
1 + y = 1.5

We can solve the second equation for y: y = 0.5.

Now we can substitute y into the first equation: 0.5x + 0.5(0.5) = 2. This simplifies to 0.5x + 0.25 = 2. Subtracting 0.25 from both sides gives 0.5x = 1.75. Dividing both sides by 0.5 gives x = 3.5.

However, this is not possible since x must be an integer (you can't watch a fraction of an episode). Therefore, our initial assumption that y = 0.5 is incorrect. Let's try y = 1. 

Now we have two equations:

0.5x + 0.5y = 2
1 + y = 1.5

We can solve the second equation for y: y = 0.5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's calculate the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the cashback reward per gallon is $0.20. 

To find the total cost of gas without rewards, we multiply the cost per gallon by the number of gallons:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

Next, we calculate the total cashback rewards by multiplying the cashback reward per gallon by the number of gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"Let's break down the problem. We have two roll-ups with different dimensions. Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, while Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.

To find the total number of roll-ups eaten by each, we need to multiply the width by the length of each roll-up.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

Now, let's find the average number of roll-ups eaten by adding the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and dividing by 2.

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of rowing in feet per second: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

Now, let's divide the total time by the rate to find the total distance rowed: 64 seconds / 1.25 feet/second = 51.2 feet.

Since we are only interested in sets of 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10: 51.2 feet / 10 = 5.12 sets.

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2: 5.12 sets * 2 liters/set = 10.24 liters.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sasha has leftover lumber that she bought at a certain price, and now she wants to sell it after the prices have gone up by 50%. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each, so the total cost of these boards is 10 * $10 = $100. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each, so the total cost of these boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards, so the total revenue from these boards is 10 * $15 = $150. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards, so the total revenue from these boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the fraction of the total mixture that is sugar. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there were initially 2 containers with 5 vehicles each at the port. This means the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles imported on the second day by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's salary. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago was 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. To find his new salary, we need to calculate 40% of his old salary and add it to his old salary. 40% of $40000 is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. So, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of her old salary. 40% of $28000 is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. So, Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

"Let's break down Rosie's running distance into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour:
Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jennie is helping at her mom's office. She has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and a pile of letters already stamped. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, how many were in that pile when Jennie began?

To find the initial number of letters in the already-stamped pile, we need to determine how many letters Jennie added to it. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she must have added 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters to the already-stamped pile.

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the already-stamped pile after Jennie added 20 letters. To find the initial number of letters, we subtract the number of letters Jennie added from the current total: 30 - 20 = 10.

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Julia bought a package of spoons, and her husband gave her another package of 5 new spoons. She used 3 spoons while making the stew. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

From the information given, we know that after her husband gave her 5 more spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. We also know that she used 3 spoons, so we need to account for those as well.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Dillon will spend at the store.

First, we need to determine the cost of each item. We know that each pepper costs $15. 

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item. Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180.

Dillon buys 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers is 20 * $15 = $300.

Dillon buys 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add the cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges together: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To find the hospital's profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total revenue from patients.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. We multiply the number of patients by the average time per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.

12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The total cost for the doctors is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.

200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Now, let's find the total revenue from patients. We multiply the number of patients by the hourly rate charged to the patients and then by the number of hours per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour = 2000 * $200/hour = $400000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

First, a third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. To find out how many elves quit, we need to divide 60 by 3. 60 / 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit.

Now, we need to find out how many elves are left. We subtract the elves who quit from the total number of elves: 60 - 20 = 40.

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. To find out how many elves are left, we subtract 10 from the remaining elves: 40 - 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June.

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = Expenditure in May - $60
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60 = $440

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

The final answer is: $940"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down Walt's walking miles. On Monday, he walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total. 

41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to calculate the total cost of car washes per month and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15. 
So, the total cost per month is 4 * $15 = $60.

Now, multiply the total cost per month by 12 to get the total cost per year:
$60 * 12 = $720.

The final answer is: $720"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Brian initially has 20 video games, but he lost 5 right before the comparison was made. So, we need to find out how many video games he has left.

Brian has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Now, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. It's mentioned that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply Brian's remaining video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times Brian's remaining video games is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this by dividing 27 by 3.

27 / 3 = 9

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

2. Next, we need to find the number of female Scottish unicorns. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this by multiplying 9 by 2/3.

9 * 2/3 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down Rory's delivery order. She orders 2 subs for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each, and 2 cookies for $1.00 each. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
- Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total cost with the delivery fee:
- Total cost with delivery fee and tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark took a test with 75 questions and another test with 100 questions. He completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete it. Since he completes 5 questions per hour, he would have completed 8 * 5 = 40 questions in that time. However, he only completed 40 questions out of 75, so he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete it. At a rate of 5 questions per hour, he would have completed 6 * 5 = 30 questions in that time. However, he only completed 30 questions out of 100, so he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests: 35 + 70 = 105.

The final answer is: 105"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to first find four times the number of blue gumballs. 

Four times the number of blue gumballs is 4 * 12 = 48.

There are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs, so the number of pink gumballs is 48 + 22 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's break down the information given. We have a total of 700 bees in the hive. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many babies as queens.

Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We know that W = 2B, since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. We also know that B = 2Q, since there are twice as many babies as queens.

The total number of bees is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens, which is W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Since B = 2Q, we have B = 2(100) = 200.

Since W = 2B, we have W = 2(200) = 400.

So, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

The final answer is: 400"
"Let's calculate how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

First, we need to find out how many hours he would work in a week. Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours more each day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"Let's break down the costs of John's purchases. 

First, we have the food items: milk for 2 dollars and eggs for 3 dollars. The total cost of food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

Next, we have the non-food items: light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. The total cost of non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Since there's a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount. To do this, we multiply the cost of non-food items by 0.1 (which is the decimal form of 10%): 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax to get the total cost: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

There are 100 pineapples per hectare. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Johnny has three Lego sets on the floor. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. 

The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each set together: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees. However, 15 of these bees returned, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 45 - 15 = 30 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.
5. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees. However, 30 of these bees had not returned yet, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 30 (from step 3) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 30 bees return.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the cost of admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom bought 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

"Let's break down the information given:

- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up an equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has ""x"". Then, Charlie has 3x friends.

We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two racers, Steve and Tim, who are competing to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives 3 miles away from the school and can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school and can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can calculate the distances as follows:

Steve's distance = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 15840 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 36 minutes

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 36
Difference in time = 4 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Shawnda's bike inflation service charges 25 cents per tire. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated. 5 people came by on bicycles, and each bicycle has 2 tires, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 bicycle tires. 3 people came by on tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tricycle tires. And 1 person came by on a unicycle, which has 1 tire. 

So, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires. 

Now, let's calculate the total cost of inflating these tires. Since each tire costs 25 cents, the total cost is 20 * 25 cents = $5.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially. 
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 14 (by Dave) + 7 (by seagull) = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. 
   After the pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries were left. The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   We can simplify this to (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   We can solve for x by first adding 1 to both sides: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Then, multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18.
   Finally, add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Blake and Kelly are running on a 100-yard football field. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means he covers a distance of 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Now, let's calculate Kelly's distance. She runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner. To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 5 red cars, each costing $4, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

We also have 3 action figures, and each one costs $5. So, the total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which means it costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the toys: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"Let's break down the situation. If Jackie decides to do her taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, which means she'll lose $35/hour in missed income. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant:
Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

Since the income lost is greater than the cost of hiring the accountant, Jackie will actually be better off hiring the accountant. To find out how much more money she'll have, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:
Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories and subtract that from her budget.

The total cost of the computer accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323

Now, subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:
€1500 - €1323 = €177

Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing."
"To figure out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to determine how many eggs she needs in total for the Spanish flans. Since she needs 3 eggs per Spanish flan and she's making 15, she needs 3 * 15 = 45 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job: 45 / 9 = 5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we denote Brooke's current age as B, then Seth's current age is 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and 2B + 2. The sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write an equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Ethel has $8. To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we're told that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. So, we add 2 to 16: 16 + 2 = 18.

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday (5 days), and 10 miles a day on Saturday and Sunday (2 days). 

So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is 20 * 5 = 100 miles. 
The total miles he walks on Saturday and Sunday is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three groups of invertebrates with different numbers of legs. 

First, we'll calculate the total number of legs for the spiders. There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. So, the total number of legs for the spiders is 80 * 8 = 640.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of legs for the insects. There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs. So, the total number of legs for the insects is 90 * 6 = 540.

Now, let's consider the rare mutant invertebrates. There are 3 of them, and each has 10 legs. So, the total number of legs for the mutant invertebrates is 3 * 10 = 30.

To find the total number of legs, we add the number of legs for each group together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210.

The final answer is: 1210"
"Let's break down the information given. We know Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the increased minimum payment for each debt:

- Student loans: $300 * 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since Jessica pays this amount each month, we multiply it by 12 to get the total annual payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

The final answer is: 95"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons.

First, we need to find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, the total revenue per gallon is:
20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

Since they made a profit of $25, their total revenue is the sum of the profit and the cost. Let's call the total cost 'x'. Then the total revenue is:
Total revenue = Profit + Cost
Total revenue = $25 + x

Since they sell each gallon for $10, the number of gallons they sold is:
Total revenue = Number of gallons * $10/gallon
$25 + x = Number of gallons * $10/gallon

Now, we can solve for the number of gallons:
Number of gallons = ($25 + x) / $10

The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The cost of sugar per gallon is $2, so the cost of lemons per gallon is:
Cost of lemons per gallon = $5 - $2 = $3

The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:
Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 * (($25 + x) / $10)

Since we are given that the total profit is $25, we can set up the equation:
Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$10 * Number of gallons - ($3 * Number of gallons) - ($2 * Number of gallons) = $25
$10 * (($25 + x) / $10) - $5 * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25

Simplifying the equation:
(10 - 5) * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
5 * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
(25 + x) / 2 = $25
25 + x = $50
x = $25

Now that we have the total cost, we can find the cost of lemons:
Total cost = $25
Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
Total cost of lemons = $25
Number of gallons = $25 / $3 = 8.33

The final answer is: $25"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know there are a total of 240 participants in the race. Out of these, 80 are Japanese. To find the number of Chinese participants, we subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants.

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we're told that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

"Let's break down Zaid's expenses step by step.

First, Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. His monthly salary is 6000 dollars, so the amount spent on rent is 1/4 * 6000 = 600 dollars.

Next, he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. The amount spent on car fuel is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000 dollars.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel: 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400 dollars.

Zaid then donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. The amount donated is 1/2 * 3400 = 1700 dollars.

After the donation, the remaining amount is 3400 - 1700 = 1700 dollars.

Next, Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars for their expenses. The total amount given is 200 + 700 = 900 dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the amount Zaid has left: 1700 - 900 = 800 dollars.

The final answer is: $800"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. 

Now, we need to find out how many crabs Rani has. It's stated that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs, we add the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations and 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the value of 'x'. 

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40. 
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can write an equation to represent the situation two years ago:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * Jan's age two years ago + 5
Since Jan is 30, two years ago Jan was 28. 
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * 28 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19

Now, we know Mark's age two years ago was 19. To find Mark's current age, we add 2 to this:
Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:
Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down the information given. We have two teams competing in a 4 by 400 meter relay. The well-rounded team has four members, each running their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. The less well-rounded team has a similar setup, but their first runner runs 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the total time for the well-rounded team and the less well-rounded team. The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

Now, let's calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team. Their first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a six-sided die, which means there are 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The favorable outcomes for this are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 total outcomes, making the probability 3/6 or 1/2, which is equivalent to 50%.

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the die is rolled again, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Since these events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. 

50% - 25% = 25%

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

"I'm Victor, and I'm here to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store.

First, let's calculate the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters. Since there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Next, we know that the rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw.

The total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Now, let's find the total number of rats. Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can set up the equation 3r = 15, where 'r' is the number of rats in each cage. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount owed is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2% or 0.02.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $100 + $2 = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $102 + $2.04 = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the tickets, food, and rides: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tom starts with 50 trees. Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. This means the net change in the number of trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. So, after 10 years, Tom has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

Now, we subtract the trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91.

"Let's break down the events step by step to find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Now, to find out how much change she will get, we need to subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has.

Total cost of crayons = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon

So, there are 6277 children in Soda."
"Let's break down Elaine's Pokémon card collection. Initially, she had 20 cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Since Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

The total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.

The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Baldur gets water from a well, and he gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. 

First, we need to find the total number of pails he gets in a day. To do this, we add the number of pails he gets in the morning to the number of pails he gets in the afternoon: 5 pails (morning) + 6 pails (afternoon) = 11 pails.

Now that we know he gets 11 pails of water in a day, we need to find out how much water is in each pail. According to the problem, each pail contains 5 liters of water.

To find the total amount of water he gets every day, we multiply the total number of pails by the amount of water in each pail: 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down John's situation. He wins an award with a $5000 monetary reward and a 5% raise in salary. His current weekly salary is $2000, and he works every week of the year.

First, we need to calculate the 5% raise:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = 100
New salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John works 52 weeks a year, we'll multiply his new salary by the number of weeks:
Total amount made that year = New salary * Number of weeks
= 2100 * 52
= 109200

However, we also need to add the $5000 award to this total:
Total amount made that year = 109200 + 5000
= 114200

So, John made a total of $114200 that year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Josie has a 10-acre farm, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. To find the total tons of grapes produced per year, we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes per acre:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Now, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. To find the total number of barrels of wine produced per year, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels per ton:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Let's break down Carl's cheese usage for the week. He ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used a total of 7 * 2 = 14 slices for his sandwiches.

For breakfast, Carl had cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. That's 3 slices per omelet. So, for the 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for his omelets.

In addition to his sandwiches and omelets, Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that used 8 slices of cheese.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. To find the total number of pens she had initially, we add these two numbers together: 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of blue and red pens she bought. Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the number of blue and red pens she bought: 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

Finally, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Since Brinley needs a total score of 558 for the semester, we need to find the score she needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

The final answer is: 291"
"Let's break down Michael's bike riding into two periods. 

In the first period, he rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. To find the total kilometers for this period, we multiply the kilometers per ride by the number of rides per week and then by the number of weeks: 25 kilometers * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

In the second period, he rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks. To find the total kilometers for this period, we multiply the kilometers per ride by the number of rides per week and then by the number of weeks: 60 kilometers * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Now, let's add the total kilometers for both periods: 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: 860"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Joe's bag of Halloween candy contains 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and it's given that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

First, we need to find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Now, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: 2600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Rose went to the store on Monday and bought 4 cakes. Then, she went to a different store on Tuesday and bought three times that number of cakes, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes. On Wednesday, she went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Now, we need to find the number of cups in twenty dozen. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"Let's break down Sara's situation. She wants to buy a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each, which totals $70. She already has $10 saved.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids and $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we need to calculate how much more money she needs to earn.

The amount she needs to earn is $70 - $10 = $60. She earns $5 from babysitting, which is $20 in total after babysitting 4 times. This leaves her with $60 - $20 = $40 to earn from mowing the lawn.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

So, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jerry has a certain number of red chickens and white chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day, Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We also know that W = R + 2.

The total number of eggs collected can be represented by the equation: 3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get: 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get: 3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms: 8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides: 8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8: R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find the total time Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Day 1: 100 customers
- Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total by Day 3: 500 customers

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's dive into the problem. We have two pools, both leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is 2x gallons.

The total amount of water leaked from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, let's consider the current situation. The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 gallons (since 4 gallons leaked out). The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 4 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. 

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Lori's hourly wage is $8.00. 

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she needs to pay a total of $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (10% of $2000) = $2200.

Now, let's calculate how much she will pay in 12 months. She is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months, so the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we need to subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay. So, the remaining balance is $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"Let's count the flowers in the vase. There are 4 roses in the vase. We're also told that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. To find the number of dahlias, we add 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then add 3 to each age.

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: 
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Naomi scored 68 points. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. To find out how many points Yuri scored, we need to calculate half of Naomi's points, which is 68 / 2 = 34. Then, we add 10 to that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so we add 17 to Naomi's points, which is 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"Let's break down James' Pokémon card collection. He initially has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

First, we need to find the total number of cards he has. 
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90

Next, James loses 8 water type cards. 
- Water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32
- Total cards = 90 - 8 = 82

Then, he buys 14 grass type cards. 
- Grass type cards = 20 + 14 = 34
- Total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

Now, we can calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, so we calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons.

Now, we need to find out how many watermelons were left after two months. We subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total number of watermelons.

120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Next, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so we calculate 3/4 of 84.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to determine how many tomatoes Steve eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total tomatoes he eats per week: 
6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. 
So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day. 
His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find the number of vines needed: 
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

Now, we need to find out how much this sum of money will be after it triples in a year. To do this, we multiply the current total by 3.

$30 * 3 = $90

So, after a year, Johnny will have $90."
"Let's break down the information given. We know Jessa is 20 years old. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25. 

Now, we know Mary is two years younger than Joan. To find Mary's age, we subtract 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23.

To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we add their individual ages together: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall.

30% of the students went out through exit A:
30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.
Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.
Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280

The rest of the students went out through exit C:
280 students went out through exit C.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. John has 54 candies.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.
3. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54 - 33 = 21.

"Let's break down the problem. Dolly has two books, and Pandora has one. Since they both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to calculate the total number of books read.

Dolly reads her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, which gives her a total of 3 books read.

Pandora reads her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, which gives her a total of 3 books read.

To find the total number of books read, we add the number of books read by Dolly and Pandora: 3 (by Dolly) + 3 (by Pandora) = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. This means he's left with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Each of his remaining pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and since there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down Jason's phone plan situation. He has a monthly plan of 1000 minutes. Every day, he has a 15-minute call with his boss, and he's also had 300 extra minutes of calls this month.

First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason used for his daily calls. Since there are 30 days in the month, we multiply the daily calls by 30: 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.

Next, we add the extra minutes he used: 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan: 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his plan."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, after Billy took his share, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two aquariums with an equal number of fish, denoted as x. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we determine the cost for each day of makeup application. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works for 6 hours a day. So, the cost per day is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since the makeup artist needs to be done 4 times a week, the weekly cost is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost for the makeup artist is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is completed, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount on the total cost. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1: 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jean paid: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid for Isabelle's little sister's birthday party, we need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies first.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cake, birthday presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, there are 3 people in total. 

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 / 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. To find the total weight of the onions, we multiply the number of bags by the weight per bag.

Total weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find the total cost. The cost per pound of onions is $1.50. To find the total cost, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound.

Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister.
- Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.
- Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
- Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies
- Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
- Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
- The difference in calories consumed = 9200 - 3600 = 5600

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that the school has 3 classes with 20 students in each class. So, the total number of students in the school is 20 * 3 = 60.

We're also given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

Now, we know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33. 

Now, let's find the number of boys in the third class. We know that the total number of boys in the school is 30, and the number of boys in the first two classes is 33. However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of students. This means that the given information is inconsistent.

However, if we assume that the given information is correct, then the number of boys in the third class is 33 - 30 = 3.

After deleting the apps, Travis downloaded 18 more. To find the total number of apps he has now, we add the downloaded apps to the remaining apps: 52 + 18 = 70.

The final number of apps on Travis's tablet is 70."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46.
The total number of cougars killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 
21 * 4 = 84.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. This means there are a total of 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 10 stalls. To find out how many cows each stall gets, we divide the total number of new cows by the number of stalls:

40 / 10 = 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

24 * 8 = 192

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section.

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight.

30% of 8000 is 0.3 * 8000 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

2. Andrea has 52 apples.
3. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
5. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
6. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then divide that by the number of cookies per cup of flour.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5. 

Since 5.5 dozens is the same as 5 dozen and 6 cookies, we need to calculate the flour needed for 6 cookies. 6 cookies is half of a dozen, so we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we need to add the flour needed for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. 5 dozen cookies need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

So, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to find the total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

We then subtract the total fees from the selling price to find the net selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Mico and Marco's current ages sum up to 20. To find their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages.

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as m. We know that M + m = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: (M + m) + 20. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute this into the expression to get 20 + 20 = 40.

However, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages, so we should add 20 to 20, not just 20 + 20. Therefore, the correct calculation is 20 + 20 = 40.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

The total cost is $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step. Maddy is buying pizza for her cousin's soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests. A pizza will serve 3 people. If each pizza costs $15, how many dollars will Maddy spend?

First, we need to find the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 
Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 
The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we need to find the total length of the space between the gemstones. 

Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

Now, we subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the spaces: 25 - 8 = 17 inches. However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: 1.75 / (1/4) = 1.75 / 0.25 = 7.

So, Katerina uses 7 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three family members: Alani, Braylen, and Margot. They each wrote a certain number of stories in the first week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. 
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.

To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we add the number of stories written by each family member.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

Alani doubled her stories from 20 to 20 * 2 = 40.
Braylen doubled his stories from 40 to 40 * 2 = 80.
Margot doubled her stories from 60 to 60 * 2 = 120.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = 120 + 240 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years, we first need to determine his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his age by multiplying Ann's age by 2.

Ann's age is 9 years, so her brother's age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

In 3 years, her brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's break down Kelly's initial amount. She has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 
Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

The total amount Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount she has. 

145 - 55 = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to find the total number of stars in the 8-star rows and 6-star rows.

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to find the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so we multiply the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone:

80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks, which is 2000 pounds per truck:

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, and the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, the car in the slow lane is traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Given that the car in the fast lane (and the car in the slow lane) traveled 480 miles, we can calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane as follows:
time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, so the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let x be the total number of medals given out. Then, 10x = 39 (since Ali and Izzy have 39 medals together).

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

The total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. There are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get: 16 / 8 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Susan's earnings for the online task. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break in between, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, let's convert the time to minutes. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Now, we can calculate her total earnings by multiplying the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the points of the three friends after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 21 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know the oldest son is 8 years old and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest. To find the youngest son's age, we divide the oldest son's age by 2: 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now that we know the ages of both sons, we can determine how many oranges they washed. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. In total, they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, we need to find out how many are left unwashed. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down Darren's workout routine over two days. 

On the first day, Darren does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

For the second day, he increases his pushups by 20, decreases his squats by 10, and doubles his dumbbell presses.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Total for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

The total count of activities in two days is 170 + 200 = 370."
"To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household with 5 members who eat rice every lunch and dinner, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sam has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so those two days don't count towards his sales. 

Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

Now, let's calculate how many crates he was off from his target.

Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Carmen starts with a bid of $200 and each subsequent bid increases by $50. There are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them. This means there are 3 bids from the other people, and then 3 bids from Carmen, making a total of 6 bids.

To find the total cost of the desk, we need to calculate the sum of these 6 bids. The first bid is $200, and each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. This forms an arithmetic series.

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 200, d = 50, and n = 6. Plugging in these values, we get:
S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

The final answer is: $1950"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into several parts.

First, let's find the total miles driven. Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 

Next, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he goes to work per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.

Now, we multiply the weekly miles by the number of weeks he works per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total driving cost per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

In addition to the driving cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus per year, we multiply the monthly bonus by 12: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Now, we add the total driving cost and the total bonus to find the total cost per year: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, let's consider how the pages are arranged after folding.

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper.

For a 32-page tabloid, we can consider the following arrangement:

- The first page (page 1) is on the left back.
- The second page (page 2) is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back.
- The 31st page is on the right front.

This pattern continues until we reach the middle of the paper, where the 16th page is on the left back and the 15th page is on the left front.

After the middle, the pattern reverses, with the 17th page on the right back and the 16th page on right front.

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, we need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages (left and right sides) and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages (left and right sides).

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 (for the first 16 pages) + 2 (for the last 16 pages) = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down Annika's expenses at the town fair. She started with $50. 

First, she spent half of it on food and snacks. Half of $50 is $25. 

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

"Let's break down the information given:

Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at $20, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45.

To find the total amount of money she earned in the second year, we need to first determine the number of books sold in the second year. We know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We also know that the number of books sold this year is 45, and the number of books sold in the first year is twice the number of books sold this year, which is 2 * 45 = 90.

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first year and this year from the total number of books sold: 200 - 45 - 90 = 65.

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = $1300.

The final answer is: $1300"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings in April, we need to determine his total hours worked and his total earnings from both his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. So, his total hours worked in a week are:
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Additionally, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

"Let's break down the information given: John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he lost to, we need to calculate the percentage of people he didn't beat, which is 20%.

20% of 20 people is the number of people John lost to. 

To find 20% of 20, we multiply 0.2 by 20.

0.2 * 20 = 4

So, John lost to 4 people.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we multiply 60 by 2/3.

60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. We subtract the morning sales from the total number of loaves produced.

60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we multiply the remaining loaves by 1/2.

20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, not 2 pounds. Since Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight in the same amount of time as Joey, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds by 4.

The number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds is 4. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we multiply 4 by 4: 4 * 4 = 16.

"To find the total savings, let's calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

- The person grows an extra arm every 3 days. 
- In 15 days, the person will grow 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Extra legs: 
- The person grows an extra leg every 5 days. 
- In 15 days, the person will grow 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

Total new limbs = extra arms + extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8

"Let's break down Theo's expenses for his business trip to South Africa.

First, he buys 6 business suits at $100 each, which costs 6 * $100 = $600. Then, he purchases 3 suitcases at $50 each, totaling 3 * $50 = $150. 

The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times this amount is $500. Adding the extra $700, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost so far: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Theo initially had $6000 for his trip. After spending $1950, he has $6000 - $1950 = $4050 left. He wants to save $2000, so he has $4050 - $2000 = $2050 left over for gifts.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a family of 5, and three of them eat 3 eggs each day, while the rest eat 2 eggs each day.

First, let's find out how many eggs the three people who eat 3 eggs each day consume in a day. That's 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs the rest of the family members consume in a day. There are 5 - 3 = 2 family members who eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a day, we add the eggs consumed by both groups: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to multiply the daily consumption by 7 to find the total number of eggs consumed in a week: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Noah's current age. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old. Since then, Noah has aged 6 years, so his current age is 20 + 6 = 26 years.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old at that time, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. This means the current population is twice the population six years ago, which is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's break down the problem. We have a football team with 105 members. The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, and the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. Then, the number of players on the offense is 2D, and the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

We can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people. 

First, we need to find the total number of people invited. 
2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

Now, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. 
24 - 8 = 16 people

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
So, 2 people had previous commitments and couldn't come.

Now, subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited.
16 - 2 = 14 people

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find this, we need to calculate 2/5 of 20. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find out how many people left, we need to calculate 1/4 of 40, which is 40 * 1/4 = 10.

Since 10 people left, the number of people remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were 25 men initially, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 (because 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men).

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider the weakening caused by both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening caused by the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and we want to cool it down by 65 degrees. 

The temperature difference is 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. So, the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since 5 ice cubes are added, the coffee becomes 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that 5 people came in with old records and left with 7 new records. Since they trade 2 old records for 1 new record, we need to find out how many old records they brought in.

Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the number of old records traded is twice the number of new records. 

Number of new records = 7
Number of old records traded = 2 * Number of new records
Number of old records traded = 2 * 7
Number of old records traded = 14

Since there are 5 people, and they all brought in the same number of old records, we can divide the total number of old records traded by 5 to find out how many old records each person brought in.

Number of old records per person = Number of old records traded / Number of people
Number of old records per person = 14 / 5
Number of old records per person = 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records.

Total number of old records = Number of old records per person * Number of people
Total number of old records = 2.8 * 5
Total number of old records = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of junior programmers. We know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. The total number of employees is 100, so we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100
= 2 * 20
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is the remaining employees:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers. Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Next, we need to find the salary of senior programmers. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so:

Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Finally, we can find the total amount paid to all programmers by adding the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. 

Before the third stop, 8 people got in at the second stop. So, at the second stop, there were 20 - 8 = 12 people on the bus.

At the second stop, 7 people got off, so before that, there were 12 + 7 = 19 people on the bus.

Now, we know that 5 people got in at the first stop. So, before the first stop, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

Since there were 14 people before the first stop, that means there were 14 people who got on the bus at the terminal.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down Oscar's lollipop adventure step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. On his way to school, he eats 2, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes 14 out to his friends, which brings his total down to 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

After school, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, Oscar eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, bringing his total down to 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to charge 40%, we multiply 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"Let's break down the customer's shopping trip. They spent $80 on their last trip, which earned them $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they earned 4 rewards, which is $4 off their current shopping trip.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, which is $4 off the price. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much they paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent: $43 - $12 = $31.

"Let's break down the information given for the two job options.

For Job A, we know the hourly wage is $15 and the total hours worked per year is 2000. To find the total income, we multiply the hourly wage by the total hours worked: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year.

Next, we need to calculate the income tax for Job A. The state has a 20% total tax rate, so we multiply the total income by the tax rate: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. Subtracting the income tax from the total income gives us the net income for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, we know the total annual income is $42,000. However, there's a property tax of $6,000 and a 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax. First, we subtract the property tax from the total income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Then, we calculate the income tax by multiplying the net income by the tax rate: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. Subtracting the income tax from the net income gives us the final net income for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, let's compare the net incomes of the two jobs to find the difference. We subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we first need to determine the total number of ruined castles. 40% of the 220 castles are ruins. 

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we need to divide the number of ruined castles by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

"Let's break down the two offers from Furniture United and Cozy Homes to determine the cost difference.

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment. The total amount paid in installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment. The total amount paid in installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers. Subtracting the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from Furniture United's offer, we get $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the price of the shares after the first year. The initial price of each share is $8, and it increases by 50%. To find the increase, we multiply the initial price by 0.5 (which is the same as 50%): 0.5 * $8 = $4. Then, we add the increase to the initial price: $8 + $4 = $12.

Now, we need to find the price of the shares after the second year. The price after the first year is $12, and it decreases by 25%. To find the decrease, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.25 (which is the same as 25%): 0.25 * $12 = $3. Then, we subtract the decrease from the price after the first year: $12 - $3 = $9.

Maria has 8 shares, and the price of each share after the second year is $9. To find the total value of all shares, we multiply the number of shares by the price per share: 8 * $9 = $72.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a class of 200 students that's split into 3 groups. Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two.

Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. So, we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x: 
70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals on his farm, and they are all either chickens or cows. We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, we can express this as H = 2C.

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation H + C = 60.

Substituting H = 2C into the second equation, we get 2C + C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Now that we know C = 20, we can find the value of H by multiplying C by 2, resulting in H = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

Week 2: 4 balls + 1 ball = 5 balls
Week 3: 5 balls + 1 ball = 6 balls
Week 4: 6 balls + 1 ball = 7 balls

So, Josh has 7 balls after 4 weeks of practice.

When Josh drops 3 balls on stage, 2 are caught by people in the crowd, but 1 is lost. To find out how many balls Josh has left, we need to subtract the lost ball from the total.

7 balls - 1 ball = 6 balls

Josh starts juggling with 6 balls on stage."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that a pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, a green toad, and that the yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog. We also know that the red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can determine the weights of the other animals as follows:

- The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of the animals and the container:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds

Now, let's subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs:
$400 - $275 = $125

Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the combined height of the two shorter trees. 

The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet. 
The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much Dean spent on toy cars. Since each toy car costs $2 and he bought 6 of them, the total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, we need to find out how much Dean spent on teddy bears. Since each teddy bear costs $1 and he bought 5 of them, the total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears to find the total amount Dean spent: $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially received $28 from his mother, and then he got an extra $10. So, the total amount of money he has now is $28 + $10 = $38.

Finally, let's subtract the amount Dean spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. 

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $35 = 1.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.57 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include Morgan's cost in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $55 - $5 = $50. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$50 / $35 = 1.43

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.43 ≈ 1

However, this is still incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the go-karts in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $50 - $20 = $30. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$30 / $35 = 0.86

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.86 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the mini-golf in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $30 - $5 = $25.

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
0.29 ≈ 0

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the cost of the arcade tokens in the remaining budget. The remaining budget is actually $10 - $5 = $5. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$5 / $35 = 0.14

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"Let's break down Marisa's daily expenses and savings. She gets $5 as pocket money every day and buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. 

First, we need to convert the cost of lollipops from cents to dollars. 
25 cents = $0.25
So, 4 lollipops cost 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day.
Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days.
Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Billy starts with $10 and buys candy at $1.5 per pound. After buying the candy, he takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs that cost $0.05 each. He buys 40 gumballs.

First, let's find out how much money Billy had left after buying the candy. If he spent x pounds of candy, the total cost of the candy is 1.5x. So, the amount of money he had left is 10 - 1.5x.

He then takes half of this amount and spends it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Carver is 45 years old, and his age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can represent his son's age as 'x'. 

The relationship between Carver's age and his son's age can be expressed as:
Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:
45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':
50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the distance from the third city to the first city. To do this, we add the distances from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city, then subtract 50 miles.

Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Combined distance: 75 + 100 = 175 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance traveled in one trip. 
Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 125 miles
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is:
Total distance in one trip: 300 miles
Total trips in a day: 3
Total distance in a day: 300 * 3 = 900 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we need to divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day.
Total distance between services: 18,000 miles
Total distance in a day: 900 miles
Number of days between services: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2. 
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 
Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip separately.

First, let's find the time taken to drive to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. 
Time taken to drive to friend's house = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.857 hours (approximately).

However, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance to his friend's house is 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles. 
Time taken to drive to friend's house with detour = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Next, let's find the time taken to drive back home. The distance back home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. 
Time taken to drive back home = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Now, we can find the total time taken for the trip by adding the time taken to drive to his friend's house and the time taken to drive back home.
Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to friend's house + Time taken to drive back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's start with the picture frames. Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20. Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to consider the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost, which is 20% of $20, or $4 per frame. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching together: $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will also receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Lastly, 1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will receive cords that cost $12 each. Since there are 44 seniors, 1/4 of that is 11. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the gifts: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"Let's break down the shoe sale. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double that number of shoes, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:
50 * 2 = 100

The final answer is: 100"

The total amount spent is $400,000. 
The value of the faulty pieces is 40% of $400,000. 
40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

Now, subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount spent:
$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

The final answer is: $240,000"
"Hi there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mary has 30 sheep. We need to find out how much milk she collects every day. To do this, we'll calculate the milk from half of the sheep and the other half separately and then add them together.

Half of the sheep: 30 / 2 = 15 sheep
Milk from half of the sheep: 15 * 1 kg = 15 kg

The other half of the sheep: 30 / 2 = 15 sheep
Milk from the other half of the sheep: 15 * 2 kg = 30 kg

Now, let's add the milk from both halves together: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls. After feeding her 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Now, she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces. To find out how many pieces she had in total, we multiply the number of rolls left by the number of pieces per roll: 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a class of 40 pupils. 

First, we find the number of pupils who like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, that's 40 / 2 = 20 pupils.

Now, we need to find the number of pupils who like green. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5.

So, the total number of pupils who like blue and green is 20 + 5 = 25.

To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils: 40 - 25 = 15.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest and then divide it by the number of months.

The total interest is calculated as: Principal * Rate * Time
Principal = $3,650
Rate = 10% or 0.10
Time = 5 months

Total interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5 = $1,825

The total amount to be paid is the principal + interest = $3,650 + $1,825 = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
$5,475 / 5 = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, with each pitcher holding 12 cups. This means she can make a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. So, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups to sell, she will spend 36 / 4 = 9 hours selling all the lemonade.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's solve the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. This means he has 2/5 of his land remaining.

To find the initial amount of land, we can set up an equation: (2/5)x = 12.8, where x is the initial amount of land.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how many people sang in the performance, we first need to determine the number of girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls.

However, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. This means that half of the girls can't make it, so we need to find half of 26, which is 26 / 2 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with the remaining girls. To find the total number of people performing, we add the number of girls who made it to the show (26 - 13 = 13) to the number of teachers (3). So, the total number of people performing is 13 + 3 = 16.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out the cost of the rides for Dasha. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides, the total cost for her is 9 * $4 = $36.

Now, let's look at David's option. He buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. This means he doesn't need to buy any additional tickets.

Since they both ride all 9 rides, the cost for Dasha is $36 and the cost for David is $30.

The amount of money David saves is $36 - $30 = $6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

To find the number of popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the ratio parts (5+6=11) and then multiply by the respective ratio parts.

Let's calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty's popsicles = (5/11) * 165 = 75
Sam's popsicles = (6/11) * 165 = 90

Now, let's find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty:
Difference = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15

"Let's break down the costs of the streaming services. The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to calculate the total time she spent working on the song and then determine what fraction of that total was spent editing.

First, let's convert all the time to the same unit. We'll use hours for this calculation. Carol spent 4 hours writing the song, half that time recording it, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours, and 90 minutes editing, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the total time spent working on the song: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we'll divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100: (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has a total of 40 cannolis. This means he initially has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan then bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 fewer corns than that, which is 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, let's add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought: 
Initial corns: 80
Initial cannolis: 40
Corns bought: 20
Cannolis bought: 60

Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100

"Let's break down Elliott's steps. He finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. Half of 10,000 is 5,000 steps. 

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and it averages 200 words per page, we can calculate the total number of words in the book.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Now, we can find the time it takes to read the book by dividing the total number of words by Toby's reading rate of 300 words per minute.

Time to read the book = Total words / reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so we need to add this to the time it takes to read the book to find out the total time Toby will be at the airport.

Total time at the airport = Time to read the book + Time to get to the airport = 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we can find out how many minutes early he will be by subtracting the time he arrives from the time he has to be there.

Time early = Time to be at the airport - Total time at the airport = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total amount paid to the employees in May. The company hired 40 employees, and each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks. So, the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

Next, we need to find the total amount paid to the employees in June. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months by adding the total amount paid in May and June. The total amount is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

First, Tim buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. So, the total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, he gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.2, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. To find the total amount spent, we add the discounted cost of the fireworks to the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply 2 by 30 to find the total number of cookies she will eat:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Now, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by the number of cookies her recipe makes. Her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, so we divide 60 by 12:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the conditions given. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

However, the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog. The more dangerous candles are the ones that are not guaranteed to not explode, which is 1% of the total candles. So, the number of more dangerous candles is 0.01 * 50000 = 500.

Now, we need to find 5% of the more dangerous candles, which is 0.05 * 500 = 25.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first calculate the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's call the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a herd consisting of camels and dromedaries. We know that there are 180 heads and 304 bumps in total.

First, let's consider the number of heads. Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is equal to the sum of the number of camels and the number of dromedaries. We can write this as an equation:

C + D = 180

Now, let's consider the number of bumps. Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each. So, the total number of bumps is equal to twice the number of camels plus the number of dromedaries. We can write this as another equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"Let's break down Tom's two-week-long trip through Europe. 

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

In the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is (30/100) * 800 km = 240 km. So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

In the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip: 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

The final answer is: 3140"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches (Zack's locker size)

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. To find Timothy's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2.

2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches (Timothy's locker size)

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb is, we need to determine the point where it landed after falling from his initial position. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

The final answer is: 3000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

To find the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. To find the total number of cats taken away, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat carried: 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the cost of the streaming service for Bill. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.

The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

Next, we're told that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Now, let's substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we get: 3T - 6 = 18.

Adding 6 to both sides, we get: 3T = 24.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip.

First, we need to find the capacity of the buses. There are 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each, so the total capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses. There are 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each, so the total capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

Lastly, we determine the capacity of the minivans. There are 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each, so the total capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others. We know that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Since the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, the homemade feeders must attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90. The total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"Let's break down the costs of Aleksandra's dinner. The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5. The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Kenny needs $50 to buy the amusement park ticket, and he plans to sell his Pokémon cards for $1.5 each. To find out how many cards he needs to sell, we can divide the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5
Number of cards sold = 33.33 (round down to 33 since you can't sell a fraction of a card)

However, Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.33

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to determine how many hotdogs were prepared. The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests were prepared for to have two hotdogs. This means 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests. 

However, the caterer prepared enough for the other half of the guests (also 18) to have one hotdog each. So, 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests. 

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were needed. 

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. This means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 6 + 7 = 13.

"Let's break down Charlotte's order to find the total cost. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

Now, let's add up the costs: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The items are 20% off, so we multiply the total cost by 0.20 to find the discount amount: 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"

"Let's break down the information given. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Three quarters of 100 is 75. 

Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons. Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce, having forgot his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. One-fifth of 150 is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8. 

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. 

1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons

Now we convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 0.75 by 8.

0.75 * 8 = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money George had initially. Since he spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money. This means 1% of his money is equal to $0.01, and 99% of his money is equal to $5 - $0.01 = $4.99.

Now, let's find out how much money George spent on chips. The cost of 3 bags of chips is 3 * 40 cents = $1.20.

The amount of money George spent on chips is $1.20. To find out how much he spent on candy bars, we subtract this from the total amount he spent: $4.99 - $1.20 = $3.79.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find the number of candy bars George bought by dividing the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: $3.79 / 0.75 = 5.0533.

Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to subtract the lollipops he kept from the total and then divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5, so the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

He shared these 20 lollipops with 4 friends, so each friend received 20 / 4 = 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rory makes a cake that weighs 20 ounces and cuts it into 8 equal pieces. Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find out how much cake is left.

First, we need to find the weight of each piece. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find the total weight of the cake they ate. 

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Now, they want to share these oranges with their 6 other friends, making a total of 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends) sharing the oranges.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:
56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"Let's break down the cost of Antoine's French onion soup. He needs 2 pounds of onions, but he wants to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, we need to divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving. $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's. So, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time difference between their arrival times.

If Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, and she needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.

However, since we want to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to subtract the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater from the time Bernadette needs to leave. So, Bernadette should leave 21 - 4 = 17 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how many beads each sister has and then determine the difference between their total bead counts.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has

"Let's break down the information given. We know Jon's times for the swim, bike, and run: 40 minutes, 80 minutes, and 50 minutes, respectively. 

To find James' total time, we need to consider the changes in his times. He finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, which means his swim time is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes. His bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find James' total time. We know Jon's total time is 170 minutes and he won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

To find James' run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:

For the six packets with 8 pieces each: 6 * 8 = 48
For the four packets with 16 pieces each: 4 * 16 = 64

Now, we add the number of crayons in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given:

You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?

Let's analyze the situation: If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If you buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total cost of filling 20 helium balloons was $900. To find the cost of filling one balloon, we need to divide the total cost by the number of balloons: 900 / 20 = 45.

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. Multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11050.

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance1 = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles
Distance2 = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles
Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jenna starts out with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. 

First, we need to find out how many sapphires she has left. To do this, we subtract the number of sapphires she traded from the total number of sapphires she started with: 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires.

Next, we need to find the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, we multiply the number of sapphires she has left by the value of each sapphire: 5 * $800 = $4000.

Now, we need to find the value of the rubies she received. Since each ruby is worth $1200, we multiply the number of rubies she received by the value of each ruby: 2 * $1200 = $2400.

Finally, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of her jewels: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"Let's break down the problem. Marin and his neighbor Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. To find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Since Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30:
8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one bed is length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to find the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"Let's break down the situation. Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies. Then, 20 minutes later, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined the group.

So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 

To find the number of fairies remaining, we subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total number of fairies: 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed he's buying. 

First, let's calculate the weight of each type of feed. 

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips.

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"Let's break down Grayson's recycling earnings. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. 

Aluminum cans are worth two cents each, so three cans are worth 3 * 2 = 6 cents. 
Plastic bottles are worth three cents each, so five bottles are worth 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

To find her weekly earnings, we add the value of the cans and bottles: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

Since there are four weeks in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the information given. We know Frederick has 10 plants. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:
Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the situation. Leila gave Ali half of her $100. To find out how much she gave him, we need to divide $100 by 2.

$100 / 2 = $50

So, Leila gave Ali $50. Now, we need to add this amount to the $21 Ali already had.

$21 + $50 = $71

Therefore, Ali now has $71.

The final answer is: $71"
"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate 1/5 of the cost of the pizza and add it to the cost of the pizza.

The cost of the pizza is $15. To find 1/5 of this amount, we multiply $15 by 1/5.

1/5 of $15 = (1/5) * $15
1/5 of $15 = $3

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man.

Total amount = Cost of the pizza + Tip
Total amount = $15 + $3
Total amount = $18

The final answer is: $18"

"Hi there, I'm Victor. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Each student gets 10 cards, so the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much Becky paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents. Since there's a $1 discount, we subtract 100 cents from the total cost: 900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 800 cents / 100 = $8.

Next, we need to find out how much Kelly paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents. Since there's a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of 1000 cents. To do this, we multiply 1000 cents by 0.1: 0.1 * 1000 cents = 100 cents. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: 1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 900 cents / 100 = $9.

Now that we know how much both Becky and Kelly paid, we can find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. We subtract Becky's total cost from Kelly's total cost: $9 - $8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply it by the total number of rooms.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Fireman Frank initially has 200 shoes. 

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes. Now, he has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes. Now, he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes. Now, he has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes left.

"To figure out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to determine how many cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, she can decorate 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Next, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide 48 by 12 to get the number of pans.

48 / 12 = 4

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the cost of the paper, we need to calculate three times the price of the pen and then subtract $1 from it.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

There are 30 students in Marissa's class, and each student started the year with 10 pencils. To find the total number of pencils initially in the class, we multiply the number of students by the number of pencils each student had.

Total pencils initially = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find the number of pencils used, we multiply the total pencils by 1/5.

Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils

Now, we subtract the pencils used from the total pencils to find the remaining pencils after two months.

Remaining pencils after two months = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find the number of pencils left, we multiply the remaining pencils by 1/3.

Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem. Matt's dad tells him he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can express this as an equation:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies."
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

This means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We're given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, which is equal to one-fourth of the total number of students.

We can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to isolate x:
x = 20 * 4
x = 80

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought in total. 

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to consider the total number of kids in the class and the number of kids allergic to dairy, peanuts, or both.

First, let's add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts, then subtract the number allergic to both to avoid double-counting. This is based on the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Number of kids allergic to dairy: 9
Number of kids allergic to peanuts: 6
Number of kids allergic to both: 3

Total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts (or both): 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything:
32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic kids) = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and add the number of tour guides.

There are 3 groups of 200 employees, so the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Each group has 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups, so the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

The total number of people going on the tour is 600 (employees) + 21 (tour guides) = 621.

The final answer is: 621"
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to find the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so the new price is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

"Let's break down the information given. Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, which means Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper also has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes together: 2 + 9 = 11.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we need to calculate three-quarters of 48 grains.

Three-quarters of 48 grains is (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains.

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains. To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we simply add the weights of the two pennies together: 36 + 48 = 84 grains.

First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. They picked a total of 60 oranges, and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. 

To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide the result by 5. 
60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Now, we need to find out how much money he gave up. He gave up $10 for each orange he ate, so we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.
24 * $10 = $240

"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20

"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first find out how many miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. 
So, miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles run in a week by his speed.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Uncle Ben has four horses, and each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal. Since he feeds his horses twice a day, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

To find the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day, we multiply the amount consumed by one horse by the number of horses: 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed for five days. We multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed by the weight of one bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs: 200 / 50 = 4.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Heather buys razors that come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. They are currently on sale for buy one get one free, which means she only pays for half the number of packs she buys. She also has a $2.00 coupon.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale. Since she only pays for half the number of packs, she pays for 1 pack, which is $4.00.

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost. The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"Let's break down the problem. Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends. However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). The cost of the second venue is $25x (per person charge).

We can set up the equation: 200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides: 200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20: 10 = x

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We can express the number of insects Lily found as B/2 + 7, since she found 7 more than David.

The total number of insects they collected is the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi, which is 43. We can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"To find the length of the couch, we need to find the width of the rug first. 

The chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. 
So, the rug's width = chair's width + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. 
Twice the width of the rug = 2 * 8 = 16 feet.
The couch is 2 feet longer than this, so the couch's length = 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"Let's break down the information given:

Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She got 2 packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, we need to find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost.

Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

Since the total cost is $7, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out which type of wood gives the most popsicle sticks per dollar. 

A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and gives 200 sticks, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50.
A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and gives 400 sticks, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67 (round down to 66.67 since we can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood).

Since 66.67 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood I can buy with my $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

10 trips * $2.20 per trip = $22.00 per week

Now, let's compare this to the cost of a weekly bus pass, which is $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from her weekly expenses.

$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals: 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. We can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

However, this equation is not necessary. We can simply use the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. This means that the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 1/4 of the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.

The total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. To find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can divide this total by 4:
16 / 4 = 4

So, Sophia bought 4 onions and potatoes in total.

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we first need to calculate the number of days he has to lose the weight. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5 calories per day.

First, let's calculate the total distance Hannah will run:
8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink:
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down Julie's expenses step by step.

First, Julie spent 20% of her initial $500 on clothes. To find 20% of $500, we multiply 0.2 by $500, which equals $100. So, she spent $100 on clothes.

Now, we subtract $100 from the initial $500 to find the remaining money: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find 25% of $400, we multiply 0.25 by $400, which equals $100. So, she spent $100 on CDs.

Now, we subtract $100 from the remaining $400 to find the final amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem. We're given that a house and a lot cost $120,000 together. It's also stated that the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the canvas bags. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. To find the total number of bags, we multiply the number of packs by the number of bags in each pack: 8 * 5 = 40 bags. 

Now, we multiply the total number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost: 40 bags * $4 = $160.

Next, we need to find the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so we multiply the number of bags by the selling price: 40 bags * $8 = $320.

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight in minutes and multiply it by the average number of punches he throws per minute.

The fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Suzanne made 36 cookies. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can find out how many cookies Josh made by dividing 36 by 4.

36 / 4 = 9

So Josh made 9 cookies. Now, we need to find out how many cookies Kelsie made. We know Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find this out, we multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 
Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

Next, Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner:
3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) * $80 = $48
Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. To find out how long it takes him in minutes, we need to convert 2 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Now, we're told that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. To find out how long Royce takes, we need to calculate double the time it takes Rob and then add 40 minutes. Double the time it takes Rob is 2 * 120 = 240 minutes. Adding 40 minutes to that gives us 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total for each item and then add them together.

For the hats, it takes 2 skeins of wool per hat, and Martha has 3 grandchildren, so she'll need 3 * 2 = 6 skeins of wool for the hats.

For the scarves, it takes 4 skeins of wool per scarf, and Martha has 3 grandchildren, so she'll need 3 * 4 = 12 skeins of wool for the scarves.

For the sweaters, it takes 12 skeins of wool per sweater, and Martha has 3 grandchildren, so she'll need 3 * 12 = 36 skeins of wool for the sweaters.

For the mittens, it takes 1 skein of wool per pair, and Martha has 3 grandchildren, so she'll need 3 * 1 = 3 skeins of wool for the mittens.

For the socks, it takes 2 skeins of wool per pair, and Martha has 3 grandchildren, so she'll need 3 * 2 = 6 skeins of wool for the socks.

Now, let's add the total number of skeins needed for each item: 6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins.

The final answer is: 63"
"Let's break down Chris's math homework progress. He starts with 100 math problems to complete.

On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems. 

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of problems Chris has to complete is 100. Therefore, the number of problems remaining after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

The number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 100 - 61 = 39.

"It's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm.  Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour, while Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.  Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, and Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy.

To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to find the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

"To find out how many loaves of bread the Beverly Hills Bakery has left, we need to calculate the total number of loaves sold and then subtract that from the initial number of loaves baked.

First, let's find the total number of loaves sold. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. 

Total loaves sold = 93 + 39 = 132

Now, we need to subtract the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves sold. The grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves.

Total loaves left = Total loaves baked - Total loaves sold - Loaves returned
Total loaves left = 200 - 132 - 6
Total loaves left = 62

The number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"Let's break down the problem. Jackson is planting tulips, and he can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. He buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips.

To find the number of rows of red tulips, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. 

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be used for the granola and snack mix. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. So, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

"To find out how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to first determine how many days it would take for them to complete the job.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, as their combined work rate is 5 times faster. 

Since 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days, as 2 halves make a whole.

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for a total of $48. To find out how many more CDs he could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to first determine how much money he spent on the headphone set.

Total money spent = $48
Money spent on the CD = $4
Money spent on the headphone set = Total money spent - Money spent on the CD
Money spent on the headphone set = $48 - $4 = $44

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.
Money spent on the headphone set = $44
Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = Money spent on the headphone set / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought = $44 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 11

Next, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CD.
Total money = $48
Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = Total money / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought = $48 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 12

Now, let's find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = Number of CDs that could have been bought - Number of CDs that actually bought
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 12 - 1
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 11

"Let's break down Josh's workout routine. He spent 4 hours working out every week except for a few occasions. There was a period where he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, and another time he spent 6 hours in one week.

To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours, the weeks where he spent 5 hours, and the week where he spent 6 hours.

For the weeks where he spent 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (since 8 - 2 = 6). 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week where he spent 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add up the total hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Now, let's find out how many passengers get on at the second stop. 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times the number of passengers who got off (21) fewer passengers get on. 3 times 21 is 63, so 63 fewer passengers get on. Since we are looking for the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. Instead, we should interpret this as 63 more passengers got on, because you can't have a negative number of passengers.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is:
59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age:
   Difference = Jame's current age - cousin's current age
             = 22 - 47
             = -25

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference:
   Difference = | -25 |
             = 25

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer = $2,400
2. Cost of the computer = $1,100
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, we need to find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there are 20 kids in total, and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys went out for the scavenger hunt and brought back 60 shells each. To find the total number of seashells brought by the boys, we multiply the number of boys by the number of shells each brought: 10 * 60 = 600.

Now, we need to find the number of seashells brought by the girls. The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 (the number of shells brought by the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times the number of shells brought by the boys) seashells.

First, we calculate four times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add the number of shells brought by the boys to this result: 60 + 240 = 300.

So, the girls brought 300 more seashells than the boys. To find the total number of seashells brought by the girls, we add this to the total number of seashells brought by the boys: 600 + 300 = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls to find the number of seashells brought by each girl: 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"

4. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so x - 5 = 3.
5. Solving for x, we get x = 8.
6. Since Nick had 2x candies initially, Nick has 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

"To find Anne's age, we need to find Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we subtract 4 from Chenny's age to get Alyana's age.

Chenny is 10 years old, so Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6.

Now, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we add 2 to Alyana's age to get Anne's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, which means it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 = 81
81 + 45 = 126
126 + 62 = 188

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to get his initial share. $18 / 3 = $6.

Next, he added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

Then, he added another $10, bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21.

However, he needed some money and spent $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he saved some more and was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. To do this, we multiply $13 by 3, which gives us $13 * 3 = $39.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we need to determine the amount he saves each day in the first half and then double it.

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's denote the amount saved in the first half as y. Then, the amount saved in the second half will be 2y.

The total amount saved in the first half is xy, and the total amount saved in the second half is 2xy.

The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation: 3xy = 1125.

Since x is the number of days in the first half, and the total number of days in April is 30, we can write x + (30 - x) = 30, which simplifies to 30 = 30, and this equation is true for any value of x. However, we know that x cannot be 0 or 30, so we can assume x = 15.

Now we can substitute x = 15 into the equation 3xy = 1125 to find y: 3(15)y = 1125, which simplifies to 45y = 1125.

To find y, we divide both sides by 45: y = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

The final answer is: $50"

Next, she bought five oranges at $0.80 each, which is a total of 5 x $0.80 = $4. 

Lastly, she bought six peaches at $0.75 each, which is a total of 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jairus gets $0.8 for each task he completes, and Jenny gets $0.5 for each task she completes. Both of them finished 20 tasks.

To find out how much Jairus will get in total, we multiply the amount he gets per task by the number of tasks he completed: 0.8 * 20 = $16.

Similarly, to find out how much Jenny will get in total, we multiply the amount she gets per task by the number of tasks she completed: 0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jairus' total and Jenny's total to see how much more Jairus will get than Jenny. The difference is $16 - $10 = $6.

"Let's break down the problem. Jeff and Brad are trying to divide 100 dollars between them. It's mentioned that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of what Jeff and Brad get is 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, this means she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 letters.

Then, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters from the first two times, and the 13 letters from the third time. So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. So, the total number of letters she has written is 65 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: 130"
"Let's break down the phone tree scenario. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 

In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 * 3 = 9 families are notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 * 3 = 27 families are notified.

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 * 3 = 81 families are notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and add it to his final weight. 

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down the problem. We know James's play set has 80 toys, and the larger play set is five times larger. To find the total number of toys in the larger play set, we multiply 80 by 5.

80 * 5 = 400

Now, we're told that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item first.

- 5 notebooks at $1.50 each: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
- 2 pens at $0.25 each: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
- 1 calculator at $12 each: 1 * $12 = $12
- 1 geometry set at $10 each: 1 * $10 = $10

The total cost without the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Now, apply the 10% discount to the total cost. 
10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

The final answer is: $27"
"Let's break down the costs of Carly's order. She buys five hamburgers at $4 each, which is 5 x $4 = $20. Then, she buys ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each, which is 10 x $0.30 = $3. Lastly, she buys five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each, which is 5 x $2 = $10.

The total cost of the items is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33. Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission. This is calculated as 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

The amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500. For this amount, she earns an additional 10% commission, which is 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Now, we add the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the sales over $1000 to get the total commission: $300 + $150 = $450.

The total amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"To figure out how many water bottles Bill needs to buy for his party, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he requires. 

Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has a total of 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

He wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, so he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles for his guests.

In total, Bill needs 140 (for guests) + 48 (he already has) = 188 bottles.

Since Bill already has 48 bottles, he needs to buy 188 - 48 = 140 additional bottles.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how long Ray takes to swim a mile on a hot day, we need to calculate twice the time it takes him to swim a mile on a cold day and add 2 minutes to it. 

Time to swim a mile on a cold day = 16 minutes
Twice the time = 2 * 16 = 32 minutes
Time to swim a mile on a hot day = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day.

Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes
Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes

Now, we can find the difference in time between the two days.

Difference in time = Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day - Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day
= 102 - 48
= 54 minutes

"Let's break down John's situation. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. To find out his daily earnings, we multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a day:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Since John works 4 days a week, we need to calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a week:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, we can determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80 by dividing the target savings by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

"Let's break down the problem. We have a bag of buttons with 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each, and the rest have 4 holes each.

First, let's find the number of buttons with 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 have 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes: 7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes.

Next, let's calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes: 14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes.

To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we add the holes from the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to find the size of Zack's locker first, and then find half of that size.

Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Zack's locker is 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.

Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so Peter's locker is 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and her husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. 

Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. 
Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.
Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

We are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. 
So, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"Let's break down the information given. The pet shop has 6 cages of rodents, with 3 of them containing hamsters and the other 3 containing guinea pigs. We know that each cage with hamsters has 10 hamsters and each cage with guinea pigs has 5 guinea pigs.

To find the total number of hamsters, we multiply the number of cages with hamsters by the number of hamsters per cage: 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters.

Next, we find the total number of guinea pigs by multiplying the number of cages with guinea pigs by the number of guinea pigs per cage: 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs.

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the overall number of rodents: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to find their total weight and divide it by 3.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

The total weight of the 3 friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

The average weight of the 3 friends is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to figure out how many candles he needs. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are one per year of age, so James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy.

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the total pages she read in the first week and then add it to the pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew. 

Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x. 

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7. 

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.
This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.
This simplifies to x = 10.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to first calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses ordered per week is: 
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:

"To find the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost. The bread costs $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. The cheese and condiments cost $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need to buy 1 set of cheese and condiments.

Total cost = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.

Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to consider the area of the bedroom, the cost of the materials, and the cost of labor.

First, let's find the area of the bedroom. The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the materials. The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592. The padding costs $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432. The total cost of the materials is $2592 + $432 = $3024.

Next, let's calculate the cost of labor. The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864. The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344. The total cost of labor is $864 + $7344 = $8208.

Finally, let's add the cost of the materials and labor to find the total cost of replacing the carpet. The total cost is $3024 + $8208 = $11232.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to first determine how many pairs of contacts Pete will have. Since 90 single use contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of pairs of contacts he uses per day. 

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of:
2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

The total number of days the contacts will last is:
180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, he will use a total of 180 contacts. This means he will have 90 pairs of contacts.

The cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is:
2 boxes * $100/box = $200
10% discount = $200 * 0.10 = $20
$200 - $20 = $180

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts:
$180 / 90 pairs = $2 per pair

"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total calories she burns from aerobics and running.

Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour, and she spends 2 hours doing it, so she burns 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics.

Running burns 600 calories per hour, and she spends 1 hour doing it, so she burns 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running.

The total calories burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units there are.

1600 / 200 = 8

Since each 200-calorie unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100.

"Let's dive into the problem. We have a jar containing red, blue, and green jelly beans. The note on the jar says that it contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. We can express the total number of jelly beans as B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3.01B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3.01:
B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to add up all the measurements and divide by 3.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM.
His second typing speed is 52 WPM.
His third typing speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, let's add up all the measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given two scenarios: eating Cheerios for breakfast, which results in a weight loss of 1.25 pounds per week, and eating donuts for breakfast, which results in a weight gain of 1.75 pounds per week.

To find the difference in weight after 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option. 

Weight lost per week: -1.25 pounds
Weight gained per week: 1.75 pounds

Now, let's calculate the weight change after 5 weeks:
-1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds (lost)
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds (gained)

The difference in weight is the result of the weight gained minus the weight lost: 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the information given. Alex invites 100 people via email, and each of them invites 2 friends. This means the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. So, the total number of people invited by Alex's friends is 10 + 8 = 18.

To find the total number of people attending, we add the people invited via email and the people invited by Alex's friends: 300 + 18 = 318.

However, this count includes Alex herself, so we need to add 1 to the total to account for her.

The final answer is: 319"
"Let's break down the weights of the dogs in the waiting room. The first dog is an Affenpinscher, weighing 10 pounds. The Dachshund next to him weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, which is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon sitting next to the Dachshund weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so it's 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Now, let's find the weight of the Mastiff at the end of the line. It weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, which is 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"Let's break down the costs of the boots on both Amazon and eBay.

The boots on Amazon cost $16, and shipping costs $4. So, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, but shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we need to first determine how much protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem. We're given that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. If we denote Jerry's current age as 'x', we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since he needs 2 implants, the total base price is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a triangle, and we know that the sum of its three angles is 180 degrees. One angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle.

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Then, the other two angles are 2x and 3x.

The sum of the three angles is x + 2x + 3x = 180. Combining like terms, we get 6x = 180.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

Since we're looking for the largest angle, we compare the three angles: 30, 60, and 90 degrees. The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in cents. 

8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

The final answer is: 69"
"Let's calculate the total number of legs in the pet store. 

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.

"Let's break down Steve's game collection over the 3 years.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 24 = 29 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 48 = 53 games in the third year.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. Since he makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, we can divide 120 by 2 to get the hourly rate. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates per hour for Ruiz.

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. It's given that she makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 

To find Marissa's hourly rate, we multiply Ruiz's hourly rate by 3/4. 
60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds of chocolates per hour for Marissa.

Now that we have the hourly rates for both Ruiz and Marissa, we can find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"

To find the total amount he spent, we add these amounts together: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Since Howard originally had $100, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount to find out how much he has left: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many cups of lemonade Patrick sold in the first four hours. Since he sold 15 cups per hour, we multiply the number of cups sold per hour by the number of hours: 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups.

Next, we calculate the total amount earned from the first four hours. Since each cup costs $0.50, we multiply the total number of cups by the price per cup: 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

Now, let's move on to the next two hours. Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. We calculate the total cups sold in two hours by multiplying the number of cups sold per hour by the number of hours: 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.

Then, we find the total amount earned from the next two hours by multiplying the total number of cups by the price per cup: 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

Finally, we add the total amount earned from the first four hours and the next two hours to get the total amount earned in six hours: $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires can handle in a month and then divide that by the total number of rotations allowed.

First, we find the number of rotations per month by multiplying the miles driven per month by the rotations per mile. 

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Now, we divide the total rotations allowed by the rotations per month to find the number of months the tires can last.

Total rotations allowed = 10,440,000 rotations
Rotations per month = 290,000 rotations/month

Months before replacement = Total rotations allowed / Rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 / 290,000
Months before replacement = 36

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12
Years before replacement = 36 / 12
Years before replacement = 3

The final answer is: 3"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price, which is $25. To find 30% of $25, we multiply 0.3 by $25, which equals $7.5.

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt by subtracting the discount from the original price: $25 - $7.5 = $17.5.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the items. We add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.5 + $35 = $52.5.

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately. Now, let's find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase. We subtract the total cost from the amount Joe has: $50 - $52.5 = -$2.5.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.5"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need to make croissants, we need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make and then multiply it by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of croissants is:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, the total number of croissants is:
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

John initially receives $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. After that, his research takes 10 times longer, which means it lasts for 5 * 10 = 50 months.

For the first 5 months, the cost is a straightforward $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months, the funding increases by 50% of the initial amount, which is $50,000. So, the new funding per month is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000.

To find the total cost for the remaining 45 months, we multiply the new funding by the number of months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Now, we add the cost for the first 5 months to the cost for the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a tow truck pulled 10 cars for each of the first three days. So, the total number of cars towed on those days is 10 * 3 = 30.

Now, let's consider the remaining days of the week. There are 7 days in a week, and the tow truck pulled 10 cars for the first 3 days. So, the remaining days are 7 - 3 = 4 days.

On each of these remaining days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than the initial 10. So, the number of cars towed on each of these days is 10 - 4 = 6. The total number of cars towed on these days is 6 * 4 = 24.

To find the total number of cars towed that week, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining days: 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between his current height and the required height, and then divide that by his growth rate.

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the required height is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Adam's current height is 40 inches, and he grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height, we subtract his current height from the required height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Now, we divide the difference in height by his growth rate: 8 / 2 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the required height and ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down James' earnings from selling the used cars.

First, we need to find the total cost of the cars. Since James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, the total cost is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we need to calculate the company's cost to acquire the cars. They paid 30% of the total cost, which is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

Now, we can find the profit from selling the cars by subtracting the company's cost from the total cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, James gets a 10% commission on the profit. His commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 to get the total number of riders who can stay upright:
100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we need to find the number of men who can stay upright. Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is:
25 - 15 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, and the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell, we can calculate the price of the gold Jewell as follows:

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Given that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold, we can calculate the price of the silver Jewell as follows:

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to find the number of truck and rose stamps first.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Max bought: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how long it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed between them and then divide the distance between them by this relative speed.

The relative speed is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.

The distance between them is 75 miles.

"Let's break down the problem. Manny signed up for 10 Karate classes for a total of $60. His parents told him that if the classes cost more than $10 per class, they won't sign him up again. We need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again.

Since Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's say Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and y classes at $10 per class. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

6x + 10y = 60

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 1, 6(1) + 10y = 60
6 + 10y = 60
10y = 54
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 6(2) + 10y = 60
12 + 10y = 60
10y = 48
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 6(3) + 10y = 60
18 + 10y = 60
10y = 42
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 4, 6(4) + 10y = 60
24 + 10y = 60
10y = 36
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

The maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem. We know Jewel processes 50 customers per day. To find her weekly production, we multiply this number by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie's daily production is 50 * 2 = 100 customers.

Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"Let's break down the information given. Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which means Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

"To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to multiply the cost of 4 apples by 5/4. 
Cost of 4 apples = $5.20
Cost of 5 apples = $5.20 * (5/4) = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to multiply the cost of 3 oranges by 5/3.
Cost of 3 oranges = $3.30
Cost of 5 oranges = $3.30 * (5/3) = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

"To find the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the hole) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can find the total time it will take him to dig the hole by multiplying the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Let's break down Tim's new compensation package. He's getting a 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary, which is a significant boost. To calculate the raise, we multiply his current salary by 0.05:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
This means his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

In addition to the raise, Tim is also receiving a bonus worth half a month's salary. Since half of $20,000 is $10,000, his total monthly income will be:
Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:
Total annual income = Total monthly income * 12 = $31,000 * 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"
"Let's break down the costs of James' new wardrobe.

First, we need to find the cost of the suits. James bought 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, which is $750 * 1/5 = $150 per pair. Since James bought 10 pairs of dress pants, the total cost of the pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James bought 3 dress shirts for each of the 10 suits, so he bought a total of 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we add up the costs of the suits, pants, and shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Fishio initially posted a selfie on Instagram and received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes increased to 70 times the initial number of likes. This means the number of likes after 3 weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140000.

However, we are not given the number of likes received in the 3 weeks between the initial post and the 3-week mark. Instead, we are told that Fishio received 20000 more new likes recently. To find the total number of likes after the 3-week mark, we need to subtract the initial likes from the likes at the 3-week mark: 140000 - 2000 = 138000.

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the total number of likes after the 3-week mark: 138000 + 20000 = 158000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. However, she got a $2 discount because she had a voucher. So, the total cost is:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate shot up to $30, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is:
20 * $30 = $600
The discount is 10% of $600, which is:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
So, the total cost with the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$540 - $398 = $142

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In a particular month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total sales from green hats in that month ""x"". Then, the sales from red hats in that month is $400, which is half of x, so x/2 = $400.

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = $400 * 2 = $800.

So, in that month, Ariadne's total sales from green hats were $800 and from red hats were $400.

The total sales in that month are $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves she needs to make. We already know she needs 48 deviled egg halves.

Number of deviled egg halves needed: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Lee has sheep and geese on his farm, and the total number of animal legs is 70. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can represent the total number of legs as 4S + 2G = 70, where S is the number of sheep and G is the number of geese.

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, we can represent the total number of heads as S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation, we get 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

Total time = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
= 60 * 6
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know Aurelia has $120. 
Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.
Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, we need to add up the money of all three and divide it by 3 to find out how much each person would have if they shared it equally. 
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.
Money per person = 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to add the length of the four regular quarters and the extra five minutes. 

Each quarter is 12 minutes long, and there are 4 quarters. So, the total length of the regular quarters is 4 * 12 = 48 minutes.

Since the game was extended for five minutes, we need to add this to the total length of the regular quarters. 

48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

The final answer is: 53"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given a company with 50 employees, and 20% of them are management. To find the number of management employees, we multiply 50 by 0.2.

50 * 0.2 = 10

Now, we're told that only 30% of these management employees oversee the entire company. To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we multiply the number of management employees by 0.3.

10 * 0.3 = 3

So, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for 16 muffins.

For 16 muffins, the amount of flour needed is 16 * 5 = 80 tablespoons.
The amount of sugar needed is 16 * 3 = 48 tablespoons.
The amount of salt needed is 16 * 0.25 = 4 tablespoons.

Now, we add the amounts of flour, sugar, and salt together to get the total amount of dry ingredients needed: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

The final answer is: 132"
"Let's break down the problem. We have three people - Robert, Cindy, and Aaron - and we know how much candy each of them has. To find out how much candy each of them would have after sharing, we need to add up the total amount of candy they have and then divide it by the number of people.

Robert has 3 pounds of candy, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. 

Total candy = Robert's candy + Cindy's candy + Aaron's candy
Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4
Total candy = 12 pounds

There are 3 people sharing the candy, so we divide the total candy by 3:
12 / 3 = 4

Each of them would have 4 pounds of candy after sharing."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B. The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, and the cost of one candy of type B is $0.75.

First, we need to find the total cost of the type A candies: 7 candies * $0.5 = $3.5. Then, we calculate the total cost of the type B candies: 10 candies * $0.75 = $7.5.

Now, we add the costs of both types of candies together: $3.5 + $7.5 = $11. This is the total amount Adam spent on candies.

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, we need to find the change he got. To do this, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid: $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"Let's break down Christina's mood records. We know that over the past thirty days, she had twelve good days and eight bad days, with the rest being neutral. The first eight days were good, the next eight days were bad, and the third eight days were neutral.

Now, let's consider the next three days: good, neutral, and good. We need to find out how many good days were left in the month.

We already know that the first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good. So, the total number of good days we know about is 8 + 3 = 11. However, we know that Christina had 12 good days in total. 

To find the number of good days left, we subtract the known good days from the total number of good days: 12 - 11 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Let's break down the problem. We're told that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, we can represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. 

The relationship between Janey's and Sally's books can be expressed as: Janey's books = 2x + 3. Since we know Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation 2x + 3 = 21.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 21 - 3, which simplifies to 2x = 18.

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x': x = 18 / 2, which gives us x = 9.

So, Sally has 9 books."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mrs. Jameson's bamboo grows 30 inches a day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we first need to convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 4 + 8 = 12.

When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. This brings the total number of dogs to 4 + 8 + 16 = 28. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12 + 28 = 40.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means the total number of toys needed is 40 - 3 = 37.

The final answer is: 37"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we can calculate this as follows: (2/5) * 1200 = 480.

Now, we need to find out how much money was left after Dylan's investment. This is simply 1200 - 480 = 720.

Next, we need to find out how much Frances invested. Since Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, we can calculate this as follows: (2/3) * 720 = 480.

Now, we need to find out how much money was left after Frances' investment. This is simply 720 - 480 = 240.

So, Skyler's investment is 240.

The final answer is: $240"
"Hi there, I'm Victor. I'd be happy to help the sisters, Carol and Jennifer, figure out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach their goal.

Let's start by calculating the total number of signatures they have so far. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the total signatures they have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect per week to reach their goal.

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

The sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of 100 signatures."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows: 

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

We can then cross-multiply to solve for x:

6x = 96 * 36
6x = 3456
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: 576"
"To find out how much the group of adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 adults and then subtract the maximum load.

The weight of one adult is 80 kg, and there are 9 adults in total. 

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

The elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg. To find the excess weight, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight of the 9 adults.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Max has 5 less cookies than Katarina, we can find Max's total by subtracting 5 from Katarina's cookies: 68 - 5 = 63 cookies for Max.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we subtract 12 from Max's total: 63 - 12 = 51 cookies for the Cookie Monster.

Now, we know Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. To find Summer's total, we add 23 to Max's total: 63 + 23 = 86 cookies for Summer.

To find the total number of cookies, we add up the number of cookies each person has: 68 (Katarina) + 63 (Max) + 51 (Cookie Monster) + 86 (Summer) = 268.

The final answer is: 268"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the final design of the dress is 140cm long, and this includes a 20cm addition at the bottom. To find the original length of the dress, we need to subtract the added length from the final length.

First, let's find the original length of the dress before the 20cm addition. We can do this by subtracting 20cm from the final length: 140cm - 20cm = 120cm.

However, this is the length after the 50% extension. To find the original length, we need to account for the 50% extension. Let's call the original length 'x'. The extension is 50% of x, which is 0.5x.

We can set up the equation: x + 0.5x = 120.

Combine like terms: 1.5x = 120.

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Chris has a two-speed lawn mower. He can mow his entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. Alternatively, he can mow the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode in 40 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to calculate the time it took for each mode and then add them together. To find the time for each mode, we multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

"Let's break down the problem. John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school together. They need to get to the corner where the library is first, which takes 6 minutes. Then, it takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have. 

Time to get to the fire station = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Time left to get to school = Total time they have - Time to get to the fire station
Time left to get to school = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left to get to school = 11 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, we need to find the age of one of the twins.

Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

We have two equations based on the given information:

1. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, we need to find the age of the older twin. 

The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies that cost a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. 

First, we need to find the cost of one candy. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. Since the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20, the cost of 4 candies is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of 4 candies by 4. The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10 and the cost of one candy by 10. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Rong saves 20 coins every month, and Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we need to calculate 2/5 of 20, which is 8. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the vaccines. Since John's dog needs 2 vaccines at $20 each, the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

Next, we know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits in it. 

First, let's find the cost of one banana, which is twice as much as an apple. Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we find the cost of one orange, which is three times as much as a banana. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function at Mia's restaurant. To find out how many chairs are needed, we add the number of adults and babies together.

Total number of chairs needed = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57

The restaurant has 8 high chairs. We're told that it has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, to find the number of regular chairs, we multiply the number of high chairs by 5.

Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs available.

Total number of chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs needed.

Number of chairs needed to be added = 57 - 48 = 9

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know there are 8 males and 6 females in the group. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, we can determine the number of dumplings each male and female ate.

Each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

The total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

To find the total number of dumplings eaten, we add the number of dumplings eaten by females and males: 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = Speed of the turtle * 40
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to determine how much they raise per hour. They've raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. To find the hourly rate, we divide the total amount raised by the number of hours: $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they've already raised $2100. The remaining amount is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

To find the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they've already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add the additional hours to the initial 3 hours: 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Now, we need to find out what percentage of this 40% is used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we need to find out how much of the 40% is used for industrial purposes. Since 80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes, we can calculate this as 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 
40% - 32% = 8%.

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to first find the total number of days in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks will have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, we multiply the number of days by the daily charge: 
14 days * $12/day = $168

The final answer is: $168"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two types of ice cream being produced: chocolate and vanilla.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate of chocolate ice cream, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

Now, let's look at the production rate of vanilla ice cream. The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate of vanilla ice cream, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now that we have the production rates for both types of ice cream, we can calculate the total quarts produced in 48 hours. For chocolate ice cream, it would be 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts. For vanilla ice cream, it would be 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts.

To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream together: 2400 + 600 = 3000.

The final answer is: 3000"
"Let's break down Marcus' order. He bought 5 croissants at $3.00 each, which is a total of 5 * $3.00 = $15.00. 

He also purchased 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, totaling 4 * $2.50 = $10.00.

Additionally, he bought 3 mini quiches for $4.00 each, which amounts to 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.

Lastly, he bought 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each, making it 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount, we multiply $50.00 by 0.10, which equals $5.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"Let's break down the deal at the ice cream parlor. Erin can buy 2 scoops of ice cream and get 1 free. Each scoop costs $1.50. 

To find out how many scoops Erin can buy, we need to calculate the total number of scoops she can get with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so Erin can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. 

To take advantage of the deal, Erin should buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops. 

The remaining $1.50 can be used to buy 1 more scoop, making it a total of 4 scoops.

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two people, Ginger and Amy, who both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day.

To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount. Two weeks is equal to 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Now, let's calculate how much candy each person has left. Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we first need to calculate two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom. 

Two thirds of 36 is calculated as (2/3) * 36 = (2 * 36) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24.

So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 sq ft. 

For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 sq ft, he would need 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"Let's break down the cost of James' blueberry picking adventure. He had to pay $20 to get started, and then it cost him $1.5 per pound for the blueberries. Since he picked 30 pounds, the total cost for the blueberries is $1.5 * 30 = $45. Adding the initial cost, the total cost for picking the blueberries is $20 + $45 = $65.

Now, let's compare this to buying the blueberries at the store. The store sells them for $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds, so the total cost at the store would be $2.5 * 30 = $75.

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store: $75 - $65 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"

"Let's break down the situation. Ron is worried about a pothole in front of his house that's going to cause $450 worth of damage to his car if it's not fixed. However, if he decides to fix it himself, the city council will fine him $120 for unauthorized road maintenance. Additionally, he'll need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of the asphalt. Since he needs 3 buckets, the total cost is 3 * $25 = $75.

Now, we add the fine for unauthorized road maintenance to the cost of the asphalt: $120 + $75 = $195.

This means that fixing the pothole will cost Ron a total of $195. To find out how much money he saves, we subtract this cost from the potential damage to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 chairs for babies. If 20 of the normal chairs and 13 of the baby chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair, we can calculate the total chairs left as follows:

Total normal chairs = 170
Total baby chairs = 23

Total chairs sent for repair = 20 (normal) + 13 (baby) = 33

Total chairs left = Total normal chairs - 20 + Total baby chairs - 13
Total chairs left = 170 - 20 + 23 - 13
Total chairs left = 150 + 10
Total chairs left = 160

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends). 

First, let's find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 3 people as follows:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, let's find the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. They ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we add the total number of slices eaten by all 5 people to find the total number of slices eaten:

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

Total number of slices = 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

However, we know that Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which is 8 slices each (2/3 * 12 = 8). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 3 people is:

3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

42 slices - 24 slices = 18 slices

Now, we know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

Total number of slices = 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices
Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. To make calculations easier, we'll convert this to just inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply 8 by 12 to get 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches to that gives us a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

- Number of windows per car: 4
- Fraction of windows smashed: 1/4
- Total windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) * (64 * 4) = (1/4) * 256 = 64

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars:
- Number of teachers' cars: 32
- Number of windows per car: 2
- Fraction of windows smashed: 3/4
- Total windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) * (32 * 2) = (3/4) * 64 = 48

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. This is done by adding the number of light blue, dark blue, light green, and dark green spools together.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

At 8:00, 5000 people lined up at a polling station. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. To find the number of people who voted by midday, we multiply 2/5 by 5000.

2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, we need to find the number of people remaining after midday. This is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by midday.
5000 - 2000 = 3000 people remained after midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. To find the number of people who voted by 16:00, we multiply 2/3 by the number of people remaining after midday.
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

Now, we need to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. This is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.

"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to add up the total number of animals and divide by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Total number of dogs = 8
Total number of cats = 5
Total number of birds = 3
Total number of horses = 12

Total number of animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mark buys 3 packs of old magic cards for $1800 each. The total cost is 3 packs * $1800 = $5400.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. Mark gets 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000. There are also 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each. The total value of these 30 cards is 30 * $50 = $1500. The total revenue is the sum of the value of all the cards: $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"Let's break down the costs for each amusement park. 

For the first amusement park, the cost for adults is 2 * $26 = $52, and the cost for children is 2 * $12 = $24. The total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

For the second amusement park, the cost for adults is 2 * $14 = $28, and the cost for children is 2 * $10 = $20. The total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

To find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks, we subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park: $76 - $48 = $28.

The final answer is: $28"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The tomato vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day and used to buy them for $0.5 each. He now buys them for $0.4 each. To find out how much he saves a day, we need to calculate the difference in cost.

Daily savings = (500 * 0.5) - (500 * 0.4)
Daily savings = 250 - 200
Daily savings = 50

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily savings by 7 to find the weekly savings.

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = 50 * 7
Weekly savings = 350

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Sean has 56 marbles.
- Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find Cal's marbles by doubling Sean's: 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.
- Now, we know Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so we multiply Sean's marbles by 4: 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: 224 (Carl) + 112 (Cal) = 336.

The final answer is: 336"
"To find out how many more groups are needed, we first need to determine the number of students per group. We have a total of 54 students and we want to divide them into 6 groups. 

Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

Now, we are told that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students, we multiply the number of groups by the students per group.

Total students = Number of groups * Students per group
Total students = 12 * 9
Total students = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find the number of additional students required to form 12 groups.

Additional students required = Total students required - Total students available
Additional students required = 108 - 54
Additional students required = 54

Since each group requires 9 students, we need to find the number of additional groups required.

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in a week. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekend days: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, we need to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, there are 8 weeks in two months. Multiply the total chairs rented in a week by 8:
500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

"Let's break down the sequence of events to find out how many bananas Gunther had at the end.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas, so the number of bananas left is 48 / 2 = 24.

Gunther added 25 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 24 + 25 = 49.

Arnold stole 12 bananas, so the number of bananas left is 49 - 12 = 37.

Gunther added 6 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 37 + 6 = 43.

The final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to first find out how much they will pay per month and then multiply it by 12.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, they will divide the bill equally among themselves. 

$100 / 4 = $25 per roommate per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12:

$25 * 12 = $300 per roommate per year.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party. To find the total number of glasses and plates, we need to multiply the number of dozen by 12.

Glasses: 8 dozen * 12 = 96 glasses
Plates: 4 dozen * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items:
- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

Glasses left: 96 - 10 = 86
Plates left: 48 - 6 = 42

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30 small stickers, we multiply 0.9 by 30, which equals 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. To find 50% of 40 large stickers, we multiply 0.5 by 40, which equals 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

Next, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers, 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons. To find the total number of buttons she has, we add these together: 3 + 20 + 27 + 20 = 70.

To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add the matches played on Monday, Friday, and Saturday.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday. 
He played 1 match on Friday. 
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches played on each day:

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the council has 33 members and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. 

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total number of shirts ordered, we need to calculate the number of students for each size and add them together.

First, we know that 11 students need size extra-small. Since twice as many students need size small as extra small, that's 2 * 11 = 22 students.

Next, we're told that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.

Then, half as many students need size large as size medium, which is 18 / 2 = 9 students.

Finally, six more students need size extra-large than large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 students.

Now, let's add the number of students for each size together: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win the big race. To find this number, we multiply 20% by 50.

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, the remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40.

60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. To find this number, we multiply 60% by 40.

60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. This is the remaining people after subtracting those who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win.

The number of people who think horse #12 will win is 40 - 24 = 16 people.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
2. One third of the Pomeranians are girls.
3. There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and we are given that this number is 6. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we found that there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for the three houses is 250. The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, and the third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles, and the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

Now, we need to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for. He has 25 ears of corn, so to find the price per ear, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection.

First, we need to find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we'll divide the total number of movies by 3:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:
200 * $6 = $1200

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

Now, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we'll multiply the remaining movies by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the scores of Ava and Emma. Ava receives 10 points for every enemy she jumps on, 5 points for each berry she collects, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when she finishes the level. Emma receives the same points for the same actions.

Let's assume Emma jumps on x enemies, collects y berries, and finishes the level in 60 seconds. 

Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies, collects y + 3 berries, and finishes the level in 60 - 4 seconds.

The score for Emma is 10x + 5y + 30(60) = 10x + 5y + 1800.

The score for Ava is 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(60 - 4) = 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 1740 = 10x + 5y + 1835.

The difference in their scores is (10x + 5y + 1835) - (10x + 5y + 1800) = 35.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known.

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. He then bought some more fish from the pet store, where a sales assistant dipped out 17 fish from a mixed tank.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O. After adding these fish to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

We can set up two equations based on this information. The first equation comes from the fact that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17: W + O = 17.

The second equation comes from the fact that Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We can solve the second equation for O: O = 2(4 + W) - 3 = 8 + 2W - 3 = 5 + 2W.

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the first equation: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combine like terms: 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

The distance between his home and office is 5 miles, and he travels this distance twice a day (to and from work), so the total daily distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost per week: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt. 

First, we need to find the total value of the quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter: 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, we need to find the total value of the twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply the number of twenties by the value of each twenty: 10 * $20 = $200.

However, Carrie only spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find the amount she spent, we multiply the total value of the twenties by 3/5: 3/5 * $200 = $120.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent to find the total amount of money she paid for lunch: $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Ricardo has 5 tomato plants, and each of them yields 22 tomatoes. To find the total number of tomatoes, we multiply the number of plants by the yield per plant: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes.

Next, Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants, and each of them yields 4 eggplants. To find the total number of eggplants, we multiply the number of plants by the yield per plant: 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the overall number of fruits: 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

The final answer is: 142"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that one-fourth of the TVs sold are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

"Hi there, I'm Victor. So, John is trying to raise money for a school trip, and the school has agreed to cover half of the cost. The trip costs $300. To figure out how much John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. 

Half of the trip cost is $300 / 2 = $150. The school will cover this amount. John already has $50. To find out how much John is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the amount the school will cover:

Amount John is missing = Amount school will cover - Amount John has
= $150 - $50
= $100

"To prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to find out how many logs Carson needs to burn. 

First, let's determine the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point. The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder, so it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

The temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. 

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to determine the number of groups and then the number of groups that brought back seashells.

First, we find the number of groups: 
Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we find the number of groups that brought back seashells:
Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells:
Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a train with 172 people on it. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Next, 13 people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

Finally, at the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

So, the number of people on the train is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's calculate how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month. 

Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day on his way home, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. To find the total amount of money he makes, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the value of each bottle cap and then multiply the result by the number of days in the month.

First, we multiply the number of bottle caps per day by the value of each bottle cap:
10 * $0.25 = $2.50 per day

Then, we multiply the daily amount by the number of days in the month:
$2.50 * 30 = $75

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
200 employees * $4000 = $800,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$800,000 * 3 = $2,400,000

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find Billy's hourly wage after his raises. He was initially paid $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Then, on his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Sally's hourly wage. Her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Next, we need to find their total earnings after working 20 hours. 

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more. 

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we can set up the equation: 

(14 + x) * 0.3 = 30

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:

"Let's break down Kris's gaming schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks, which is 14 days. So, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

Then, she plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week, which is 7 days. So, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two cars on the highway, with the first car traveling at 60 miles per hour and the second car passing it at 70 miles per hour. We want to find out how many miles will separate them after 2 hours.

First, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. The distance traveled is equal to the speed multiplied by the time. 

For the first car, the distance traveled is:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

For the second car, the distance traveled is:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

Now, we need to find the distance between the two cars. This is the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the distance between the two cars will be 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the ring, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the 30% premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Adding these together gives us $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we need to calculate the 30% premium. This is done by multiplying the total cost of the diamond and gold by 0.3, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold to get the final amount James paid: $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have the results of the standardized test for three different grades: third-graders, fourth-graders, and fifth-graders.

First, we know that 340 out of 500 third-graders passed the test. To find the pass rate for third-graders, we can divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(340 / 500) * 100 = 68%

Next, we're given that 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed the test. To find the pass rate for fourth-graders, we can divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(40 / 100) * 100 = 40%

Now, we're told that the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders. Since the pass rate of fourth-graders is 40%, the pass rate of fifth-graders is 2 * 40% = 80%. We also know that there are 400 fifth-graders, so the number of students who passed is 80% of 400:
(80/100) * 400 = 320

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(700 / 1000) * 100 = 70%

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. 

First, we need to find out how many chips Milo has in total. 

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with 144 chips. 

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it can be. We know that the area of a rectangle (such as the mosaic) is length * width. Since we know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), we can find the length.

Area = length * width
12 = length * 3
length = 12 / 3
length = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can find the total amount of tea drank in gallons by dividing 38 by 4, which equals 9.5 gallons. 

However, we are asked to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, which includes the tea left. The amount of tea left is 10 quarts. 

To find the total amount of tea at the beginning, we need to add the amount of tea drank to the amount of tea left. 

Total tea at the beginning = 38 (tea drank) + 10 (tea left) = 48 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies. He then sold 150 of them. To find out how many candies he has left, we need to subtract the number of candies sold from the initial number of candies. 

100 (initial candies) - 150 (candies sold) = -50 (candies left)

However, we can't have a negative number of candies, so this means Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold. 

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. Now, we need to find the total number of candies he has. 

100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 (total candies)

Since he sold 150 candies, we need to subtract this from the total number of candies to find out how many he still needs to sell. 

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 (candies left to sell)

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We start with 10 students at the beginning of the year. Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

Now, to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Rose starts by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each. This gives us a total of 3 * 5 = 15 petals.

Next, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each, adding 4 * 6 = 24 petals to the total.

Then, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each, contributing 5 * 4 = 20 petals to the total.

Finally, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each, adding 6 * 7 = 42 petals to the total.

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

However, Rose drops 1 petal from each set of flowers, so we need to subtract 4 petals from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals.

The final answer is: 97"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that John and DeSean bought a bag of marshmallows with 35 in it. They each made 9 S'mores, which means they used a total of 18 marshmallows. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Marshmallows used by John and DeSean = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Now, to find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 (since there are 2 kids).

Total marshmallows left = 14
Number of kids = 2
S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total time played by each person. Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each. 

The friend who is better than Jack plays for 1.5 times the time, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.

The total time played is 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

The total amount of money used is 840 * 0.05 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down John's purchases at the market. He bought 3 goats for $500 each, so the total cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500. 

Next, he bought 2 cows for $1500 each, so the total cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

To find the total amount John spent, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Then, he gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

So, Joe gives away a total of 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

"Let's break down the problem. The charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 came from organizations. To find out how much the students raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations from the total.

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

This is the total amount raised by the students. Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the total amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total number of cars 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 of the cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

To find the number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were present when he got out of class for the lunch break, which is 35.

"Let's break down John's daily earnings. He does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. Each task pays $1.20. 

To find out his daily earnings, we multiply the number of cycles by the number of tasks per cycle and the pay per task.

Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Now, let's calculate his weekly earnings. Since he works a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7.

Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

"Let's break down the information given. Sasha had the home court advantage in the first game and scored 14 points. In the same game, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, which means Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

Now, let's consider the second game. Sasha struggles during away games, and this time, she played at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's break down the information given about the Easter eggs Cindy collected. We know she had 5 green eggs. Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, that means she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

Next, we're told she had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. So, she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. To find the number of yellow eggs, we divide the number of pink eggs by 3: 9 / 3 = 3.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

"Let's break down Boris's chocolate production for the first three weeks. 

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate. 
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's break down the time Britany spends on TikTok-related activities per week:

- She spends 2 hours writing amateur songs, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes on makeup, 6 days a week, which is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.
- She records 18 videos, each lasting 4 minutes, so that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time she spends on these activities: 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours.

"Let's break down the installation costs for Angela. The interior design firm offers a base installation package for $129.00, which includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.

Angela needs to have 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed. Since the base package already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items.

For the mirrors, Angela needs 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors, which will cost 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.
For the chandeliers, Angela needs 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier, which will cost 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.
For the pictures, Angela needs 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures, which will cost 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

To find the total cost, we add the base installation package to the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, we know that Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take a total of 18 hours to cross the highway. To find out how long it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway, we need to divide the total time by the number of kangaroos. 

So, one kangaroo would take 18 / 3 = 6 hours to travel across the highway.

Now, we're told that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means they will take twice as long to travel across the highway. Since there are four turtles, we need to multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2 and then by 4.

So, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is 6 * 2 * 4 = 48 hours.

"Let's break down Erika's situation. She's saving for a new laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price of the new one will be reduced by $200, making it $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has received some money from her part-time job, which is $150, and her mom has given her $80 to help out. So, the total amount of money she has received is $150 + $80 = $230.

Since Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount of money she has is the price of the laptop after trading in her old one plus the extra money she needs, which is $400 + $50 = $450.

To find out how much money Erika had in her purse initially, we subtract the money she received from the total amount she has now: $450 - $230 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam wants to eat some sliced apples. He decides to slice 3 large apples and 5 small apples.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so 3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.
A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

To find the total number of apple slices, we add the slices from the large and small apples together: 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day with the current milk production rate.

The current milk production rate is 5 liters per cow per day. To find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can divide 25 by 5.

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to have 5 cows in total.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. 
1/6 * 12 = 2 millimeters

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. 
2/3 * 12 = 8 millimeters

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. 
1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions together: 
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. To find out how much money he needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Total cost of items: $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080

Now, let's see how much money Gabriel has. He has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help him. So, the total amount of money he has is:
$5000 (from working) + $200 (from brother) = $5200

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items:
$10080 - $5200 = $4880

So, Gabriel still needs $4880."
"To find the change, we need to subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount Thea gave the craftsman.

"Let's break down Craig's expenses. He has 2 twenty dollar bills, which is a total of $40.

Craig buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack collected by dividing the number of dishes by 2. Jack collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes together is 180."
"Let's break down the information given: there are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. 5 of them are good at math only, and 8 of them perform well in English only. The rest are good at both math and English.

To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English. The students good at both math and English are counted in both the math only and English only groups, so we need to add them to the students good at math only to get the total number of students good at math.

First, let's find the number of students good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total, and 5 are good at math only and 8 are good at English only, the number of students good at both math and English is 20 - (5 + 8) = 7.

Now, we can find the total number of students good at math by adding the students good at math only and those good at both math and English: 5 + 7 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"Hey there, I'm Victor. So, Vicki is planning a pop concert at her high school, and she's got a tight schedule to keep. The show is going to be 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Each group gets 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, adding up to a total of 10 minutes per group.

Now, let's subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time. That leaves us with 120 - 10 = 110 minutes for performances.

To find out how many groups can perform, we need to divide the total performance time by the time each group takes: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, Vicki can fit 11 groups into her concert schedule.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

After 1 year, Brenda will have: $300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525
After 2 years, Brenda will have: $525 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $750
After 3 years, Brenda will have: $750 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $975

The final answer is: $975"
"Let's break down the information given. We have 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, which means 20 of them do. To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts: 40 - 20 = 20.

Now, let's look at the floral shirts. We know 20 of them have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.

The question asks for the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. We already know that there are 20 white shirts with no collars and 30 floral shirts with no buttons. The difference between these two numbers is 30 - 20 = 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many goats were sold from Farm Y. Since Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, and he sold 10 goats from Farm X, we can calculate the number of goats sold from Farm Y by multiplying the number of goats sold from Farm X by 2. 
Number of goats sold from Farm Y = 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we know that Mr. Smith sold 20 goats from Farm Y. To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm Y.
Number of goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of goats left in Farm X. We know that Mr. Smith initially had 55 goats in Farm X and he sold 10 goats. To find the number of goats left in Farm X, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm X.
Number of goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45

Finally, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y.
Total number of goats left = 45 + 25 = 70

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two types of baskets: green food costing $25 each and red food costing $18 each. We're buying 3 baskets of each type.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food: 3 * $25 = $75. Then, we calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food: 3 * $18 = $54.

Now, we add the costs of both types of baskets to get the total cost before the discount: $75 + $54 = $129. However, we also get a discount of $2 for each basket of red food. Since we bought 3 baskets of red food, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

To find the final cost, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount: $129 - $6 = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to determine the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of that would be 45 rooms.

45 rooms need to be cleaned, and it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. To find the total time, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

Now, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60.

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have the following information:

- I am three years younger than my brother, so my age is x and my brother's age is x + 3.
- I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.
- My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1.
- The sum of our ages is 87.

We can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x + 8 - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 8x + 17 = 87.

Subtract 17 from both sides: 8x = 70.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.75.

However, age cannot be a decimal. Let's try to find a whole number solution.

Since x must be a whole number, we can try x = 8 or x = 9.

If x = 8, then my brother's age is 8 + 3 = 11, my sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6, and my mom's age is 3(11) - 1 = 32.

The sum of our ages is 8 + 11 + 6 + 32 = 57, which is less than 87.

If x = 9, then my brother's age is 9 + 3 = 12, my sister's age is 9 - 2 = 7, and my mom's age is 3(12) - 1 = 35.

The sum of our ages is 9 + 12 + 7 + 35 = 63, which is still less than 87.

If x = 10, then my brother's age is 10 + 3 = 13, my sister's age is 10 - 2 = 8, and my mom's age is 3(13) - 1 = 38.

The sum of our ages is 10 + 13 + 8 + 38 = 69, which is still less than 87.

If x = 11, then my brother's age is 11 + 3 = 14, my sister's age is 11 - 2 = 9, and my mom's age is 3(14) - 1 = 41.

The sum of our ages is 11 + 14 + 9 + 41 = 75, which is still less than 87.

If x = 12, then my brother's age is 12 + 3 = 15, my sister's age is 12 - 2 = 10, and my mom's age is 3(15) - 1 = 44.

The sum of our ages is 12 + 15 + 10 + 44 = 81, which is still less than 87.

If x = 13, then my brother's age is 13 + 3 = 16, my sister's age is 13 - 2 = 11, and my mom's age is 3(16) - 1 = 47.

The sum of our ages is 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.

Therefore, the correct answer is 13."

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, which means it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. To find the new amount of water, we add this increase to the amount from the second day: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Now, to find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to add the amounts from all three days: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"

Day 1: 
- Initially, there are 10 people infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new people are infected.
- Total people infected after Day 1: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2: 
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total people infected after Day 2: 70 (previous) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 490.

Day 3: 
- The 360 people infected on Day 2 infect 360 * 6 = 2160 new people.
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total people infected after Day 3: 490 (previous) + 2160 (new) + 360 (new) + 60 (new) = 3070.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves every hour. Since she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, that's a total of 5 hours. 

In 5 hours, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked a total of 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. To find the total amount raised in dollars, we need to convert the price per slice to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can divide 50 cents by 100 to get the price per slice in dollars: 50 / 100 = 0.5 dollars per slice.

Now, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

However, this is not the final answer. We need to consider that the problem states she sold all the slices. Since she baked 10 loaves, and each loaf has 8 slices, she actually baked 10 * 8 = 80 slices. But the question states she sold all the slices, which is also 80 slices. So, the correct calculation is 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can find the number of silver coins by subtracting 30 from the number of gold coins.

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
Number of silver coins = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins.

Total coins = Number of silver coins + Number of gold coins
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

The total number of burritos eaten is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos in total, the number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have three variables: the number of books Sofie has (S), the number of books Anne has (A), and the number of books Fawn has (F). We know that together, they have 85 books, so S + A + F = 85.

We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, which can be expressed as S = A + 25. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, which can be expressed as A = F - 12.

Now, let's substitute the expression for S into the first equation: (A + 25) + A + F = 85. Combining like terms, we get 2A + F + 25 = 85.

Next, let's substitute the expression for A into this equation: 2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85. Simplifying this, we get 2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85.

Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84.

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28.

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to first find the cost of 1 bottle of soda and 1 bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

Next, Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we can multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing by 4. So, 80 / 4 = 20.

Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total marbles he had after receiving the gift: 80 - 20 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 questions, and Amy correctly answers 80% of them. So, she gets 10 * 0.8 = 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. There are 20 questions, and Amy correctly answers 90% of them. So, she gets 20 * 0.9 = 18 points from the true/false questions.

Now, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. There are 5 questions, and Amy correctly answers 60% of them. Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so she gets 5 * 0.6 * 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

To find Amy's total score, we add the points from each type of question together: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41.

The final answer is: 41"
"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens is:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000, so the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, the amount he needs to make from selling the chickens to make a profit of $2000 is $9000. 

However, we are asked for the cost price of the chickens. To find the cost price, we need to subtract the profit from the selling price. 

The selling price is $9000 and the profit is $2000. 

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses.

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

The final answer is: $\boxed{-2}$"
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the manicure. It's 1/4 of the cost of the hair service, which is $400. So, 1/4 * $400 = $100.

Next, we need to find the cost of the pedicure. It's 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is $100. So, 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sarah has a rope that's 20 meters long, and she plans to sell it to her friend for $2 per meter. To find out how much money she'll get from selling the rope, we multiply the length of the rope by the price per meter:

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's consider the new rope she wants to buy. It costs $1.5 per meter, and she wants to buy a rope that's also 20 meters long. To find out how much she'll spend on the new rope, we multiply the length of the new rope by the price per meter:

20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, let's calculate how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope. We subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount of money she got from selling the old rope:

$40 - $30 = $10

The final answer is: $10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out when her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call the number of years it takes for her age to be thrice her present age 'x'. At that time, her age will be 8 + x, and it will be thrice her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

So, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 24.

Solving for x, we get x = 24 - 8 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, each packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the chicken: 6 packets of chicken * $4 = $24.

Next, we need to find the cost of the apples. Since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, and each pack of strawberries costs $4, each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the apples: 7 packs of apples * $2 = $14.

The total cost of the bacon is $10, the total cost of the chicken is $24, the total cost of the strawberries is $12, and the total cost of the apples is $14. 

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it includes a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as x minutes. The final concert's runtime is 2x minutes, and adding the 15-minute encore gives us 2x + 15 minutes.

Since the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the situation. Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"Let's break down the problem. The singer has 50 microphones and wants to arrange them in pairs. However, 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs.

To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we need to find 80% of the total number of microphones, since 20% won't be arranged. 

80% of 50 is calculated as 0.8 * 50 = 40. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we need to divide 40 by 2 to find the number of pairs.

40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the information given. Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes. Then, he sees 2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead. To find 2/3 of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and then divide by 3: (6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4. 

Next, Jerry observes 3 groups of eight birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds in these groups, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group: 3 * 8 = 24.

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group: 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Lani baked a total of 55 cookies. She ate 5 of them, so we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many cookies are left.

55 (total cookies) - 5 (cookies eaten) = 50 cookies left

Now, we know Lani placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars.

50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar

So, there are 10 cookies in each jar."
"Let's break down the problem. We have 5 orchids with 5 petals each and 4 African daisies with 10 petals each. 

First, we calculate the total number of petals on the orchids: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, we calculate the total number of petals on the daisies: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we need to determine the number of flowering plants first.

One-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants: 100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants.

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants: 75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants: 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first determine the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"Let's break down Ellen's daily expenses. She buys two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $3. 

To find the cost of one carrot, we need to set up an equation. Let's represent the cost of one carrot as 'x'. The total cost of two carrots is 2x. The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11.

The equation is: 2x + 6 (salad) + 3 (yogurt) = 11

Combine the constants: 2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1

The cost of one carrot is $1."
"Let's break down Mark's new weekly earnings. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. To find out his total hours worked in a week, we multiply the hours he works in a day by the number of days he works in a week: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Mark's pay was raised by $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour. Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x (for Joe's lawn) + 18x (for Kamala's lawn) + 30x (for Alba's lawn) = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

To find y, we need to find the value of x. Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y. 
54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

"Let's break down John's car rental business. He rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour. To find out how much he earns from renting his car, we need to multiply the number of times he rents it by the number of hours and his hourly rate.

Number of times rented: 10
Number of hours per rental: 3
Hourly rate: $25

Total earnings = Number of times rented * Number of hours per rental * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, we need to subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha.
2. Martha bought 5 more notebooks, and now she has a total of 7 notebooks.

From point 2, we can find out how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since she bought 5 more and now has 7, she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha had 2 notebooks initially, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

To find out how many cookies are left, we subtract the cookies her husband took from the total number of cookies. 

100 (initial cookies) - 4 (cookies taken by her husband) = 96 cookies left

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Let's break down the information given. Denise read 10 pages yesterday, and Daniel read 13 pages yesterday. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, we can calculate Denise's total pages read today as 5 + 13 = 18.

Denise's total pages read = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.
Daniel's total pages read = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 28 - 13 = 15.

Since 4 adult bowls is equivalent to 4 child bowls, 4 child bowls will also be used. This leaves 4 child bowls of soup remaining.

Each child will eat one bowl for dinner, so there are 4 child bowls left for lunch. To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to divide the remaining child bowls by the number of children.

4 child bowls / 2 children = 2

So, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To determine how much material Jo needs to make face masks for her class, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, we know that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks. To find out how much material is needed for one small mask, we divide the total material by the number of masks: 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per mask. Now, we multiply this by the number of small masks Jo wants to make: 20 small masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards.

For large masks, we know that 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks. To find out how much material is needed for one large mask, we divide the total material by the number of masks: 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per mask. Now, we multiply this by the number of large masks Jo wants to make: 8 large masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards.

To find the total material needed, we add the material required for small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

To find out how many red shoeboxes Tim used, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9. 

1/3 of 9 = 9 / 3 = 3

So, Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes to go fishing.

Initially, Tim had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. After using 3 blue and 3 red shoeboxes, he is left with:

Blue shoeboxes: 7 - 3 = 4

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. There are 20 red balloons, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

We also know that the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58. Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3 times the number of yellow balloons.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. The total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3y. We can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

To solve for y, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 18.

Then, we divide both sides by 3: y = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream. The cake costs $11, and 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the number of 2-balloon sets is 12 / 2 = 6. So, the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

So, there are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, and then add them together.

The number of students playing tennis is 6. 
The number of students playing volleyball is twice the number playing tennis, so it's 6 * 2 = 12.
The number of students playing soccer is 16 boys + 22 girls = 38.

Now, let's add the number of students playing each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each, and there are 30 students. So, the total revenue is 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.8/lollipop = 300 * $0.8 = $240.

Next, we need to find the total cost. The lollipops cost $0.5 each, and each student bought 10 lollipops. So, the total cost is 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.5/lollipop = 300 * $0.5 = $150.

Now, we can find the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $240 - $150 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Hi there, I'm Victor. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many pets Larry has.

To start, Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Then, he has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"Let's break down the problem. Abby eats 2 slices of bread per day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which means Josh eats 4 slices per day. 

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices of bread per day.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day: 24 / 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. 

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old, and by her 10th birthday, she has been collecting for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months to get the total number of months.

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows. To find out how many cups are in each row, we divide 27 by 3.

27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 / 2.

However, we can't have half a cup of tea, so we need to consider the whole number options. If there are 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. 

If there are 5 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15.

Since the total number of mint tea cups is 15, the correct answer is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to first determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, and there are 10000 gallons of water in the pool, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Next, we need to find the total amount of water used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the total amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"Let's break down Colby's expenses for the month. He's already spent money on 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays ($10 each) and 8 movies on other days ($7 each), 2 tubs of popcorn ($8 each), and 4 boxes of candy ($2 each).

Expenses for movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
Expenses for movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
Expenses for popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
Expenses for candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total expenses: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby's monthly budget is $150, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can spend $10 on a ticket. This leaves him with $20 - $10 = $10.

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

In total, Colby can see 1 movie on a Friday and 1 movie on another day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 
Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories. 
Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from both types of pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 378 / 5 = 75.6"
"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so it traveled 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so it traveled 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to determine how many toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls. We know she had a bag of building blocks with 31 blocks, a bin of stuffed animals with 8 stuffed animals, and a tower of stacking rings with 9 multicolored rings.

Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls = Number of blocks + Number of stuffed animals + Number of rings
= 31 + 8 + 9
= 48

Since Sophie's total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls is 62, we can find the number of bouncy balls by subtracting the total number of toys before buying bouncy balls from the total number of toys after buying bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after buying bouncy balls - Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls
= 62 - 48
= 14

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J.

From the given information, we can form the following equations:

1. P + Pp + J = 100
2. Pp = J + 10
3. P = Pp + J

We can substitute Pp from equation 2 into equation 1:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P from equation 3 into the above equation:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 20 + 10
Pp = 30

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the situation. Maria invited 4 friends over for a water balloon fight. At the start, she gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. So, her friends have a total of 4 * 2 = 8 balloons. Maria also has 1 balloon for herself. 

In total, they have 8 (friends' balloons) + 1 (Maria's balloon) = 9 balloons initially.

Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many boxes of stuff the charity group has in total. They have 10 people donating 5 boxes each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. They also already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Now, we need to figure out how many tables they need to display all these boxes. Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we divide the total number of boxes by 2. That's 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

The charity group already owns 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

"Let's calculate the average total distance spat in the watermelon seed spitting contest between Zoey and Sydney.

Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, her total distance is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, her total distance is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the total number of seeds: 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

The final answer is: 10.93"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000.

First, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and it runs 24 hours a day for 30 days. So, the total number of widgets it can produce is:

60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, and it also runs 24 hours a day for 30 days. So, the total number of widgets it can produce is:

45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day
1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in revenue:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"Let's break down Cameron's hotel stay. He arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay, and 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. However, Cameron can also choose to pay 1000 pesos for the initial 12 hours and an additional 70 pesos for every hour after that.

Since Cameron stays for 17 hours, he needs to pay for 5 additional hours after the initial 12 hours. The cost for these additional hours would be 70 * 5 = 350 pesos.

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the 24-hour option, which is 1600 pesos. To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the 12-hour option with additional hours instead of the 24-hour option.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"Let's break down John's situation. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked for 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars. After spending 50 dollars on gas, he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

John also wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, which means he'll have 250 - 100 = 150 dollars remaining.

Now, let's consider the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars, and John wants to buy 5 of them. The total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. After buying the pencils, John will have 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

With the remaining 100 dollars, John can buy 25-dollar pens. To find out how many pens he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of each pen: 100 / 25 = 4.

So, John can buy 4 pens with the money he has left."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much James spent on the CDs. Since each CD costs $15 and he bought 10 of them, the original price is 10 * $15 = $150.

However, James got a 40% discount on the CDs. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 0.4: 0.4 * $150 = $60. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the price after the discount: $150 - $60 = $90.

Next, James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, making a total of 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the price after the discount from the amount he made from selling the CDs: $200 - $90 = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"Let's break down the earnings from Jen's root crops. She has 6 yams that can be sold at $1.5 each, so the total earnings from yams are 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, she has 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each, so the total earnings from sweet potatoes are 10 * $2 = $20.

Lastly, she has 4 carrots that cost $1.25 each, so the total earnings from carrots are 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

"Let's break down James' journey across the lake. First, we need to find the time it took him to swim 60% of the 20-mile lake. To do this, we'll calculate 60% of 20 miles.

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, so we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

After losing 7 stickers, Jasmine has 8 stickers left. Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. To find the total number of stickers she has now, we add the stickers she received to the ones she already had.

8 (remaining stickers) + 5 (additional stickers) = 13

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much commission Cayley will earn from selling newspapers.

First, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times. The number of copies sold is 6, the price per copy is $5, and the commission rate is 10%. 

Commission from New York Times = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
Commission from New York Times = 300 / 100
Commission from New York Times = $3

Next, we need to calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal. The number of copies sold is 10, the price per copy is $15, and the commission rate is 8%.

Commission from Wall Street Journal = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
Commission from Wall Street Journal = 1200 / 100
Commission from Wall Street Journal = $12

Now, we add the commission from both newspapers to find the total commission.

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. 

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We can express Bahati's score in terms of Azibo's score as B = A + 20. 

We can also express Bahati's score in terms of Dinar's score as B = D + 10. 

Since both expressions represent Bahati's score, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We can simplify this equation to A = D - 10. 

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so we can write the equation A + B + D = 45. 

We can substitute B = A + 20 into the equation A + B + D = 45 to get A + (A + 20) + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 2A + D + 20 = 45. 

We can also substitute B = D + 10 into the equation A + B + D = 45 to get A + (D + 10) + D = 45. 

This simplifies to A + 2D + 10 = 45. 

Now we have two equations: 2A + D + 20 = 45 and A + 2D + 10 = 45. 

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate A: (2A + D + 20) - (A + 2D + 10) = 45 - 45. 

This simplifies to A - D + 10 = 0. 

We can rearrange the equation to get A - D = -10. 

Now we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation A + 2D + 10 = 45 to get (D - 10) + 2D + 10 = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = 15 - 10. 

This simplifies to A = 5. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is doubled. There are 100 pages to the inch, so the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

The book is 1.5 inches thick, so the total number of pages in the book is 200 * 1.5 = 300 pages.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked:
11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:
15 * 60 = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 / 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 * 60 = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can find the number of spoons by multiplying the number of cups by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 spoons.

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of cups and the number of spoons.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to determine the initial number of occupied beds. Since 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we can calculate this as follows:

1/5 of 1000 = 200

This means that 200 beds are occupied initially. Since 4/5 of the beds are unoccupied, we can calculate this as follows:

4/5 of 1000 = 800

Now, we need to calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to multiply 50 by 14 (number of days in 2 weeks).

50 * 14 = 700

Now, we add the number of occupied beds initially to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

200 + 700 = 900

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

1000 - 900 = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work-related. To find out how many emails are not work-related, we subtract the work emails from the total: 16 - 7 = 9.

Now, we know that two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family. To find two-thirds of 9, we multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3: (2/3) * 9 = (2 * 9) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. So, 6 emails are to her family.

The remaining non-work emails (not to family) are 9 - 6 = 3. Now, we need to find out how many of these emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

From point 3, we know Aliya's age is 3 years. 
From point 2, we know Shawna's age is three times Aliya's age, so Shawna's age is 3 * 3 = 9 years.

From point 1, we know Shawna's father's age is five times Shawna's age, so Shawna's father's age is 5 * 9 = 45 years.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from the number reported by Courtney.

Let's assume the number reported by Courtney is 100%. 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, we need to find the total number of balls carried by the three boys. We can do this by adding the number of balls each of them carried: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7.

However, we also know that the total number of balls is equal to the sum of the balls carried by each of them, which is represented by the variable x. Since Jason carried 2x balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x.

2x = 2
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls by substituting x into the equation 7x.

Total number of balls = 7x
Total number of balls = 7 * 1
Total number of balls = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day. On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. Amora and Lainey got an equal amount of corn chips, and Collins got 15 more than the others. We know that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips.

Since Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add the number of corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got. We can do this by adding the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got, and then adding the number of corn chips that Collins got.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = 70 + 70 + 85
Total = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three variables: the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe (A), Stan (S), and Alex (L). We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation A + S + L = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so we can write the equation L = S + 5.

Additionally, we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write the equation S = 4A - 13.

Now, let's substitute the second equation into the first one: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
This simplifies to A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Next, we can substitute the third equation into the previous one: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
This simplifies to A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.

Now, let's combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Next, we can add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Now, we can divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's break down the information given: each episode of the show is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode.

Since there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, the number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

The bird flies in a southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this direction is 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Then, the bird turns direction and flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this direction is 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Finally, the bird changes direction and flies toward the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this direction is 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Since the bird traveled 36 miles north, we need to subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to find the net distance between the two homes.

Net distance = Distance traveled in the first 10 hours + Distance traveled in the last 5 hours - Distance traveled in the 2 hours
Net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"Let's break down the brownie situation for Greta. She started with a batch of 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies. Then, she received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. Her friends added to the celebration by bringing 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we add these amounts together: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

However, not all of these brownies made it to the end of the day. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten during the party, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

To find Nani's sister's age, we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age. Since 25% is the same as 0.25, we multiply Nani's age by 0.25 to find the age difference. The age difference is 8 * 0.25 = 2 years. To find Nani's sister's age, we subtract the age difference from Nani's age: 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now that we have the ages of all three family members, we can find the total age by adding their ages together: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"

The remaining two phones are half price, so each costs $600 / 2 = $300. The total cost for the remaining two phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

To find the total cost for all four phones, we add the cost of the first two phones to the cost of the remaining two phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Carlton's team has 13 players. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can find the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

13 + 7 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of players in both teams. To do this, we add the number of players in Carlton's team to the number of players in Zeke's team.

13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges at the market. Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She then gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, let's find out how many oranges she has left. She had 240 oranges initially and gave away 80, so she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can find the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. To find out how many cherries Richard has, we subtract 10 from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract 50 from 60: 60 - 50 = 10.

Since Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which means he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Since he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday, and he sold 15 boxes on Sunday, he must have sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use. 

She reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce. So, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Since each bottle of sunscreen is 8 ounces, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces) to find out how many bottles she will need.

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

The price of the blue car is $100. To find 40% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.4. This gives us $40.

Now, we subtract the discount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car: $100 - $40 = $60.

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The total cost of both cars is the sum of their prices: $100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil will be 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

From point 2, we know that when Emil turns 24, his dad will be twice as old as Emil. So, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Now, we need to find the current age of Emil's dad and brother. Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old (since Emil is 19 now and will turn 24 in 5 years). Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the width of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract 18 inches from the total length of the flower bed for each plant. However, we also need to subtract the width of the plant itself (12 inches) from the remaining length. 

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 18n - 12n = 1320 - 30n.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Artemis and her father have a 30-pound bag of soil. They plan to use it to plant roses, carnations, and sunflowers.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, each carnation needs 1.5 pounds, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds. They plan to plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations. For the sunflowers, that's 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. For the carnations, that's 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Adding those together, we get 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Now, let's subtract that from the total amount of soil they have: 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

"Let's break down Jessica's situation. She makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. To find out how much she saves each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she saves $500.00 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year to find the total savings in a year: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we need to divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Now, let's look at the cooking time. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30.

90 / 30 = 3, so it will take her 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Next, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the second time, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet and then use that information to determine Bill's age at the time of the second sighting.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 

Three times the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is 3 * 30 = 90 years old. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. 

So, Bill's dad was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when Bill was born. 

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, Bill was 30 - 15 = 15 years old when his dad was born.

Now, let's find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. We know that 75 years passed between the two sightings, and Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet. 

If we subtract 75 years from the age of Bill's dad at the second sighting, we get 90 - 75 = 15 years old. This is the age of Bill's dad when Bill was born. 

Since Bill was 15 years old when his dad was born, we need to add 15 years to find Bill's age at the time of the first sighting. 

15 + 15 = 30 years old.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down Buford's check-writing habits. He writes a check every month for his electric bill, which amounts to 12 checks per year. He also writes a check every month for his gas bill, adding another 12 checks per year. Additionally, he writes two checks to the church every month, resulting in 24 checks per year. Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service every quarter, which translates to 4 checks per year.

To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to add these numbers together: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break down the information given. We have two planes flying multiple times a day. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights and splits the remaining flights equally between France and Germany. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"The three little wolves, Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous, are quite the vocal bunch. Let's break down their howling habits. Tobias lets out a 20-second howl each time. Chikote, being the more enthusiastic one, howls for twice as long as Tobias, which means Chikote's howls last 40 seconds.

Now, Igneous is the longest of the three, howling for as long as the other two combined. That's 20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) = 60 seconds for Igneous.

Adding up the individual howling times, we get 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60, since there are 60 seconds in a minute. So, 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam bought some new trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6 for this purpose, and his father gave him twice as much as his mother.

First, we need to find out how much his father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, we multiply the amount his mother gave him by 2. So, his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money Adam received from his parents. We add the amount his mother gave him to the amount his father gave him: $6 + $12 = $18.

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have four children: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.

First, let's find the total age of Akbar and Alessandro. 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age = 3 + 4 = 7

Since the total age of the children is 20, we can express the equation as:
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20

We are also given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4)

We can simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
7 + (7 + W) + W = 20
14 + 2W = 20
2W = 6
W = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Walter starts by collecting $500 from his neighbors. Then, he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. 

The total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

However, Walter's lawyer will only consider the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, not the $200 donated by his friend. Therefore, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 is still $2000.

To find out how much the lawyer will contribute, we multiply $2000 by 3.

$2000 * 3 = $6000

The final answer is: $6000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

Next, the bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we multiply the total number of cookies by 1/2. 

Cookies given to the church = 1500 * 1/2
= 750

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a family of 6, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids. They need to divide a watermelon in such a way that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

To simplify the problem, let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. If each kid gets x units, then each adult gets 2x units, since they get twice as much as each kid.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each). The total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combine like terms: 6x = 100.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

So, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 33.33"
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes
Convert total time from minutes to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Jordan needs 3 hours to make the cake. To be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm, she should start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

"Let's break down the problem. Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars door to door. Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, and Peter sold four and a half boxes. They sold 64 chocolate bars together.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total earnings per month are $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the problem. We know Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each. We also know that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars.

To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 48 = 98

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of female students at Brook Hills High School.

First, we know that the school has a total of 3000 students. Half of these students are over 16 years old, which means there are 1500 students over 16. 

Now, let's find the number of male students over 16. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 are male, we can calculate this as 1500 / 4 = 375.

To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Next, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16, which is also 1500 students. Since one-half of the students under 16 are male, we can calculate this as 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we can find the total number of female students by adding the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps. 

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Maria's power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours, and then it loses 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. We're also given that the final charge remaining is 28%.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

For the next 3 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%. However, we know that the final charge remaining is 28%, so the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

Since the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 6%, we can set up the equation: 34% - 28% = 6%. This equation is true, so we can move on to the next step.

Now, we need to find the initial charge, x. We know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%, and the charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 34% = 21%. So, we can set up the equation: x - 21% = 55%.

Solving for x, we get x = 76%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 76%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{76}$"
"Let's break down Janet's situation. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, making her total hourly earnings $25. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for the down payment. To find 20% of $10,000, we multiply $10,000 by 0.2, which equals $2000.

Now, we need to determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruits. He's already bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, 4 pears at $0.5 each, 2 kiwis at $1 each, and 5 apples at $0.75 each.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Now, let's find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining money. Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, each friend received 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are in 1.3 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, 1 pack has 60 pieces. 

1.3 packs = 1 pack + 0.3 packs. 
1 pack has 60 pieces, so 0.3 packs have 0.3 * 60 = 18 pieces.

So, each friend received 60 + 18 = 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"Let's break down the information given. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. 

Since she put the same number of pictures into each album, we can find the number of pictures in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, let's consider the types of albums. 3 albums were selfies only, and 2 albums were portraits. The remaining albums are not specified, but we can find the number of remaining albums by subtracting the number of selfies and portrait albums from the total number of albums.

8 albums - 3 selfies albums - 2 portrait albums = 3 remaining albums

Since the remaining albums are not specified, we can assume they are either another type of album or a mix of the remaining types. However, we are only asked for the number of portraits and selfies. 

The number of selfies is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

The number of portraits is 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits.

However, we also need to consider the 3 remaining albums. If these albums are also portraits, then the total number of portraits would be 18 + 3 * 9 = 45 portraits. But if they are selfies, then the total number of selfies would be 27 + 3 * 9 = 54 selfies.

Since we are only asked for the number of portraits and selfies, we can provide two possible answers based on the assumption of the remaining albums.

Option 1: If the remaining albums are portraits, then the total number of portraits and selfies is 18 + 27 = 45.
Option 2: If the remaining albums are selfies, then the total number of portraits and selfies is 27 + 27 = 54.

The final answer is: 
Option 1: 45

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Since x = 2y, we can substitute this into the equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to first determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2 and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2. 

Since the ratios are the same, the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches will be proportional to the price of the second package. 

The price of the second package is $6 for 4 sandwiches. To find the price per sandwich, we divide the price by the number of sandwiches: 6/4 = 1.5. 

Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: 1.5 * 8 = 12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month for the bedroom set, we need to calculate the remaining balance after he sells his old bedroom set and then determine the monthly interest.

First, let's find out how much Tom still owes after selling his old bedroom set:

Total cost of bedroom set: $3000
Amount paid from selling old bedroom set: $1000
Amount still owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to find out how much Tom has to pay per month. The interest rate is 10% per month, so we need to calculate 10% of the amount still owed:

Amount still owed: $2000
Interest rate: 10% = 0.10
Monthly payment: $2000 * 0.10 = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"Let's break down the situation step by step.

Sally initially had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst due to the gust of wind. To find the number of red balloons that burst, we multiply 25 by 0.4, which equals 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 15 red balloons.

Next, the loud sound startled Sally, causing her to release half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 6 yellow balloons.

As Sally approached the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree. She added 75% of these blue balloons to her remaining clutch. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.75, which equals 6. So, Sally added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's add up the total number of balloons Sally has: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. The total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

The probability of not having to turn in his homework is 102% - 100% = 2%. However, this is not possible since the probability cannot be greater than 100%. To find the correct probability, we need to subtract the probability of the three scenarios from 100%: 100% - 50% - 40% - 12% = -2%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to subtract the number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question asks for the number of tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, implying that the remaining tickets are for guests.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we need to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. We're told that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we can set up a proportion.

Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Then, 3x = 150 (since 3 small beans = 1 medium-sized bean). 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Total earnings: 3 days * $15 per day = $45
Total expenses: 3 days * $3 per day = $9

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Next, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total: 
Total hours = 6 hours per day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses:
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the books. Since Ted bought 3 books for 16 dollars each, we multiply the number of books by the cost per book: 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pencils. Ted bought 3 pencils for 6 dollars each, so we multiply the number of pencils by the cost per pencil: 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

The final answer is: $66"
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to determine the total number of soda bottles and then multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem. Uncle Franky has two boxes of apples, and each box contains 40 apples. To find the total number of apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box: 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Now, we need to determine how many packs Uncle Franky can make with 80 apples. Each pack contains 8 apples. To find the number of packs, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack: 80 / 8 = 10.

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left after buying cheese, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so after buying the cheese, she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left.

"Let's break down Jim's situation. He takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, which totals $200,000 in loans. Additionally, he loses $25,000 per year for 4 years due to not working while in college, totaling $100,000.

The total amount Jim needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples to $75,000 per year. To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width, so the area of one piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day.

First, we need to calculate the amount lost in each race. 

1. In the first race, he lost $5.
2. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.
3. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.
4. Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.
5. The number of races is 3.

"To find the total population of South America, we need to calculate the total number of people living in all the cities. 

There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities. So, the total number of cities is 26 * 5 = 130.

Since each city has 1000 people, the total population of South America is 130 * 1000 = 130,000.

The final answer is: 130000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first calculate their current heights.

Xavier's height: 4 feet = 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches) + 3 inches = 51 inches
Cole's height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height
Difference = 52 inches - 51 inches
Difference = 1 inch

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three people who divided an amount of $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first, and the third person took twice what the second took.

Let's denote the share of the first person as x. The second person's share would then be x + 80, and the third person's share would be 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combining like terms, we get: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Simplifying further, we get: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtracting 240 from both sides, we get: 4x = 1680.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 420.

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car is $20,000, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * depreciation rate)
= $12,472 - ($12,472 * 0.21)
= $12,472 - $2,620.32
= $9,851.68

The final answer is: $9851.68"
"To find the number of Spanish books in the library, we first need to determine the number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so the number of English books is 50 / 2 = 25.
10% of the books are written in German, so the number of German books is 50 * 0.1 = 5.

The total number of books written in English and German is 25 + 5 = 30.
Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find out how many gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. 
There are 16 cups in a gallon. 
So, 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Romeo boards a train with 120 people. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's start with the tank top, which costs $10. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.

Next, we have the tennis shoes. They were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. To find the sale price, we divide the original price by 2: $48 / 2 = $24.

Now, let's talk about the athletic socks. They cost $8, and Alison had a coupon for $2 off. To find the final cost of the socks, we subtract the coupon value from the original price: $8 - $2 = $6.

Now that we have the cost of each item, let's add them up: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find James' increased insurance cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12.

Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"Let's break down the problem. Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies as they do on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, we need to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks. To do this, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4.

6 * 4 = 24

"Hi there, I'm Victor. I'd be happy to help you with your question about Leo's sticker collection.

So, let's break it down. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had a total of 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. To find the total number of stickers he has this year, we add the stickers from last year and this year: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Now, we need to add the stickers from two years ago to get the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection: 100 + 250 = 350 stickers.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas in total. So, the total number of slices is 8 * 4 = 32.

We're also given that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, which means Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes.

Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Then, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: 58"
"Let's break down the costs associated with Hannah's doctor's visit.

First, there's the cost of the cast, which is $200. 

Next, we have the cost of the doctor's visit. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit lasted for 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Hannah also needs to pay for painkillers. She needs 30 painkillers at $4 each, so the total cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Finally, there's the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6 per hour, and the minimum parking time is 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

"Let's break down James' email situation. He gets 80 emails a day. Out of those, 20% don't require a response. To find out how many emails he doesn't respond to, we need to calculate 20% of 80.

20% of 80 is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

Now, let's calculate how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

In a 5-day work week, James responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we need to calculate 70% of 20. 

70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and there are 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of coupon. The cost per small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents. The cost per big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

For 6 pounds of butter, he will need to buy 3 sets of 2 pounds. 

The cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter is:
- 3 sets * $4.00 (full price) = $12.00
- 3 sets * $2.00 (half off) = $6.00
- Total cost for 6 pounds of butter = $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending a portion of their money, we can infer that the amount they spent is the difference between their initial and final amounts.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza had as 'x'. Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money, she has 3/4 of her money left, which is $60. This means 3/4 * x = $60. To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4/3, which gives us x = $60 * (4/3) = $80.

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, so she has 2/3 of her money left, which is $60. This means 2/3 * x = $60. To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2, which gives us x = $60 * (3/2) = $90.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many bananas the monkeys eat each day by dividing 315 by 7.

315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, let's consider the eating habits of the monkeys. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten each day. 

45 (total bananas per day) - 10 (first monkey) - 14 (second monkey) = 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 
Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 pieces. 
So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"Jenny goes to the florist to buy some flowers. Roses cost $2 each and $15 for a dozen. If she bought 15 roses and arrived with five $5 bills and they only have quarters for change, how many quarters does she leave with?

To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen. 

15 roses is 1 and 3 roses. 1 dozen is 12 roses, so she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses. 

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's break down the sales to find the total amount of money Terry makes.

First, we need to calculate the total amount from the milkshakes. Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so the total amount from milkshakes is 6 x $5.50 = $33.

Next, we calculate the total amount from the burger platters. Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so the total amount from burger platters is 9 x $11 = $99.

Lastly, we calculate the total amount from the sodas. Terry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so the total amount from sodas is 20 x $1.50 = $30.

Now, let's add the total amount from each item together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Melanie has been saving toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has saved so far, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is:
2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:
1500 * 1.2 = $1800

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price he paid:
2000 - 1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
(200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%

"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish per second.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since there are 5 springs, and each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many bananas Jenny bought in total. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 bananas individually. The cost per banana is $0.80, so the total cost would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, we need to find the cost of buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence between them. They agree to split it, with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam. 

Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine its growth rate per year. We know that it grows 8 inches in 4 years. 

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month.

First, we need to find the number of each type of bike sold. We know that Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, which is 300 / 2 = 150. 

Next, we need to find the number of BMX bikes sold. We are given that 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15, which gives us 45.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105.

Now that we know the number of each type of bike sold, we can calculate the total earnings for each type of bike. The price of a Trekking bike is $450, so the total earnings from Trekking bikes is 150 * $450 = $67,500.

The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500. So, the price of a BMX bike is $500 / 2 = $250. The total earnings from BMX bikes is 45 * $250 = $11,250.

The price of an MTB is $500, and the total earnings from MTB bikes is 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike to find the total earnings: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The farmer is making 5 bales of hay per hour, and the truck is picking up 3 bales per hour. They both work for 6 hours.

First, we need to find out how many bales the farmer makes in 6 hours. To do this, we multiply the number of bales made per hour by the number of hours worked: 5 * 6 = 30.

Next, we need to find out how many bales the truck picks up in 6 hours. We do this by multiplying the number of bales picked up per hour by the number of hours worked: 3 * 6 = 18.

Now, we need to find out how many bales are left in the field. To do this, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and the extra time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total minutes John spends in class. He has 6 periods a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, we multiply the minutes per day by the number of days: 
6 periods * 40 minutes per period = 240 minutes per day
240 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1200 minutes per week

However, John also has 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long. We need to add these to the total minutes per week: 
2 classes * 40 minutes per class = 80 minutes per day
80 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 400 minutes per week
1200 minutes per week + 400 minutes per week = 1600 minutes per week

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 
First, let's find the total minutes in a week: 
7 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 1680 minutes per week
1/16 * 1680 minutes per week = 105 minutes per day
105 minutes per day * 2 days = 210 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes, and the extra minutes for Saturday and Sunday: 
1600 minutes per week + 210 minutes per week = 1810 minutes per week

Finally, let's convert the total minutes to hours: 
1810 minutes per week / 60 minutes per hour = 30.17 hours per week

First, let's convert the height of the first child to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height of the first child in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

"To find out how much the orchard earned from selling apples, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. This 270 kilograms was half of what the velociraptors had. 

To find out how much the velociraptors had, we multiply 270 by 2. That gives us 540 kilograms. 

Now, we know that the velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate. To find out how much the T-Rex ate, we multiply 540 by 2. That gives us 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops must be double what the T-Rex ate. So, we multiply 1080 by 2 to get the original weight of the triceratops.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's break down the situation. Ellen initially had 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas. Then, her brother came along and took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 14.29%."
"Let's break down the problem. We have two trains departing from a station in opposite directions. One train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the other is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the distance each train has traveled after 3 hours, we multiply their speeds by the time. The first train has traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles. The second train has traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them. So, 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many people Billy helps, we first need to determine the total number of days he's available to help. We know that the period in question spans from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, multiply the number of days Billy helps by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he helps: 
40 * 6 = 240

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present. However, the question does not provide the total number of people present. 

Let's start by calculating the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported (i.e., 480 people) since the question does not provide any other information.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than him. To find Martha's age, we subtract 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we add 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed of the slide. 

For the biggest slide: time = length / speed = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: time = length / speed = 240 / 80 = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides: 
time difference = time for biggest slide - time for second biggest slide = 5 - 3 = 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Bobby's daily schedule. He takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 

The total time spent on breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.
The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so we can calculate Micah's miles by multiplying 8 by 3.5.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down Sheila's credit card transactions step by step.

First, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. Then, she returned one item that cost $15.00. This means we need to subtract the return from the initial charge.

Initial charge: $85.00
Return: -$15.00
New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. We calculate the discount similarly.

Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the new balance.

Total cost of new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

Finally, we add the new purchases to the previous balance.

New balance: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's dive into the problem. We have a jellyfish tank with an unknown number of jellyfish. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

The final answer is: 90"

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement and then determine how many years it will take her to save that amount.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, her annual savings will be:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

Next, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary in retirement, her annual retirement income will be:

Annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

Total savings needed = Annual retirement income * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Now, we need to calculate how many years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of $20,000 per year:

Number of years = Total savings needed / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can find the total number of students by dividing the number of boys by the decimal equivalent of 40%.

40% as a decimal is 0.4. 

Now, let's divide the number of boys by this decimal: 240 / 0.4 = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how much money my mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the coupon discount.

The cost of the pots is $19 and the cost of the garden soil is $26.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

"Let's break down the problem. Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. We need to find out how many kilograms Jacques will have left after Pierre and Paul take their share.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 
Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Now, to find out how much Jacques will have left, we subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount: 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to consider the changes in temperature. The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight, which means we subtract 8 from the initial temperature. Then, it increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning, so we add 3 to the result.

Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature - Temperature drop + Temperature increase
= 2 - 8 + 3

After buying the 2 books, she had $2 left, so she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

The final answer is: $5"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

The previous year's enrollment was 50 students. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 0.20 by 50, which equals 10 students.

Now, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60 students.

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to determine the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

"Let's break down the information given. Tate initially has 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. He then buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies. The initial number of male guppies is 4, and he buys 2 more, so the total number of male guppies is 4 + 2 = 6. The initial number of female guppies is 7, and he buys 1 more, so the total number of female guppies is 7 + 1 = 8.

Next, let's calculate the total number of male and female goldfishes. The initial number of male goldfishes is 3, and he buys 2 more, so the total number of male goldfishes is 3 + 2 = 5. The initial number of female goldfishes is 5, and he buys 3 more, so the total number of female goldfishes is 5 + 3 = 8.

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes. The total number of male fishes is the sum of male guppies and male goldfishes, which is 6 + 5 = 11. The total number of female fishes is the sum of female guppies and female goldfishes, which is 8 + 8 = 16.

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes: 16 - 11 = 5.

"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a one-way trip and multiply it by 2. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 4 workers who produce toys at different rates. 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work for 10 hours.

First, let's find the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers in 10 hours. The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. 

The total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 10 hours is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. The fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys, which is 420 - 200 = 220 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour is 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we can find its weight by dividing 60 by 4. 

60 / 4 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we can find its weight by dividing 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30 pounds

Now, we need to find the total weight of all the dogs. We have Elijah's two dogs, which weigh 15 pounds and 30 pounds, and Kory's dog, which weighs 60 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. John buys 3 large bags of M&M's, each weighing 10 ounces. We need to find out how many small bags he can make if each small bag contains 10 M&M's.

First, we need to find the total number of M&M's in the large bags. Since each ounce contains 30 M&M's, we multiply the total weight of the large bags by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now that we know there are 900 M&M's, we can find the number of small bags by dividing the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so we can denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A and Madeline as M, and we can say A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so C + S = 30.

Additionally, we know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so C = S + 12.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S + 12 + S = 30, which simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them into boxes, with each box holding 8 crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

To find out how many boxes Nik will need, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we need to find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of their individual weights: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of it, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, we divide 64 by 4 to find the number of logs, as each log is 4 feet.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

"Let's break down Grandma's walking routine. She walks 3 miles every day, consisting of 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. To find her speed on the beach, we can use the formula distance/speed = time. Since the distance on the beach is 2 miles and the time is 40 minutes, we can set up the equation 2/x = 40, where x is her speed in miles per minute.

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute. This is her speed on the beach.

Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time spent walking on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. Using the formula time = distance/speed, we get time = 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, Bob will have 60 + 24 = 84 marbles after receiving 2 dozen more marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles. Let's call the number of marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles 'x'. Then, x + 24 = 84. To find 'x', we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 84 - 24 = 60.

Now that we know Bob has 60 marbles before receiving 2 dozen more marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 60: 60 - 10 = 50.

"Let's dive into the problem. We have two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature, x. Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. After this, he's able to drink the water, which means the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees.

To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the average temperature of the two mugs multiplied by the total ounces of water in the bottle. The total ounces is 5 (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug). 

The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40.

Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 / 2 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 >= 80
165 + 5x >= 80
5x >= 80 - 165
5x >= -85
x >= -85 / 5
x >= -17

However, the problem asks for the minimum temperature of the second bottle, so we need to find the minimum value of x that satisfies the condition. Since x cannot be negative, the minimum value of x is 40 degrees.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. We need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately after three weeks.

First, let's find the number of cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 21 days in three weeks, the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows. Adding this to the initial 50 cows, we get 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows.

Next, let's find the number of chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. The total number of chickens added in three weeks is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens. Adding this to the initial 20 chickens, we get 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.

Now, we add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks. Total number of animals = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, and each pack costs $10.00 with 9 bagels in it. To find the total cost of 4 packs, we multiply the cost of one pack by 4.

Cost of one pack = $10.00
Total cost of 4 packs = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the total cost.
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00
Discounted cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
Number of bagels in one pack = 9
Total number of bagels in 4 packs = 4 * 9 = 36

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels.
Cost of each single bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

The final answer is: $1.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. It's given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. It's given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. Let's first find out how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

Now, we know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops. To find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops, we need to find out how many groups of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops. 18 / 2 = 9. 

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, it takes 3 * 9 = 27 potatoes to make 18 scoops.

"Let's break down Chester's egg consumption over 60 days. 

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. So, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we need to find the total number of green and red jellybeans. This is simply 17 + 34 = 51.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Tim grows 5 trees, and each tree produces 6 lemons per year. To find the total number of lemons he gets in a year, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons each tree produces:

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Since a decade has 10 years, we need to multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10 to find the total number of lemons in a decade:

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

The fraction of women in the ratio is 9/14. 

To find the number of women on the bus, we multiply the fraction of women by the total number of passengers: (9/14) * 84 = 54.

Now, we subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquet per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to get the number of bouquets sold per day.

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 12 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets.

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Next, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold per day from the individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from the sunflowers per day, we can divide $26 by $2 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day.

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can add the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

The final answer is: 291"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam has $100 to invest in his rock stand. He buys rocks for $5 each and sells them for $7 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * $5 = $100

However, since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 + $40 = $140

Since Adam only made $84 from selling the rocks, we subtract the revenue from the total cost to find out how much money he loses:

$140 - $84 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum of these values.

For large-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 5 scenes per day. To find the number of days it will take her to draw 45 large-sized scenes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days.

For medium-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 6 scenes per day. To find the number of days it will take her to draw 36 medium-sized scenes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days.

For small-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 7 scenes per day. To find the number of days it will take her to draw 49 small-sized scenes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days.

The maximum of these values is 9 days, so it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

"Let's break down the situation. Patricia initially had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother. To find out how many roses she has left, we subtract the roses she gave away from the initial number of roses.

30 (initial roses) - 24 (roses given away) = 6

After giving away 24 roses, Patricia had 6 roses left. Then, she bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add the roses she bought to the remaining roses.

6 (remaining roses) + 15 (roses bought) = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

"Let's break down the problem. Mark buys two lottery tickets, one with a 20% chance of winning and the other with a 60% chance of winning (since it's three times more likely to win).

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The probability of the first ticket winning is 0.2 (20% in decimal form). The probability of the second ticket winning is 0.6 (60% in decimal form).

The probability of both tickets winning is 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carlos collected as C. Then, Jim collected C + 5 seashells.
   Since Jim collected 27 seashells, we can write the equation: C + 5 = 27.
   Solving for C, we get C = 22.

2. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. 
   Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as R. Then, Carlos collected 2R seashells.
   We already know that Carlos collected 22 seashells, so we can write the equation: 2R = 22.
   Solving for R, we get R = 11.

Now we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells.

They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. 
The total number of seashells is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.
To find out how many seashells each person gets, we divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people):
60 / 3 = 20

On the weekend, Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, let's add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
Total carrots eaten in a week = 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is 60% as a decimal). 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes and 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Linus bought a mobile device for $20 and sold it for twice the amount of the original price, which is $40. 

On Monday, he bought 2 devices for $20 each, so the total cost price for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. The total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, he bought 4 devices for $20 each, so the total cost price for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. The total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than her. 

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2.

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2

"To determine how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Carla has 8 identical octuplets. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. 

First, we need to find out how many babies are wearing purple and how many are wearing blue. Since 3/4 of the babies are wearing purple, that's 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies. And 1/4 of the babies are wearing blue, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies.

Now, let's find out how many babies are wearing purple and bows. Since 1/3 of the purple babies are also wearing bows, that's 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies.

We also know that 2 babies are wearing blue and bows. So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (purple and bows) + 2 (blue and bows) = 4 babies.

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiply by 100.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land.

First, Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. To find the total number of eggs hidden, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's consider the number of eggs found by each person:

- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of apartments. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree first. Let's call the production of a 10-year-old tree 'x'. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. 

Now we can find the production of an 8-year-old tree: x - 200 = 1000, x = 1200. 

So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits.

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three ropes: red, blue, and yellow. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. We know that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can express the combined length of the ropes as R + B + Y = 37. Substituting R = 4B into this equation, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Now, substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37. This gives us 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37. Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12. Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. If Ronnie was given $5, then Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.
(15 - x) = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

"Let's break down the information given about the wall mural. There are four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. We know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Additionally, we're told that half the mural is yellow, and the total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. 
Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

"Let's break down the problem. We have a regular box of 100 dishwasher pods that costs $12. There's a special size box for the same price that has 20% more pods. 

First, we need to find out how many pods are in the new box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12.

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days he can use the chalk after Monday.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the number of girls on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.

Next, we need to find the number of boys on varsity. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity. 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students. 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought, and then calculate three times that amount and add 2.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 
Three times the amount Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15.
Johnny bought 2 more than that, so Johnny bought 15 + 2 = 17 face masks.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. James has 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. 

First, we need to find the number of teeth the dentist caps. Since the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, and he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth he caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we need to find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. This is the sum of the teeth he drills and the teeth he caps, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, and then multiply by 100. So, (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the amount of milk that was returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons. 

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons of milk were returned.

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.

Refund = 1600 * 3.5 = 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

"To find out how many books Bob can buy in total, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

Total books = Total money / Cost per 100 books
Total books = $27000 / $500
Total books = 54

Since Bob is distributing the money to 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 54 / 3
Books per school = 18

"Let's break down the events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples. Total apples = 1 (in pocket) + 5 (new) = 6.
3. He put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 5 apples in his pocket. Total apples = 1 (outside) + 5 (in pocket) = 6.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples. Total apples = 6 (from previous step) + 6 (new) = 12.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, so he now has 12 apples in total.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples."
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to calculate the number of bags of coal he ordered and multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, let's find the number of bags: 
Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, we know the cost per bag is $18. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18

The final answer is: $306"
"To figure out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat, and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. To find out how many snowballs he builds per minute, we divide 20 by 60, which gives us 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find out how many snowballs melt per minute, we divide 2 by 15, which gives us 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, let's find the net rate of snowballs by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate: (1/3) - (2/15). To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15. So, we can rewrite 1/3 as 5/15. Now we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3, which gives us 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how long it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. To do this, we divide the number of snowballs by the rate: 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

John's age 20 years ago would be 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, Jim's age 20 years ago would be 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to Jim's age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

So, Jim is 24 years old."

"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 50 / 2 = 25).
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages (since they ordered 1 pack of 50).
After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages.
After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100 bandages (since they ordered 2 packs of 50).

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

"Let's break down Jen's earnings for April. She works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and her hourly rate is $1.5. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April.

Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours. To find her regular pay, we multiply her total hours worked by her hourly rate: 180 * $1.5 = $270.

In addition to her regular pay, Jen also receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings: $270 + $240 = $510.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

First, let's calculate the amount of water removed on each setting. The low setting removes 1 liter per day, so in 3 days, it removes 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. In 3 days, it removes 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. In 5 days, it removes 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, let's add up the total amount of water removed: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many balloons were thrown during the water balloon fight, we need to calculate the total number of balloons and then subtract the number of balloons left.

First, we find the total number of balloons: 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.

Then, we subtract the number of balloons left: 300 - 12 = 288.

So, they threw 288 balloons during the water balloon fight.

The final answer is: 288"
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the capacity of John's classes, we need to find 1/8 of Ali's class capacity. 

Ali's class capacity is 120 students. 
1/8 of 120 is 120 / 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 
Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

The final answer is: 150"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. 

First, we need to calculate the interest he owes. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

Now, we need to find the remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. This is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's break down the problem. Jordan has 2 children, and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day. So, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. This means Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume. 

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed. 

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Pauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. Initially, the cost of one visit is $2. 

For the first 5 years, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. To find the total cost for these 5 years, we multiply the annual cost by 5: 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's consider the cost increase. The cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

To find the total cost for all visits, we add the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from the total number of students. 

There are 4 grades (4-7), and each grade has 10 students. So, the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many groups can be formed: 40 / 8 = 5.

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, and there are 5 groups. Therefore, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"Hi there, I'm Victor. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Ian has a 40-foot board and he wants to make a cut so he can have two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To figure out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total seasoning needed.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much fabric Luke should buy, we need to calculate the total width of the windows first. 

The width of one window is 35 inches, and there are 5 windows in total. 

Total width of windows = 35 * 5 = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total cost of the call, we need to calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, we need to find out how many cupcakes Carly made.

Let's say the number of cupcakes is x. Then, the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies. So, we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation: 
x + 3x - 2 = 10
4x - 2 = 10
4x = 12
x = 3

"To find the total cost, let's start with the manicure and pedicure prices. A basic manicure starts at $35, and a pedicure starts at $40. If Karen chooses to get both, the salon offers a 20% discount on the total price of both.

The discount on the manicure is 20% of $35, which is 0.2 * 35 = $7. 
The discount on the pedicure is 20% of $40, which is 0.2 * 40 = $8.

The total discount is $7 + $8 = $15.

The cost of the manicure after the discount is $35 - $7 = $28.
The cost of the pedicure after the discount is $40 - $8 = $32.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $28 + $32 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

First, let's calculate the price increase in December. An 80% increase from the initial price of $40 is:
Price increase = 80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we'll calculate the price decrease in January. A 50% decrease from the price in December is:
Price decrease = 50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"Let's break down Charlie's income for the day. He has 4 standard rate lessons and 2 reduced rate lessons. 

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie charges $80 per hour. 
Total amount from standard rate lessons = 4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie charges 75% of his standard rate, which is $80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour.
Total amount from reduced rate lessons = 2 * $60 = $120

To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we add the amounts from the standard and reduced rate lessons together.
Total amount of money Charlie will make for the day = $320 + $120 = $440

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Walter bought 60 apples from the store. He ate 2/5 of them. To find out how many apples he ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining.

60 - 24 = 36

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25.

25% of 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply 27 by 3.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is 36 / 12 = 3 pies.

Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) + 36 (by their mother) = 102 grapes.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We know that B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B into the second equation, we get S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know there are 110 chips in total, we need to divide that by the number of family members, which is 5. 

110 / 5 = 22

So, each person in Mitchell's family will get 22 chips."
"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to add up the time it takes for each side. 

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each. 
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides: 
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the information given: Dominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there. If there were 20 helmets, we can calculate the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Next, we know there are half as many helmets as footballs. This means the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together: 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call. 

First, we need to convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

To find out how many calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5: 24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

The final answer is: 120"

"To determine how long it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes to cover each half of the distance and add them together.

Since Phineas is 200 yards away from home, half of the distance is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

Time taken to cover 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute is 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

Time taken to cover 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute is 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Total time taken to return home is 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have five phones on a phone plan, and the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. The main phone costs $20.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, Derrick makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

The price of each doughnut is $2. So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in a day is 120 * $2 = $240.

June has 30 days. Therefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is $240 * 30 = $7200.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he becomes 2.5 times faster. 

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words.

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, we can divide the total number of words by the new speaking speed.

Time = Total words / New speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Conor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun. On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were present at the beach than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, which is 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people he saw on the first three days to the number of people he saw on the remaining days: 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with popcorn popping at different rates over a series of 30-second intervals.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 

In the next 30 seconds, the rate triples, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, the rate quadruples, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the rate halves, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

The final answer is: 210"
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make. He's making 4 gallons for the party and an extra gallon for his friend Allen. 

Total gallons = 4 + 1 = 5 gallons

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many cups of juice are needed for 5 gallons.

Total cups of juice = 5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade. This lemonade is twice as tart as the other gallons, which means it requires twice the amount of lemon juice. 

Extra tart lemonade cups = 1 gallon * 2 = 2 cups

Total lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade = 2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons

Total lemons needed for the regular lemonade = 5 cups - 2 cups = 3 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 3/6 * 6 = 3 lemons

Total lemons needed = 2 lemons (for the extra tart lemonade) + 3 lemons (for the regular lemonade) = 5 lemons

The final answer is: 5"

"To find the total number of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals separately and then add them together.

For 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs
For 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs

Total number of legs = 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since the question asks for pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs.

Total pairs of legs = 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

"Let's break down the problem. We know there are 4 blue blocks in the tower. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks by multiplying the number of blue blocks by 2. 

4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks

Now, we know the total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12 blocks.

To find the number of red blocks, we need to subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks in the tower, which is 32.

32 - 12 = 20

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

"Let's break down Elvis's journey. He travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph. To find the distance traveled west, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.

Then, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18mph. To find the distance traveled east, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far he is from his house now. 

The distance traveled west is 90 miles, and the distance traveled east is 144 miles. The difference is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's break down the depreciation of the boat over the three years.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, it depreciated by 30%, which means it lost 30% of its value. To find the depreciation amount, we multiply the initial value by 0.3: 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. So, the value after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%. We apply the same calculation: 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. Subtracting this from the previous year's value, we get $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Finally, in the third year, the boat depreciated by 20%. We calculate the depreciation as 0.2 * $4410 = $882. Subtracting this from the previous year's value, we get $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a bag of Starbursts candy with a total of 232 pieces. Out of these, 54 are red. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, which is 2 * 54 = 108.

Now, let's find the number of yellow candies. It's mentioned that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so it's 54 / 2 = 27.

To find the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies, we add them together: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Now, to find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add their individual weights together. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each. 

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

Force = 1% * 1600
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we first need to figure out how many hot dogs he needs to buy for the party. 

John invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs required is:
20 * 2 = 40

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract those from the total required:
40 - 4 = 36

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total hot dogs required by the number of hot dogs per pack:
36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
6 * 2 = 12

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

In one day, the company produces 5000 bars. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, the company produces 5000 * 7 = 35000 bars.

In two weeks, the company produces 35000 * 2 = 70000 bars.

The price per bar is $2. So, the total money the company receives is 70000 * 2 = $140000.

The final answer is: $140000"
"I'd be happy to help you with Jake's shopping trip. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, but there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, he only pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"Let's break down Ryan's situation. He earns $6 each week he completes his chores, and he did his chores for 3 weeks. So, his total allowance is 6 * 3 = $18.

Next, he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Since there are 4 people in total, the cost of the ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total allowance: $18 - $5 = $13.

Finally, we need to find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy. Each ticket costs $6.50, so we'll divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the purchases made by Ellen and Lani at the mall.

Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. To find the total amount she spent, we add these two costs together: $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani, on the other hand, bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes, each costing $100. We multiply the cost of the bathrobes by 2 to get the total cost of the bathrobes: $100 x 2 = $200. Then, we add the cost of the sunglasses to get Lani's total: $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, we add the total amounts spent by Ellen and Lani to find the overall amount they spent at the mall: $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the cost of making one jar of the honey and jam mix and then multiply it by 10.

The cost of making one jar is:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

The selling price of one jar is $50.

The profit from one jar is: $50 - $44 = $6

The profit from 10 jars is: $6 * 10 = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's calculate the total dollar amount in the jar.

First, we need to find the value of each type of coin. 

- 32 quarters = 32 x $0.25 = $8
- 95 dimes = 95 x $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 x $0.05 = $6
- 750 pennies = 750 x $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together:
$8 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's break down Janet's expenses at the mall. She spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 each for two movie tickets, and $8.50 on a bracelet. 

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent on movie tickets: 2 * $7.50 = $15. 

Now, let's add up all her expenses: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27.

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract her total expenses from the amount her parents gave her: $40 - $27 = $13.

"Hi there, I'm Victor. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Josh runs a car shop and services 3 cars a day. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. He gets paid $4 per car. To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday) and not open 2 days a week (Sunday and Wednesday). So, he is open 5 days a week.

In 1 week, Josh is open 5 days, so he services 5 * 3 = 15 cars.

In 2 weeks, Josh is open 10 days, so he services 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 2 weeks, he makes 30 * $4 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the situation with Randy and his cookies. He starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. That's a total of 18 cookies.

Randy then eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This leaves him with 8 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

Next, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, leaving him with 6 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.

After that, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, which leaves him with 6 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 3 sugar cookies.

Finally, Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. This adds 4 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies to his collection.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:
6 (oatmeal) + 3 (chocolate chip) + 3 (sugar) = 12 cookies from the remaining cookies
4 (oatmeal) + 4 (chocolate chip) + 4 (sugar) = 12 cookies from the baked cookies
Total cookies now = 12 + 12 = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. He wants to sell them for a fair price. He found a buyer who is willing to pay for half his collection $5 per toy, and for the other half $7 per toy.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, he can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30.

For the second half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.

To find the total amount, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of holes dug by the dog. Since the dog digs 6 holes a day and Nate was on vacation for 14 days, we multiply the number of holes dug per day by the number of days.

Holes dug per day = 6
Days Nate was on vacation = 14
Total holes dug = 6 * 14 = 84

However, the dog digs 6 new holes every night, so we need to add these to the total holes dug during the day. Since Nate fills the holes for the same number of days he was on vacation, we'll assume he fills the holes for 14 days.

Holes dug at night = 6 * 14 = 84
Total holes = 84 + 84 = 168

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 / 3
Days to fill holes = 56

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7.

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Average enrollment at Norman High School: 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School: 4000 * (3/4) = 3000 students

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in enrollment: 4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The final answer is: 2325"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: This statement is incorrect, but we can infer that Igor gathered 2 more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested. So, if he gathered 2 more test tubes than Petri dishes, then he gathered 14 - 2 = 12 Petri dishes.
- Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 12 Petri dishes = 27 items.

Since Igor had 29 items on the lab bench, he must have lost 29 - 27 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. James is putting together 4 tables, and each table has 4 legs. Since each leg needs 2 screws, we need to find out how many screws are required for all the legs.

First, we calculate the total number of legs: 4 tables * 4 legs per table = 16 legs.

Next, we calculate the total number of screws needed for the legs: 16 legs * 2 screws per leg = 32 screws.

Now, we know James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem. We have 10 eggs in the first basket. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, we need to multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2 to find the number of eggs in the second basket.

So, 10 eggs * 2 = 20 eggs in the second basket.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Alexandra raises $430. Since Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, we can calculate Kim's total as $430 + $320 = $750.

Next, we're told that Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam's total is $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes, Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x minutes.

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance of Vanessa (since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron), we can set up the equation:

x * 2 = 16 (since Aaron ran half the distance of Vanessa, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile:
Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. 

Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3: 
200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

He already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total amount needed: 
600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

First, we need to find the daily revenue. Since each reservation includes 2 meals and a bottle of wine, the cost per reservation is (2 * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15.

Now, we multiply the cost per reservation by the number of reservations to get the daily revenue: $15 * 6 = $90.

Since Tom's restaurant is open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days they are open to get the weekly revenue: $90 * 2 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the cost of each watermelon, we need to first find the total selling price of all the watermelons. 

The profit percentage is 25%, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit). 

The cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Let's find the cost price of 1 watermelon: 
Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

Now, let's find the selling price of 1 watermelon:
Selling price of 50 watermelons = 125% of $80
Selling price of 50 watermelons = (125/100) * $80 = $100
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John had James when he was 19. This means the time that has passed since then is 18 - 19 = -1 year. However, since age cannot be negative, this indicates that the information given is inconsistent.

But let's continue with the problem as if the information is correct. We need to find the current age of John's youngest son, who was born when John was 32. This means John's youngest son's current age is 32.

In 3 years, his age will be 32 + 3 = 35 years.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange and Jane spends 4 minutes doing the same. If they start peeling oranges at the same time, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 60 by the time it takes Ana to peel an orange, which is 3 minutes. This gives us 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour. We divide 60 by the time it takes Jane to peel an orange, which is 4 minutes. This gives us 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges peeled by Jane from the number of oranges peeled by Ana: 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

So, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the costs for Mark's new radiator. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400, and Mark gets an 80% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original cost by the discount percentage: 400 * 0.8 = $320. 

Now, subtract the discount from the original cost to get the discounted price: 400 - 320 = $80.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * 50 = $150.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost: 80 + 150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals on his farm, and they are all either chickens or cows. We also know that the total number of legs is 70.

Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can set up the following equation: 2C + 4W = 70.

We also know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can set up another equation: C + W = 20.

Now, let's solve for W in the second equation: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the first equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

So, the number of chickens on the farm is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.
