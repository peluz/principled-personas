"Let's break down Janet's daily egg sales. She lays 16 eggs per day. For breakfast, she eats 3 eggs, and she bakes 4 eggs for her friends. 

To find out how many eggs she has left, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 

So, she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber required. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half that much white fiber, we calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down Josh's house-flipping project. He bought the house for $80,000 and then invested $50,000 in repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the new value of the house, we need to calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value. 
150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 
So, the new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Now, let's find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs:
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon.

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed per meal: 
60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"I'd be happy to help Kylar figure out how much he needs to pay for the glasses. 

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8, which is 0.6 * $1.8 = $1.08. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% each time. 

Let's find the pattern: 
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $5 * 0.6 = $3.
- The third glass costs $3 * 0.6 = $1.8.
- The fourth glass costs $1.8 * 0.6 = $1.08.
- The fifth glass costs $1.08 * 0.6 = $0.648.
- The sixth glass costs $0.648 * 0.6 = $0.3888.
- The seventh glass costs $0.3888 * 0.6 = $0.23328.
- The eighth glass costs $0.23328 * 0.6 = $0.139968.
- The ninth glass costs $0.139968 * 0.6 = $0.0839856.
- The tenth glass costs $0.0839856 * 0.6 = $0.05039136.
- The eleventh glass costs $0.05039136 * 0.6 = $0.030234816.
- The twelfth glass costs $0.030234816 * 0.6 = $0.0181407896.
- The thirteenth glass costs $0.0181407896 * 0.6 = $0.01088447476.
- The fourteenth glass costs $0.01088447476 * 0.6 = $0.006530684856.
- The fifteenth glass costs $0.006530684856 * 0.6 = $0.0039184109136.
- The sixteenth glass costs $0.0039184109136 * 0.6 = $0.00236104615456.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 glasses: 
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.648 + $0.3888 + $0.23328 + $0.139968 + $0.0839856 + $0.05039136 + $0.030234816 + $0.0181407896 + $0.01088447476 + $0.006530684856 + $0.0039184109136 + $0.00236104615456 = $23.016

The total cost is $23.016."
"Let's break down the information given:

Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB. The time to download 120 GB is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. The time to install the updates is 20 minutes. So, the total time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down John's trip into segments to find out how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't travel any distance during this time.

Next, he drives for half an hour at a speed of 30 mph. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

After that, he drives for the remaining 2 hours at a speed of 80 mph. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 2
Distance = 160 miles

Now, let's add up the distances he traveled in the return trip:

Total distance traveled in the return trip = 15 + 160 = 175 miles

Since John is now back home, we need to find the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours. To do this, we need to consider the distance he has traveled in the 4 hours. 

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 180 miles
Distance traveled in the return trip = 175 miles

Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 + 175 = 355 miles

However, this is the total distance he traveled, not the distance from home. To find the distance from home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled in the first 3 hours from the total distance traveled in 4 hours. 

Distance from home = Total distance traveled in 4 hours - Distance traveled in the first 3 hours
Distance from home = 355 - 180
Distance from home = 175 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 * $10 = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month, so we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts. Since she bought 3 dozen donuts and each dozen costs $68, the total cost of the donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.

Next, we'll find the cost of the mini cupcakes. She bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes, and each dozen costs $80, so the total cost of the mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.

Lastly, we'll find the cost of the mini cheesecakes. She bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes, and each dozen costs $55, so the total cost of the mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the initial cost of the lemon tree is $90. Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, generating a revenue of $10.5 per year. However, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year, resulting in a net revenue of $7.5 per year.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to calculate the time it takes for the tree to pay for itself. We can do this by dividing the initial cost by the net revenue:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.5 (net revenue) = 12 years

However, this calculation tells us when the tree will pay for itself, not when it starts earning money. Since the tree will start generating revenue in the first year, we can conclude that it will start earning money in the 1st year.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners. 

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3.

2. After selling at the green house, she had (x - x/3) = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

4. After selling at the red house, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2x/3 - 2) is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = (x/3 - 1).

5. So, she had (2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1)) = (x/3 - 1) vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.

6. We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

7. To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.

8. Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a dance class with 20 students. First, 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance. To find this number, we multiply 20 by 0.2:

20 * 0.2 = 4 students

Now, we need to find out how many students are left. We subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students:

20 - 4 = 16 students

Next, 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. To find this number, we multiply 16 by 0.25:

16 * 0.25 = 4 students

Now, we know that 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance and 4 students enrolled in jazz dance. To find the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

So, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine which purchase plan will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each option.

For the jewelry, a 2.5% increase in value would be 0.025 * $5,000 = $125.

For the electronic gadgets, a 1.2% increase in value would be 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Since the jewelry has a higher potential increase in value, the merchant should choose the jewelry.

The profit would be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

Let's break it down step by step. We have two trains that leave San Rafael at the same time and travel in the same direction for the first day, which is westward. They cover a distance of 80 miles each.

The next day, they change direction and travel northward, covering 150 miles each.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem helps us find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.

In this case, the two sides of the right-angled triangle are the distances covered by the train on the first and second days. 

So, the total distance covered by each train is the square root of (80^2 + 150^2).

Let's calculate that:

Total distance = √(80^2 + 150^2)
Total distance = √(6400 + 22500)
Total distance = √28900
Total distance = 170 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 170 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. Jill gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked per year to get the total hours worked per year: 35 * 50 = 1750. Then, we multiply the total hours worked per year by her hourly wage: 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. Jill gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week as a coach. Again, we multiply the hours worked per week by the number of weeks worked per year: 15 * 50 = 750. Then, we multiply the total hours worked per year by her hourly wage: 750 * $30 = $22,500.

Now, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching to get her total annual salary: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks and multiply it by the number of eggs she eats per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Claire eats 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down Marissa's hike. She's already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and another 2 miles in 1 hour, so she's covered a total of 6 miles in 2 hours.

To find the total time she needs to complete the 12-mile hike at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can divide the total distance by her desired average speed:

Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since she's already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 10 liters of orange drink that is two-thirds water. To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Next, we have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before spilling. The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

However, we spill 1 liter of the orange drink. To find the remaining amount of water, we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water. The remaining amount of water is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Since we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we need to find the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink and the pineapple drink. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the orange drink is (1/3) * 9.33 = 3.11 liters.
Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the 9.33 liters of non-water liquid in the pineapple drink is (2/5) * 9.33 = 3.732 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 + 3.11 + 3.732 = 21.512 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21.51}$"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Samantha is 31 years old, and Raymond was born 6 years before her. This means Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we need to find out how many years have passed since then. To do this, we subtract the age at which he had a son from his current age: 25 - 23 = 2.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"Let's break down the number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday.

He has 8 customers, and the first 3 customers buy one DVD each. So, they buy a total of 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.

The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they buy a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything for them.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To find out how much shorter a candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns for 4 hours, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

Total melting = rate * time
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
Total melting = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since the book was sold with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased other than the pizza boxes. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15, and the cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

Adding these costs together, we get $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Now, we subtract this total from the amount Marie paid, which is $50. This gives us $50 - $33 = $17. 

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total amount Mishka spent on clothing items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the shorts: 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the pants: 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.

Now, let's find the cost of the shoes: 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each is 3 x $42 = $126.

Finally, we add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons she needs, we divide 60 by 15:
60 / 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

"I'm Fatima, and I'd be happy to help you with Gloria's shoe shopping dilemma. Let's break down the information given. We know that Gloria has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, and one pair of heels costs $33. The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair.

Since the more expensive pair of heels costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, we can calculate its cost as 2 * 33 = $66.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the situation: the cost of the boots (B) is equal to the cost of the less expensive pair of heels ($33) plus the cost of the more expensive pair of heels ($66), minus the $5 difference. This gives us the equation B = 33 + 66 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

So, the boots cost $94."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"Let's break down the guesses. The first person thinks there are 80 jelly beans in the jar. The second person thinks there are 20 more than half of the first one, which is 40 + 20 = 60. The third person thinks there are 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100.

To find the average, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of people. The total number of guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. There are 3 people.

The average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Hello there. To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to calculate the total time he spends on them each day and then multiply that by 7.

First, let's find the total time John spends on his dogs daily. He has 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.

Total time per day = Number of dogs * Time per dog
Total time per day = 10 * 0.5
Total time per day = 5 hours

Now, we need to multiply the total time per day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

Total time per week = Total time per day * 7
Total time per week = 5 * 7
Total time per week = 35 hours

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We can write an equation based on the given information: G = S + 30.

We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can write another equation: S + G = 110.

Now, let's substitute G = S + 30 into the second equation: S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the information given to us about the jewels.

We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. To find out how many jewels Aaron has, we need to calculate half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5 to that number. Half of 40 is 20, and 20 + 5 is 25. So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

Now, we're told that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total. 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down Mike's ping pong game. He played for 40 minutes, which is divided into two 20-minute segments. 

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 

Now, let's calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. He scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which equals 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total points, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in that time frame. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys. To do this, we divide the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per set: 60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per set = 15 sets.

Since each set costs $5.00, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set to find the total amount spent: 15 sets * $5.00 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. John sells his 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = 195 dollars.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is 8 * 20 = 160 dollars.

John also has $5 left, which means he spent 195 - 5 = 190 dollars on the video games.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $35, which is the amount he used from his own money. 
35 / 15 = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't sell a fraction of a Lego set)

However, we know he sold 13 Lego sets in total. So, he must have sold 2 Lego sets with his own money and the remaining 11 sets with the money from the Lego sales.

Therefore, John still has 13 - 2 = 11 Lego sets left.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time and then divide the total distance by the total time.

John runs 3 hours the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we need to multiply the total running time by 3 to get the total weekly running time.
Total weekly running time = 6 hours * 3 = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.
Speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 18 hours = 3.33 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to determine her walking and running speeds. We know that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, and it's half as fast as her running speed. So, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4. This gives us 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends walking and running. We know she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time she spends walking is 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours, and the time she spends running is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles, and the distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

The original distance Polly can throw the javelin is 400 feet. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther than that.

Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"Let's break down the problem. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon. Each pie was cut into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you can still consume. Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you've already consumed 1800 calories. 

To find the remaining calories, we subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Now, we know a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams you can eat, we multiply the number of servings you can still have by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's calculate Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles.

First, we need to find out how much it costs Charlie to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost of the beeswax is $20.00. 

Next, we need to find out how much Charlie earns from selling 20 candles. Each candle sells for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is $40.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. 

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with Meredith's article writing schedule.

To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Total number of articles written in 3 days = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She then purchased a package of Post-it notes and used 220 of them at work. After that, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to determine the total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package. We can do this by adding the initial Post-it notes and the ones she purchased, then subtracting the ones she used.

Let's call the number of Post-it notes in the package 'x'. The total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package is 80 (initial) + x (package) - 220 (used) + 23 (remaining).

Since the total Post-it notes after purchasing the package is equal to the sum of the initial Post-it notes, the Post-it notes used, and the Post-it notes remaining, we can set up the equation:

x + 23 = 80 + 220 - 23

Simplifying the equation:
x + 23 = 277 - 23
x + 23 = 254
x = 254 - 23
x = 231

The final answer is: 231"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie: 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. We know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the red ties cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

To find the total cost of red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie: 10 * 60 = $600.

Finally, we add the cost of blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

"To find out how much Lloyd makes from his egg farm per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week:
Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily production by 7:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens are produced per week:
1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"Let's break down Tom's journey. He travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is a 3-hour period. Since his ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, the distance covered during this time is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

Now, let's calculate the time it took to travel 30 miles at 10 miles per hour. It's simply 30 miles / 10 miles per hour = 3 hours.

For the return journey, the distance remains the same, 30 miles. However, his ship's speed is now 6 mph. To find the time taken for the return journey, we divide the distance by the speed: 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, the total time Tom spent traveling is 3 hours (one way) + 5 hours (return journey) = 8 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, and he removes 30 of them. To find the total weight of the comic books, we multiply the weight of one comic book by the number of comic books: 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can calculate the number of toys by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy. The remaining weight is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. So, we divide 7.5 by 0.5 to get the number of toys: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from truck and car tires on both Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360, and the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.

Now, we need to compare the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. Thursday's revenue is $520, and Friday's revenue is $480. Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue.

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue. The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"I'm Fatima, and I'm happy to help you with the problem. So, the Doubtfire sisters have 7 adorable kittens from the local animal shelter. But that's not all - their mom just called to tell them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens too.

Let's start by counting the kittens from the shelter. They have 7 of those. Now, Patchy, the first cat, has had three times as many kittens as the ones from the shelter. That's 3 * 7 = 21 kittens from Patchy.

And then there are the kittens from Trixie, the other cat. She's had 12 little furballs.

To find the total number of kittens, we just add them all up: 7 (from the shelter) + 21 (from Patchy) + 12 (from Trixie) = 40.

The total cost of the cell phones is $750 + $15 = $765.

Since Shiela is paying in installments for 3 months, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find the monthly payment.

The monthly payment is $765 / 3 = $255.

The final answer is: $255"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Artie's flower stand problem. 

To find the total amount Artie will make, we need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar and then multiply the rounded price by the number of pots sold.

The price of marigolds is $2.74, which rounds to $3. The price of petunias is $1.87, which rounds to $2. The price of begonias is $2.12, which rounds to $2.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Artie will make from each type of flower:

Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the amounts together to find the total:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level will have half the square footage of the top level, which is 16 / 2 = 8.
The third level will have half the square footage of the second level, which is 8 / 2 = 4.
The fourth level will have half the square footage of the third level, which is 4 / 2 = 2.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$"
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in that time.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find David's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 4. David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we can find Raymond's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2. Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, let's find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to compare the cost per flower of each package. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers.
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the grooming is $100. To find 30% of this amount, we multiply it by 0.3.

Discount amount = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the final cost.

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

The final answer is: $70"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much water the girls got. Since they each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, we can calculate this by multiplying 24 by 1/6.

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Next, we know that a boy got 6 liters of water. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy. 
Total water taken = 8 (by girls) + 6 (by boy) = 14 liters

Now, let's subtract the total water taken from the initial amount of water. 
Water left = 24 - 14 = 10 liters

"Let's break down Charlie's sticker situation step by step.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. Then, he bought 21 more from a store, bringing his total to 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

Next, he received 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

After that, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, which means he now has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times what Grace weighs and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. 

4 times what Grace weighs is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

To find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"Let's calculate the total number of thorns. We have 3 rose bushes, and each of them has 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply these numbers together.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75
Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's break down the problem. We know that the football team played a total of 22 games. We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost. 

Let's denote the number of games they lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We can set up two equations based on this information: W = L + 8 and W + L = 22.

We can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7

Now that we know L, we can find W: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

So, the team won 15 games.

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

He goes on 4 vacations per year, so the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The alarm rings three times a day, and we need to find the total number of times it rang.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 10% increase for 5 years, and then calculate the salary for the next 3 years.

The initial salary is $600. An increase of 10% of $600 is $60. So, the salary after 5 years is $600 + ($60 * 5) = $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next 3 years. Since the increase is 10% of the current salary, we will apply the increase to the salary after 5 years.

The increase for the next year is 10% of $900, which is $90. So, the salary after 6 years is $900 + $90 = $990. 

For the next year, the increase is 10% of $990, which is $99. So, the salary after 7 years is $990 + $99 = $1089.

For the next year, the increase is 10% of $1089, which is $109.1. So, the salary after 8 years is $1089 + $109.1 = $1198.1.

For the next year, the increase is 10% of $1198.1, which is $119.81. So, the salary after 9 years is $1198.1 + $119.81 = $1317.91.

The final answer is: $1317.91"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we denote the number of copies Harald sold as H, then the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Christina's party planning. To find out how much she'll spend on gift bags, we need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of guests.

16 (total guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed for the picnic, we need to calculate the amount eaten by adults and children separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how much the adults will eat. Since there are 20 adults and each adult will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, the total amount eaten by adults is 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much the children will eat. Since children eat half as much as adults, and there are 5 children, the total amount eaten by children is 5 * (10 / 2) = 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the amount eaten by adults and children to find the total amount of potato salad needed: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

The final answer is: 225"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find Gerald's original time. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we add 2 seconds to Lee's time. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Next, we need to find out how much Gerald's speed improved. His diet improved his speed by 10%. To find 10% of 40, we multiply 0.1 by 40, which equals 4 seconds.

Now, we subtract the improvement from Gerald's original time to find his new time. Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 must be girls.

Total students = 200
Boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given: there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, and 5 of them took an exit. This means that 25 cars drove through the traffic jam. We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.

Let's represent the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Then, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20. Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:
x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

"Hello there. I'm Fatima, and I'm happy to help you with your question. 

Mary, an avid gardener, received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate how many potted plants she has in total. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

She received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jerome had 4 friends visiting him, and we need to find the total number of doorbell rings.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. 

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we multiply 20 by 1/4, which is 5, and then add it to 20. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. We know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

"To find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to know the rate at which it covers the city and the total distance of the city.

The fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. We can use this information to find out how many 3-mile sections are in the city. The city is 42 miles across, so we divide 42 by 3 to find the number of sections.

42 / 3 = 14

This means there are 14 sections of 3 miles each in the city. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we can multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 * 10 = 140

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the inner volume of the boxes, we need to consider the dimensions of the inner space. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions.

The length of the box is 5 inches, so the inner length is 5 - 2 = 3 inches.

The width of the box is 6 inches, so the inner width is 6 - 2 = 4 inches.

The height of the box is 4 inches, so the inner height is 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback rewards.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the cashback reward per gallon is $0.20. 

Total cost of gas without rewards = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00
Total cashback rewards = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas without rewards:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"Let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice. 

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups she ate is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of rowing in feet per second: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

Now, let's divide the total time by the rate to find the total distance rowed: 64 seconds / 1.25 feet/second = 51.2 feet.

Since we are only interested in sets of 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10: 51.2 feet / 10 = 5.12 sets.

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply the number of sets by 2: 5.12 sets * 2 liters/set = 10.24 liters.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sasha has leftover lumber that she bought at a certain price, and now she wants to sell it after the prices have gone up by 50%. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each, so the total cost of these boards is 10 * $10 = $100. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each, so the total cost of these boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. So, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each, and the new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards, so the total revenue from these boards is 10 * $15 = $150. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards, so the total revenue from these boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there were initially 2 containers with 5 vehicles each at the port. This means the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we're told that the total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles imported on the second day by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

So, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's salary. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago was 0.7 * $40000 = $28000.

Four years later, both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased by 40%. To find Adrien's new salary, we need to calculate 40% of his old salary and add it to his old salary. 40% of $40000 is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000. So, Adrien's new salary is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of her old salary. 40% of $28000 is 0.4 * $28000 = $11200. So, Lylah's new salary is $28000 + $11200 = $39200.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries: $56000 + $39200 = $95200.

Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jennie is helping at her mom's office. She has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and a pile of letters already stamped. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we need to find out how many were in that pile when Jennie began.

Let's start by finding out how many letters Jennie stamped. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she must have stamped 1/3 * 60 = 20 letters.

Now, we know that after stamping 20 letters, the number of letters needing stamps is 60 - 20 = 40. However, we are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 20 letters Jennie stamped were added to the pile of already-stamped letters.

To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to subtract the number of letters she stamped from the current number of letters in the pile. So, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is 30 - 20 = 10.

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's start with the cost of the peppers. We know that each pepper costs $15. Dillon buys 20 peppers, so the total cost of peppers is 20 * $15 = $300.

Next, we need to find the cost of the watermelons. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45. Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost of watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180.

Now, let's find the cost of the oranges. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40. Dillon buys 10 oranges, so the total cost of oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

Now, let's find the total revenue from patients. We multiply the number of patients by the hourly rate charged to the patients and then by the number of hours per patient.

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour) / 60 minutes/hour = 2000 * $200/hour = $400000

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $400000 - $30000
Profit = $370000

The final answer is: $370000"
"Let's break down the situation. Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store's Santa village. 

First, a third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. To find out how many elves quit, we need to divide 60 by 3. 60 / 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit.

Now, we need to find out how many elves are left. We subtract the elves who quit from the total number of elves. 60 - 20 = 40 elves are left.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. To find out how many elves are left, we subtract 10 from 40. 40 - 10 = 30 elves are left.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June.

Expenditure in May is $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less, so the expenditure in June is $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, let's add the expenditures for the two months: $500 + $440 = $940.

The final answer is: $940"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many times each person rode the rides. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Now, we need to find the total number of rides. We can do this by adding the number of rides Pam took and the number of rides Fred took. So, 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down Walt's walking miles. On Monday, he walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total. 

41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we need to calculate the total cost of car washes per month and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15. 
So, the total cost per month is 4 * $15 = $60.

Now, multiply the total cost per month by 12 to get the total cost per year:
$60 * 12 = $720.

The final answer is: $720"
"Let's figure out how many video games Bobby has. First, we need to find out how many video games Brian has after losing 5. Brian initially has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply Brian's remaining video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times Brian's remaining video games is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"Hello there. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this by dividing 27 by 3.

27 / 3 = 9

Now that we know there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands, we need to find out how many of them are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this by multiplying 9 by 2/3.

9 * 2/3 = 6

So, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down Rory's delivery order. She orders 2 subs for $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each, and 2 cookies for $1.00 each. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee to the total cost of the items. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20:
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
- Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we need to add the $5.00 tip to the total cost with the delivery fee:
- Total cost with delivery fee and tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mark took a test with 75 questions and another test with 100 questions. He completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete it. Since he completes 5 questions per hour, he would have completed 8 * 5 = 40 questions in that time. However, he only completed 40 questions out of 75, so he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete it. At a rate of 5 questions per hour, he would have completed 6 * 5 = 30 questions in that time. However, he only completed 30 questions out of 100, so he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests: 35 + 70 = 105.

The final answer is: 105"
"Let's solve this problem together. We're given that there are 12 blue gumballs in the candy machine. We're also told that there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs.

First, we need to find four times the number of blue gumballs. To do this, we multiply 12 by 4, which gives us 48.

Now, we know that there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs. So, we add 22 to 48 to find the total number of pink gumballs.

48 + 22 = 70

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs in the candy machine.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the information given. We know there are 700 bees in total. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens. 

Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We can express the relationship between the number of worker bees and baby bees as W = 2B. We can also express the relationship between the number of baby bees and queens as B = 2Q.

Since the total number of bees is 700, we can write the equation W + B + Q = 700. Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q into the equation 3B + Q = 700, we get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Since B = 2Q, we have B = 2(100) = 200.

Since W = 2B, we have W = 2(200) = 400.

So, there are 400 worker bees.

The final answer is: 400"
"Let's calculate how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

First, we need to find out how many hours he would work in a week. Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours more each day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"Let's break down the items John bought and calculate the total cost.

First, we need to separate the food items from the non-food items. The food items are milk and eggs, which cost 2 dollars and 3 dollars respectively. So, the total cost of food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

Next, we have the non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. These items cost 3 dollars, 3 dollars, and 4 dollars respectively. So, the total cost of non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Since there's a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount. To do this, we multiply the cost of non-food items by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%): 10 * 0.1 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of non-food items: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax to get the total cost: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much profit Kim will make each week.

Kim has a total of 8 clients, which includes 3 current clients and 5 potential clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths for cleaning.

To find the total number of bottles of bleach needed, we multiply the number of clients by the number of bottles each client requires: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles.

Similarly, to find the total number of packs of cloths needed, we multiply the number of clients by the number of packs each client requires: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of bleach and cloths. The cost of bleach per bottle is $2, so the total cost of bleach is 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32. The cost of cloths per pack is $5, so the total cost of cloths is 8 packs * $5/pack = $40.

The total expenses per week are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

There are 100 pineapples per hectare. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

The final answer is: 4000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Johnny has three Lego sets on the floor. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. 

Now, let's find the number of pieces in the third set. It has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to add the number of pieces in each set together: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: 2125"
"I'd be happy to help Debra figure out how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

Let's break it down step by step. 

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.

At this point, we know that 15 bees have returned, and 30 bees have left the hive. However, we're interested in the bees that haven't returned yet. Since 15 bees returned, the number of bees that haven't returned yet is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.

Now, we need to consider the total number of bees that have left the hive so far. We have 30 bees that left initially and 60 bees that left in the last 6 hours, making a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees. However, we know that 15 bees haven't returned yet, and we're interested in the bees that left before that hadn't already returned. Since 15 bees returned in the previous step, the number of bees that left before that hadn't already returned is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 15 bees return.

The final answer is: 15"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with this problem. 

Let's break it down step by step. The cost of admission to the museum is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket. 

The total cost of the tickets would be the sum of the cost of the adult ticket and the child ticket. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up an equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Let's call the number of friends Dorothy has ""x"". Then, Charlie has 3x friends.

We know Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two racers, Steve and Tim, who are competing to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives 3 miles away from the school and can bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school and can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can calculate the distances as follows:

Steve's distance = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Steve = 15840 / 440
Time taken by Steve = 36 minutes

Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
Time taken by Tim = 10560 / 264
Time taken by Tim = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to find the difference in their times.

Difference in time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve
Difference in time = 40 - 36
Difference in time = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Shawnda is offering a bike inflation service, and she charges 25 cents per tire. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated. 5 people came by on bicycles, and each bicycle has 2 tires, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 bicycle tires. Then, 3 people came by on tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tricycle tires. Finally, 1 person came by on a unicycle, which has 1 tire.

Now, let's add up the total number of tires: 10 bicycle tires + 9 tricycle tires + 1 unicycle tire = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is 20 * 25 cents = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies inside. To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack.

Number of packs: 10
Cookies per pack: 6

Total number of cookies: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Now, we need to find the total cost of the cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie.

Total cost: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill.

Change = $10 - $6 = $4

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially. 
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 14 (by Dave) + 7 (by seagull) = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as x. 
   After the pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries were left. The raccoon ate 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   We can simplify this to (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   We can solve for x by first adding 1 to both sides: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Then, multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18.
   Finally, add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 days, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 days, the total hours per week for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Blake and Kelly are running on a 100-yard football field. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means he covers a distance of 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Now, let's calculate Kelly's distance. She runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards, Blake is the winner. To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you calculate the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the initial price is $20 and the price increases by 20% every two months.

To find the final price, I'll calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

After 2 months, the price will be:
Price = $20 + ($20 * 0.20)
= $20 + $4
= $24

After 4 months, the price will be:
Price = $24 + ($24 * 0.20)
= $24 + $4.80
= $28.80

After 6 months, the price will be:
Price = $28.80 + ($28.80 * 0.20)
= $28.80 + $5.76
= $34.56

After 8 months, the price will be:
Price = $34.56 + ($34.56 * 0.20)
= $34.56 + $6.912
= $41.472

After 10 months, the price will be:
Price = $41.472 + ($41.472 * 0.20)
= $41.472 + $8.2944

After 12 months, the price will be:
Price = $49.7664 + ($49.7664 * 0.20)
= $49.7664 + $9.95328
= $59.71968

After 14 months, the price will be:
Price = $59.71968 + ($59.71968 * 0.20)
= $59.71968 + $11.943736
= $71.663416

"Let's break down the information given. We have 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll in the room. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and one red car costs $4. If an action figure costs $5, we can calculate the total worth of all the toys.

First, let's find the cost of the doll. Since it costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure is $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of toy:
- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

To find the total worth of all the toys, we add the costs together: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"Let's break down the situation. If Jackie decides to do her taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, which means she'll lose $35 per hour in missed income. To find out how much she'll lose, we multiply the number of hours by her hourly rate:

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour
= $105

Now, let's consider the cost of hiring an accountant, which is $90. To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the income she'll lose to the cost of hiring the accountant. Since the income lost is greater than the cost of hiring the accountant, Jackie will actually be better off hiring the accountant.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she'll lose:
Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we denote Brooke's current age as B, then Seth's current age is 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and 2B + 2. The sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write an equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Ethel has $8. To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday (5 days), and 10 miles a day on Saturday and Sunday (2 days). 

So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is 20 * 5 = 100 miles. 
The total miles he walks on Saturday and Sunday is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on Saturday and Sunday: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Hello there. I'm Fatima, and I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each group and add them together. 

First, let's start with the spiders. There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. So, the total number of legs from the spiders is 80 * 8 = 640.

Next, we have the insects. There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs. So, the total number of legs from the insects is 90 * 6 = 540.

Lastly, we have the rare mutant invertebrates. There are 3 of them, and each has 10 legs. So, the total number of legs from the invertebrates is 3 * 10 = 30.

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's convert the time it takes to cut one potato from seconds to minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 5 seconds is equal to 5/60 minutes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5/60 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Next, let's calculate the total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Finally, we add the total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons.

First, we need to find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, the total revenue per gallon is:
20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon

Since they made a profit of $25, their total revenue is the sum of the profit and the cost. Let's call the total cost 'x'. Then, the total revenue is:
Total revenue = Profit + Cost
Total revenue = $25 + x

Since they sell each gallon for $10, the number of gallons they sold is:
Total revenue = Number of gallons * $10/gallon
$25 + x = Number of gallons * $10/gallon

Now, let's solve for the number of gallons:
Number of gallons = ($25 + x) / $10

The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The cost of sugar per gallon is $2, so the cost of lemons per gallon is:
Cost of lemons per gallon = $5 - $2 = $3

The total cost of lemons is the cost of lemons per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:
Total cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of lemons = $3 * (($25 + x) / $10)

Since we are given that the total profit is $25, we can set up the equation:
Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$10 * Number of gallons - ($3 * Number of gallons) - ($2 * Number of gallons) = $25
$10 * (($25 + x) / $10) - $5 * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25

Simplifying the equation:
(10 - 5) * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
5 * (($25 + x) / $10) = $25
(25 + x) / 2 = $25
25 + x = $50
x = $25

Now that we have the total cost, we can find the cost of lemons:
Total cost = $25
Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
Total cost of lemons = $25

The final answer is: $25"

Chinese participants = 160

Since the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

"Let's break down Zaid's expenses step by step.

First, Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. His monthly salary is 6000 dollars, so the amount spent on rent is 1/4 * 6000 = 600 dollars.

Next, he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. The amount spent on car fuel is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000 dollars.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel: 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 3400 dollars.

Zaid then donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. Half of 3400 is 1700, so he donates 1700 dollars to charity.

After the donation, the remaining amount is 3400 - 1700 = 1700 dollars.

Next, Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars for their weekly expenses and household goods. The total amount given to his family is 200 + 700 = 900 dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the amount Zaid has left: 1700 - 900 = 800 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations and 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write the equation 5x = 200.

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: 
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of red roses as 'y'. Then, y = 4x, and we know that x = 40. 
y = 4 * 40
y = 160

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can write an equation to represent the situation two years ago:
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * Jan's age two years ago + 5
Since Jan is 30, two years ago Jan was 28. 
Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * 28 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19

Now, we know Mark's age two years ago was 19. To find Mark's current age, we add 2 to this:
Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:
Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down the information given. We have two teams competing in a 4 by 400 meter relay. The well-rounded team has four members, each running their 400 meter leg in exactly 55 seconds. The less well-rounded team has a similar setup, but their first runner takes 60 seconds to complete their leg. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up. The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

Now, let's calculate the time for the less well-rounded team. Their first runner takes 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a six-sided die, which means there are 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The favorable outcomes for this are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 total outcomes, making the probability 3/6 or 1/2, which is equivalent to 50%.

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the die is rolled again, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2. Since these events are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row. 

50% - 25% = 25%

So, rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"

"Hello there. I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your question. 

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

We also know that there is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 70 pieces are given to the hamsters and the rabbits, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

The total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 90, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r, we can set up the equation 3r = 15. Solving for 'r', we get r = 5.

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to consider the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

"Let's break down the costs of the outing. The three friends spent $20.25 on tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, which means they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

The cost of the rides is $33 per ride, and they went on 2 different rides, so the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3. So, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

First, let's calculate the total pounds of insects the flock needs per week. Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week and there are 10 ducks, we multiply the pounds per duck by the number of ducks:

3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds

Now, let's divide the total pounds of insects per week by 7 to get the pounds of insects per day:

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help Violetta with her crayon purchase. 

To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color.

Total number of crayons she can buy = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons she can buy = 10

Now, to find out how much change she will get, we need to subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has.

Total cost of crayons = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total cost of crayons = 10 * $2
Total cost of crayons = $20

Change = Total money - Total cost of crayons
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. We can do this by multiplying the cost of a single pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total pounds of carrots distributed and subtract that from the initial amount.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, subtract the total pounds distributed from the initial amount:

Initial amount = 200 pounds
Total pounds distributed = 80 pounds
Pounds not used = Initial amount - Total pounds distributed = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds

The final answer is: 120"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you find out how many kids live in the city of Soda. To do that, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

First, let's list the given information:

- Total population: 23786
- Number of men: 8417
- Number of women: 9092

Now, let's calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of men and women from the total population.

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
= 23786 - 17509
= 6277

So, there are 6277 kids living in the city of Soda."
"Let's break down Elaine's Pokémon card collection. Initially, she had 20 cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, so she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Since Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

The total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.

The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"Let's break down John's situation. He wins an award with a $5000 monetary reward and a 5% raise in salary. His original weekly salary is $2000. 

First, we need to calculate the 5% raise:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = 100
New salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will have the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year. 

Now, let's calculate his total income for the year:
Total amount made that year = New salary * Number of weeks
= 2100 * 52
= 109200

The total amount John made that year is $109200."
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Josie's grape harvest. To find out how many barrels of wine her farm produces per year, we need to calculate the total tons of grapes produced and then multiply it by the number of barrels per ton.

First, let's find the total tons of grapes produced per year. Josie has a 10-acre farm, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. So, we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes per acre:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Now, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. To find the total number of barrels, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels per ton:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Let's break down Carl's cheese usage for the week. He ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used a total of 7 * 2 = 14 slices for his sandwiches.

For breakfast, Carl had cheese and egg omelets for 3 days. He used one more slice of cheese per omelet than per sandwich, which means he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for the 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for his omelets.

In addition to his sandwiches and omelets, Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that used 8 slices of cheese.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. To find the total number of pens she had initially, we add these two numbers together: 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Next, we need to find out how many pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the number of blue and red pens she bought: 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6 = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Total score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score of the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score of the remaining four tests, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests.

Total score of remaining four tests = 338 - 71 = 267

Since Brinley needs a total score of 558 for the semester, we need to find the score she needs on the sixth test. We subtract the total score of the remaining four tests from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267 = 291

The final answer is: 291"
"Hello there. Let's break down Michael's bike riding activities. He rode his bike at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks, covering a distance of 25 kilometers each time. 

First, we calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks:
25 kilometers * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 kilometers

After that, he decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week for 3 weeks, but for 60 kilometers each time. 
60 kilometers * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 kilometers

Now, let's add the total kilometers for both periods:
500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Joe's bag of Halloween candy contains 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and it's given that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

First, we need to find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Now, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn and subtract the amount she already has.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

The amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn is $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Day 1: 100 customers
- Day 2: 50 more customers than Day 1, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total by Day 3: 500 customers

To find the number of customers on Day 3, we need to subtract the total customers on Day 1 and Day 2 from the total by Day 3.

Customers on Day 3 = Total by Day 3 - (Customers on Day 1 + Customers on Day 2)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - (100 + 150)
Customers on Day 3 = 500 - 250
Customers on Day 3 = 250

"Let's dive into the problem. We have two pools, and both of them are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool four minutes ago is 2x gallons.

Since 4 minutes have passed, the total amount of water leaked from both pools is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The amount of water in the small pool now is x - 4 gallons (since 4 gallons leaked out). The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 4 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-4 = 2x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides:

12 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

6 = x

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water four minutes ago. The amount of water in the small pool now is 6 - 4 = 2 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. 

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Lori's hourly wage is $8.00. 

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then add 3 to each age.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Next, we find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3. Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now that we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63), we can calculate their ages in three years by adding 3 to each age: 
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Naomi scored 68 points in the board game. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. To find out how many points Yuri scored, we need to calculate half of Naomi's points first. Half of 68 is 34. 

Now, we add 10 to 34 to find out how many points Yuri scored. 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. To find out how many points Brianna scored, we add 17 to Naomi's points. 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now that we know how many points Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored, we can find out how many points Jojo scored. The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"Let's break down James' Pokémon card collection. He initially has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

First, we need to find the total number of cards he has. 
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90

Now, James loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 grass type cards. 
- Water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32
- Total cards = 90 - 8 = 82
- Grass type cards = 20 + 14 = 34
- Total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we use the formula: 
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after two weeks.

First, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. 30% of the total watermelons were ready, so we calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons.

Now, we need to find out how many watermelons were left after two months. We subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total number of watermelons.

120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Next, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so we calculate 3/4 of 84.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons.

Since there were half as many bugs as ants, we can find the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects.

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"Hello there. Let's figure out how many penguins are left sunbathing in the snow. We have a total of 36 penguins initially. 

One-third of them jump in the ocean, which is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner, which is also 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

In total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the sunbathing area. To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 
36 - 24 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total tomatoes he eats per week: 
6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. 
So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day. 
His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week. Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find the number of vines needed: 
63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's figure out how many pizzas John needs to order for his friends. 

First, we need to determine the total number of slices required. Since there are 20 friends and each friend should have 4 slices, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices per friend: 20 * 4 = 80.

Now, we know that pizzas are sold in slices of 8. To find out how many pizzas John needs, we divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza: 80 / 8 = 10.

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Ram buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low. He can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens. 

First, let's find out how many new pens he can make from the ink of the 25 pens he buys. To do this, we divide 25 by 5, which equals 5. This means he can make 5 new pens from the ink of the first 25 pens.

Now, he has 5 empty pens left. He can use the ink from these 5 pens to make 1 new pen.

So, the total number of pens he gets is 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens from the first 25 pens) + 1 (new pen from the 5 empty pens) = 31 pens.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Johnny starts with an initial amount of $20. He then adds an extra $10 to it, bringing the total to $30. 

Now, we need to find out how much this sum of money will be after it triples in a year. To do this, we multiply the current total by 3.

$30 * 3 = $90

So, after a year, Johnny will have $90."
"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's start by finding the ages of Mary and Joan. We know that Jessa is 20 years old. Since Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Now, we know that Mary is 2 years younger than Joan. So, Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we simply add their ages together: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the school hall. We know that 30% of the students went out through exit A. To find the number of students who left through exit A, we calculate 30% of 1000.

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left in the hall. We subtract the number of students who left through exit A from the total number of students.

Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

Next, we are told that 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find the number of students who left through exit B, we calculate 3/5 of 700.

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left in the hall after some students left through exit B. We subtract the number of students who left through exit B from the remaining students.

Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280

Finally, we need to find out how many students went out through exit C. Since the remaining students went out through exit C, we have our answer.

280 students went out through exit C.

The final answer is: 280"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. John has 54 candies.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.
3. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's break down the problem. Dolly has two books, and she reads her own two books and Pandora's one book. That's a total of 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books read by Dolly.

Pandora has one book and reads her own one book and Dolly's two books, which is a total of 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books read by Pandora.

So, in total, they read 3 books each. To find the collective total, we add the number of books read by Dolly and Pandora: 3 (Dolly) + 3 (Pandora) = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike has 5 pen pals initially, but he stops being pen pals with 2 of them. This leaves him with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Each of his remaining pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and since there are 3 of them, the total number of letters he receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week, which is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

In total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"Hello, I'd be happy to help you with Jason's phone plan. 

To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total minutes.

First, let's calculate the total minutes used for his daily calls: 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes. 

Next, we add the extra minutes he used: 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan: 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his plan."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Then, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, after Billy took his share, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two aquariums with snails and fish. One aquarium has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference in snails is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The equation based on the given information is 28 = 2(2x). To solve for x, we can start by simplifying the right side of the equation:

28 = 4x

Now, divide both sides by 4 to isolate x:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost for each day of makeup application. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and it takes 6 hours to do each day. So, the cost per day is $250 * 6 hours = $1500.

Since Jean needs the makeup done 4 times a week, the cost for 4 days a week is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so we multiply the weekly cost by 5 to get the total cost: $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, Jean gets a 10% discount on the total cost. To find the discount, we multiply $30,000 by 0.1: 0.1 * $30,000 = $3000.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid for Isabelle's little sister's birthday party, we need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies first.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cake, birthday presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, there are 3 people in total. 

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 / 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find the total cost of the onions, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. 
Total weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost per pound of onions is $1.50.

Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister.
- Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.
- Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
- Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies
- Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
- Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
- The difference in calories consumed = 9200 - 3600 = 5600

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that the school has 3 classes with 20 students in each class. So, the total number of students in the school is 20 * 3 = 60.

We are also given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school. This gives us 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33. 

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school. This gives us 30 - 33 = -3.

However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of students. This means that the given information is inconsistent.

But, if we assume that the given information is correct, then the number of boys in the third class is -3.

"Let's break down the information given: Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as x. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46.
The total number of cougars killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 
21 * 4 = 84.

Then, he bought 40 more cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide the total number of new cows by the number of stalls:

40 / 10 = 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

24 * 8 = 192

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section.

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from 8000 to find the final weight. 

30% of 8000 is 0.3 * 8000 = 2400. 

Now, we subtract 2400 from 8000: 8000 - 2400 = 5600.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then divide that by the number of cookies per cup of flour.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making: 66 / 12 = 5.5. 

Since 5.5 dozens is the same as 5 dozen and 6 cookies, we need to calculate the flour needed for 6 cookies. 6 cookies is half of a dozen, so we need half of 2 cups of flour, which is 1 cup.

Now, we need to add the flour needed for the remaining 5 dozen cookies. 5 dozen cookies need 5 * 2 = 10 cups of flour.

So, the total flour needed is 10 + 1 = 11 cups.

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to find the total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

We then subtract the total fees from the selling price to find the net selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, we subtract the remaining loan amount from the net selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to find the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

Let's say Mico's current age is M and Marco's current age is m. We know that the sum of their ages is 20, so we can write an equation: M + m = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10).

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: (M + m) + 20. Since we know that M + m = 20, we can substitute this into the expression to get 20 + 20 = 40.

However, we need to remember that we're adding 10 to each of their ages, so we need to add 20 to the sum of their current ages. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40 + 20 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which can be expressed as R = 6S, where R is Ruby's current age and S is Sam's current age.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, which can be expressed as (R + 9) = 3(S + 9).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

The total cost is $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots per cobra by 2 to find the number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we find half the total number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Maddy's pizza problem. 

To find out how much Maddy will spend, we need to calculate the total number of people she needs to buy pizza for. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 
The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"Hello there. I'm Fatima, a jewelry designer with a passion for creating beautiful pieces. I specialize in topaz necklaces, and I'd be happy to help you understand how I create them.

To make a topaz necklace, I use 8 topaz gemstones, each one inch long. I fill the space between these gemstones with sterling silver beads, which are one-quarter of an inch long. My necklaces are made to a total length of 25 inches.

First, let's calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, each one inch long, the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

Now, let's find the total length of the space between the gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them. The total length of these spaces is 7 * (1/4) = 7/4 = 1.75 inches.

To find the number of beads, we need to subtract the length taken up by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace and then divide the result by the length of each bead. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the length of the spaces is 25 - 8 = 17 inches. However, we already know that the length of the spaces is 1.75 inches. To find the number of beads, we need to divide the length of the spaces by the length of each bead: 1.75 / (1/4) = 1.75 / 0.25 = 7.

So, I use 7 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three family members: Alani, Braylen, and Margot. They each wrote a certain number of stories in the first week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. Her brother Braylen wrote 40 stories, and her sister Margot wrote 60 stories. 

To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we add the number of stories written by each of them: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. So, Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, we need to find the total number of stories written in the second week: 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week: 120 + 240 = 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years, we first need to determine his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his age by multiplying Ann's age by 2.

Ann's age is 9 years, so her brother's age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

In 3 years, her brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's calculate how many cents Kelly has initially. 

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 
Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

The total amount Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount she has. 

145 - 55 = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, let's first calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to find the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so we multiply the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone:

80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the trucks, which is 2000 pounds per truck:

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, and the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, the car in the slow lane is traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Given that the car in the fast lane (and the car in the slow lane) traveled 480 miles, we can calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane as follows:
time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, so the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let x be the total number of medals given out. Then, 10x = 39 (since Ali and Izzy have 39 medals together).

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.9}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. There are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get: 16 / 8 = 2.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Susan's earnings for the online task. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break in between, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

To find out how much she earns, we need to convert the time to minutes first. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the points of the three friends after the fourth round.

Mike initially has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 21 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point and still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point and now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed: 
Mike has 21 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43 = 82."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know the oldest son is 8 years old and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest. To find the youngest son's age, we divide the oldest son's age by 2: 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now, we know both sons' ages. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. In total, they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, we need to find out how many are left unwashed. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40

"To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household with 5 members who eat rice every lunch and dinner, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg).

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

To find the total number of crates sold, we add the crates sold each day: 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65.

Now, let's compare this to his target of 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target: 120 - 65 = 55.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carmen starts with a bid of $200, and each subsequent bid increases by $50. There are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them. This means there are 3 bids from the other people, and 3 bids from Carmen, making a total of 6 bids.

To find the total cost of the desk, we need to calculate the sum of these 6 bids. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 200, d = 50, and n = 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = (6/2) * (2*200 + (6-1)*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 5*50)
S = 3 * (400 + 250)
S = 3 * 650
S = 1950

The final answer is: $1950"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost for John's driving service.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total driving cost, and the total bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven. Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. 

Next, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he goes to work per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. Then, we multiply the weekly miles by the number of weeks he works per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Now, let's calculate the total driving cost. John is charged $2 per mile driven. So, the total driving cost per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

In addition to the driving cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus per year, we multiply the monthly bonus by 12: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Finally, we add the total driving cost and the total bonus to find the total cost per year: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes

Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, let's consider how the pages are arranged after folding.

When a piece of paper is folded, the front and back sides become the left and right sides of the folded paper.

For a 32-page tabloid, we can consider the following arrangement:

- The first page (page 1) is on the left back.
- The second page (page 2) is on the left front.
- The 32nd page is on the right back.
- The 31st page is on the right front.

This pattern continues until we reach the middle of the paper, where the 16th page is on the left back and the 15th page is on the left front.

After the middle, the pattern reverses, with the 17th page on the right back and the 16th page on right front.

Since each piece of paper can be folded in half to create two sides, we need two pieces of paper for the first 16 pages (left and right sides) and another two pieces of paper for the last 16 pages (left and right sides).

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2 (for the first 16 pages) + 2 (for the last 16 pages) = 4.

"Let's break down Annika's expenses at the town fair. She started with $50. 

First, she spent half of it on food and snacks. To find half of $50, we divide $50 by 2, which equals $25. 

Annika also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (on food and snacks) + $10 (on rides) = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

"Let's break down the information given:

Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at $20, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45.

To find the total amount of money she earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year. We can do this by subtracting the number of unsold books, the number of books sold this year, and the number of books sold in the first year from the total number of books.

Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:

Two-thirds of 60 is 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves sold in the afternoon.

"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 1/4 of the weight in the same amount of time as Joey, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds by 4. 

The number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds is 4. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we multiply 4 by 4: 4 * 4 = 16.

The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a serum that makes the drinker grow extra limbs at specific intervals. 

First, we need to figure out how many extra arms the person will grow. Since they grow an extra arm every 3 days, we divide the total number of days (15) by 3 to find out how many times this happens. 15 / 3 = 5, so they'll grow 5 extra arms.

Next, we need to calculate the number of extra legs. The person grows an extra leg every 5 days, so we divide the total number of days (15) by 5. 15 / 5 = 3, which means they'll grow 3 extra legs.

Now, we add the number of extra arms and legs together to find the total number of new limbs. 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

"Hello, I'd be happy to help you with Theo's business trip expenses. Let's break down the costs and see how much he has left for gifts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600. Then, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150. 

Next, we need to find the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the total cost so far: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

To find out how much Theo has left, we subtract the total cost from his initial budget: $6000 (initial budget) - $1950 (total cost so far) = $4050.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract this from his remaining budget: $4050 (remaining budget) - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050.

However, we need to find out how much he has left for gifts. Since he wants to save $2000, he has $2050 - $2000 = $50 left over, which he can spend on gifts.

Now, let's find out how many eggs the rest of the family members consume in a day. There are 5 - 3 = 2 family members who eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a day, we add the eggs eaten by both groups: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to multiply the daily consumption by 7 to find the total number of eggs consumed in a week: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. To find Jane's age, we subtract 3 from Quinn's age: 30 - 3 = 27.

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we add 5 to Jane's age: 27 + 5 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Hello, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

Now, we're given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that the football team has a total of 105 members. 

We're also told that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense. If we denote the number of players on the defense as D, then the number of players on the offense is 2D.

Additionally, we're informed that there are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense. So, the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: 2D + D + D/2.

To simplify this, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combining like terms, we get:

7D = 210

Now, let's solve for D by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:

D = 30

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Martha's Christmas party planning. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of people invited. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each.

2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

Now, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. We subtract those from the total number of people invited.
24 - 8 = 16 people

However, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. Since 1/4 of 8 is 2, we subtract those 2 people as well.
16 - 2 = 14 people

So, 14 people will show up for Martha's party.

The final answer is: 14"
"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Cost per cubic foot = $0.1
Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find out how many people left, we need to calculate 1/4 of 40, which is 40 * 1/4 = 10.

Since 10 people left, the number of people remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were 25 men initially, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 (because 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men).

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 x 8 = 24 pencils. She also has 2 loose pencils, so she has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

Number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= 72 / 8
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider the weakening caused by both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening caused by the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and we want to cool it down by 65 degrees. 

Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees (for simplicity). We want to cool it down to 35 degrees (100 - 65 = 35). 

The temperature difference is 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. So, the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since 5 ice cubes are added, the coffee becomes 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that 5 people came in with old records and left with 7 new records. Since they trade 2 old records for 1 new record, we need to find out how many old records they brought in.

Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the number of old records traded is twice the number of new records. 

Number of new records = 7
Number of old records traded = 2 * Number of new records
Number of old records traded = 2 * 7
Number of old records traded = 14

Since there are 5 people, and they all brought in the same number of old records, we can divide the total number of old records traded by 5 to find out how many old records each person brought in.

Number of old records per person = Number of old records traded / Number of people
Number of old records per person = 14 / 5
Number of old records per person = 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we can multiply the number of old records per person by the number of people to find the total number of old records.

Total number of old records = Number of old records per person * Number of people
Total number of old records = 2.8 * 5
Total number of old records = 14

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Hello, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. So, the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers. The salary of junior programmers is $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80000.

Next, let's find the salary of senior programmers. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so the salary of senior programmers is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers. The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144000.

Finally, let's find the total amount paid to all programmers. The total amount paid to all programmers is $80000 + $144000 = $208000.

The final answer is: $208000"

Now, we need to find out how many people were on the bus before the second bus stop. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off, so before that, there were 12 + 7 = 19 people on the bus.

We know that at the first bus stop, 5 people got in. So, before the first bus stop, there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus.

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"Let's break down Oscar's lollipop adventure step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. On his way to school, he eats 2, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes 14 out to his friends, which brings his total down to 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

After school, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, Oscar eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, bringing his total down to 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to charge 40%, we multiply 40 by 3.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"Let's break down the customer's shopping trip. They spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which means they earned $1 off for every $20 they spent. Since $80 is divisible by $20, they earned 4 rewards.

Now, let's move on to their current shopping trip. They spent $43 and used their rewards, which is $4 off the price. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

To find out how much the customer paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent: $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's break down the information given for the two job options.

For Job A, we know the hourly wage is $15 and the total hours worked per year is 2000. To find the total income, we multiply the hourly wage by the total hours worked: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year.

Since Job A is in a state with a 20% total tax rate, we need to calculate the income tax. The income tax is 20% of the total income, which is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. To find the net income, we subtract the income tax from the total income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, we know the total income is $42,000. However, there's a property tax of $6,000 and a 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax. First, we subtract the property tax from the total income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. This is the net income before tax. Then, we calculate the income tax, which is 10% of the net income before tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. To find the final net income, we subtract the income tax from the net income before tax: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, let's compare the net incomes of the two jobs. To find the difference, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"

"Let's break down the two offers from Furniture United and Cozy Homes to determine the cost difference.

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment. The total amount paid in installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment. The total amount paid in installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each. 

First, we need to find the price of the shares after the first year, when the stock price increases by 50%. To do this, we calculate 50% of the initial price and add it to the initial price. 50% of $8 is 0.5 * $8 = $4. So, the price of each share after the first year is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, we need to find the price of the shares after the second year, when the stock price decreases by 25%. To do this, we calculate 25% of the price after the first year and subtract it from the price after the first year. 25% of $12 is 0.25 * $12 = $3. So, the price of each share after the second year is $12 - $3 = $9.

Now, we can find the total value of all Maria's shares by multiplying the number of shares by the price of each share after the second year. The total number of shares is 8, and the price of each share after the second year is $9. Therefore, the total value of all Maria's shares is 8 * $9 = $72.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a class of 200 students that's split into 3 groups. Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two.

Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the last group has 10 fewer students, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. So, we can write the equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x: 
70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals on his farm, and they are all either chickens or cows. We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, we can write the equation H = 2C.

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write another equation: H + C = 60.

Now, we can substitute H in the second equation with 2C, resulting in 2C + C = 60. This simplifies to 3C = 60.

To find the value of C, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in C = 20.

Since H = 2C, we can find the value of H by multiplying C by 2, resulting in H = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80, and the total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

"Josh decides to take up juggling to perform at the school talent show a month in the future. He starts off practicing juggling 3 balls, and slowly gets better adding 1 ball to his juggling act each week. After the end of the fourth week, the talent show begins, but when Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops three of his balls. 2 of them are caught by people in the crowd as they roll off the stage, but one gets lost completely since the auditorium is dark.

To find out how many balls Josh has left, we need to calculate how many balls he had initially and then subtract the ones he lost. Josh had 3 balls initially and added 1 ball each week for 4 weeks, so he had 3 + 4 = 7 balls. When he dropped 3 balls, 2 were caught, so 1 ball was lost.

So, Josh starts juggling with 7 balls and loses 1, leaving him with 7 - 1 = 6 balls.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that a pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, a green toad, and that the yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog. We also know that the red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can determine the weights of the other animals as follows:

- The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of the animals and the container:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds

The amount they made per day when they made tractors is 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000 per day.

The amount they make per day now is 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount they make per day now and the amount they made per day when they made tractors is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they made tractors.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total cost per month and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the cost of food per month: 
Food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so the food cost per month is $25 * 4 = $100.

Now, let's add the cost of treats and medicine to the food cost:
Treats cost $20 per month, and medicine costs $100 per month. 
Total cost per month = $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine)
Total cost per month = $220

Now, let's multiply the total cost per month by 12 to get the total cost per year:
Total cost per year = Total cost per month * 12
Total cost per year = $220 * 12
Total cost per year = $2640

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find the total time for Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them up.

Let's start with Monday's yoga class, which is 1 hour long. On Tuesday, Peyton has a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga, so that's 3 hours. On Wednesday, there's a half-hour cheese-tasting event. On Thursday, the museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class, which is 1.5 hours. Finally, on Friday, Peyton has 2 hours of errands.

Now, let's add up the time for all activities:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help April figure out how many plant pots she has left over.

To do this, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs. April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. She also needs twice as many for the roses, which is 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots.

So, the total number of plant pots she needs is 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Andrea started with $36. She spent $11 on a sweater, so she had $36 - $11 = $25 left. Then, she gave her brother $4, leaving her with $25 - $4 = $21.

To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she had after spending and giving her brother money from the initial amount.

Initial amount: $36
Amount after saving: $21

Amount saved = Initial amount - Amount after saving
Amount saved = $36 - $21
Amount saved = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down John's activities. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. He also watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We know that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. If 30% of the total time is 6 hours, we can find the total time by dividing 6 by 0.30. That gives us 20 hours.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying 0.40 by the total time: 0.40 * 20 = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down Annabelle's situation. She's saving for a phone that costs $400 and already has $80 in her savings. To find out how much more she needs, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work:
$10/hour * 20 hours = $200

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work:
$5/hour * 15 hours = $75

Total earnings from both jobs: $200 + $75 = $275

Now, let's subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs:
$400 - $275 = $125

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $125"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Now, let's find the combined height of the two shorter trees. We add their heights together: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. So, we multiply the combined height by 2: 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's break down Dean's expenses and the extra money his mother gave him. 

First, we need to find out how much Dean spent on toy cars. Since each toy car costs $2 and he bought 6 of them, the total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, we need to find out how much Dean spent on teddy bears. Each teddy bear costs $1, and he bought 5 of them, so the total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears to find the total amount Dean spent: $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially received $28 from his mother, and then she gave him an extra $10. So, the total amount of money Dean has now is $28 + $10 = $38.

To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he has: $38 - $17 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
The cost of arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. 

Since Morgan's dad has a budget of $90, we subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$90 - $30 = $60.

Since Morgan will also be playing, we need to subtract her cost from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 
$60 - $5 = $55.

Now, we know that each friend will cost $30 (mini-golf + go-karts). 
To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $30 = 1.83

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
1.83 ≈ 1

However, this is incorrect because we forgot to include the arcade tokens in the cost per friend. The cost per friend is actually $30 + $5 = $35. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend. 
$55 / $35 = 1.57

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Marisa's savings problem.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day from her parents. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each every day and saves the change in her piggy bank. To find out how much money she puts in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days, we need to calculate her daily savings first.

The cost of 4 lollipops is 4 x $0.25 = $1. Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day.
Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Cost of lollipops
Daily savings = $5 - $1
Daily savings = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days.
Total savings = Daily savings x Number of days
Total savings = $4 x 5
Total savings = $20

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Billy starts with $10 that his father gave him. He buys some candy at $1.5 per pound, and then he spends half of his change on gumballs that cost $0.05 each. We know he bought 40 gumballs.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the total cost of 40 gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Now, we know that Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs. This means the amount he spent on gumballs is half of the change he had after buying the candy. Let's call the amount of candy he bought 'x' pounds. The cost of the candy is $1.5x.

The amount of money Billy had left after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x. Since he took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs, we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's solve the problem. We are given that Carver is 45 years old, and his age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this as an equation:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the distance from the third city to the first city. To do this, we add the distances from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city, then subtract 50 miles.

Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Combined distance: 75 + 100 = 175 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance traveled in one trip. 
Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 125 miles
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is:
Total distance in one trip: 300 miles
Total trips in a day: 3
Total distance in a day: 300 * 3 = 900 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days between services, we need to divide the total distance between services by the total distance traveled in a day.
Total distance between services: 18,000 miles
Total distance in a day: 900 miles
Number of days between services: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we need to find the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average is calculated by adding the two values and dividing by 2. 
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 
Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Total stuffing needed = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip separately.

First, let's find the time taken to drive to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. 

Time taken to drive to friend's house = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.857 hours (approximately).

However, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance to his friend's house is 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles. 

Time taken to drive to friend's house with detour = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Next, let's find the time taken to drive back home. The distance back home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph.

Time taken to drive back home = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Now, we can find the total time taken for the trip by adding the time taken to drive to his friend's house and the time taken to drive back home.

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to friend's house + Time taken to drive back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"Let's break down the information given:

3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. 

A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
S = 4 * 3 - 5
S = 12 - 5
S = 7

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
V = 3 * S
V = 3 * 7
V = 21

If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we need to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. 
Let's denote the number of people kicked out for other reasons as O. 
The total number of people kicked out is the sum of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons.
3 + 7 + 21 + O = 50
31 + O = 50
O = 50 - 31
O = 19

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's start with the picture frames. Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20. Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to consider the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost, which is 20% of $20, or $4 per frame. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's add the cost of the picture frames and the etching together: $880 + $176 = $1056.

In addition to the picture frames and etching, 2 seniors will also receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Lastly, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 of 44, or 11 seniors. These officers will receive cords that cost $12 each. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

To find the total cost of all the gifts, we add the cost of the picture frames and etching, the cost of the pins, and the cost of the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since making it yourself saves 20%, that means you save 20% of $400. 
20% of $400 = 0.2 * $400 = $80

So, the materials cost is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"Let's break down the shoe sale. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double that number of shoes, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold:
50 * 2 = 100

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, she can make a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of the supplies is $18. To find the total profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

"Let's solve the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. This means he has 2/5 of his land remaining.

To find the initial amount of land, we can set up an equation: (2/5)x = 12.8, where x is the initial amount of land.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% for bundling. To find the bundled cost, we need to calculate 20% of $20 (the normal cost of both services). 

20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before his jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete

However, since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the steps he had left to complete before his jog.

4,000 (steps left to complete) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's find out how many minutes it will take Toby to read the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and it averages 200 words per page, we can calculate the total number of words in the book.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Now, we can find the time it will take Toby to read the book by dividing the total number of words by his reading rate of 300 words per minute.

Time to read the book = Total words / reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time Toby will be at the airport is 30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes.

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we can find out how many minutes early he will be by subtracting the time he arrives from the time he has to be there.

Time early = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"Hello, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

$168,000"
"Let's break down Sally's expenses at the seashore. She bought 2 pounds of taffy, which is a special deal where one pound costs $3 and the other pound is half off. So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

In addition to the taffy, Sally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up all of Sally's expenses: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract her total expenses from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"I'd be happy to help you calculate the total amount Tim spent on fireworks.

First, let's find the total cost of the fireworks. The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the discount. Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, so the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Next, we need to add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150.

The total amount spent is $960 (fireworks) + $150 (finale firework) = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply 2 by 30 to find the total number of cookies she will eat:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Now, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies her recipe makes, which is 1 dozen (12 cookies). To find out how many dozens she needs, we divide 60 by 12:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the conditions given. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500.

However, the problem also states that these candles are part of the 1% of candles that are more dangerous and can explode. This means that the 2500 candles that smell like wet dog are a subset of the 1% of candles that can explode. To find the total number of candles that can explode, we need to find 1% of 50000, which is 0.01 * 50000 = 500.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog, we can find this by multiplying 5% by the number of candles that can explode: 0.05 * 500 = 25.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first calculate the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The average trees are not specified, so let's call the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x:
45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"As-salamu alaykum, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a herd consisting of camels and dromedaries. We know that there are 180 heads and 304 bumps in total. Camels have two humps each, while dromedaries have one hump each.

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We can write two equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, so we have: C + D = 180
2. The total number of bumps is 304, so we have: 2C + D = 304

Now, let's solve these equations to find the number of dromedaries. We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"Let's break down Tom's trip into manageable parts. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

Next, we need to find 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is (30/100) * 800 km = 240 km. This means Tom traveled 240 km in the next 2 days.

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches (Zack's locker size)

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. To find Timothy's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2.

2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches (Timothy's locker size)

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and his comb fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below. To find the elevation where the comb landed, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation.

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

To find the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. To find the total number of cats taken away, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat carried: 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats on the rock: 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran from the remaining cats to find the number of cats left on the rock: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different price periods and calculate the cost for each period.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first 6 months at $8 a month:
6 months * $8/month = $48

Next, we'll calculate the cost for the next 8 months at $12 a month:
8 months * $12/month = $96

Then, we'll calculate the cost for the remaining months at $14 a month. Since 2 years is equal to 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, the remaining months are:
24 months - 6 months - 8 months = 10 months
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as T and the jogger jeans as J. We can write the equation: J = T - 6.

Next, we're told that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can write the equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Now, let's substitute J from the first equation into the second equation: (1/3)(T - 6) + (2/3)T = 6.

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: T - 6 + 2T = 18.

Combining like terms, we get: 3T - 6 = 18.

Adding 6 to both sides, we get: 3T = 24.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: T = 8.

Now that we know the cost of the tattered jeans, we can find the cost of the jogger jeans: J = T - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2.

The jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $2"

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Lillian's bird feeder problem. 

Let's break it down step by step. Lillian made 3 bird feeders, and each of these attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Since the store-bought ones attract 20 birds, the homemade ones attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

She bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these attracts 20 birds. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Kenny wants to buy a ticket to an amusement park that costs $100. He has $50 in spending cash, so he needs to make $50 from selling his Pokémon cards. Each card is sold for $1.5.

To find out how many cards he needs to sell, we can divide the amount he needs ($50) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5
Number of cards sold = 33.33 (round down to 33 since you can't sell a fraction of a card)

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Then, 2/3 * x = 33.33

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to determine how many hotdogs were prepared. The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests were prepared for to have two hotdogs. This means 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests. 

However, the caterer prepared enough for the other half of the guests (also 18) to have one hotdog each. So, 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests. 

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were needed. 

Since there were only 54 hotdogs prepared, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. This means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Charlotte's shopping problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. Charlotte wants a set of pot and pans for $120.00, a set of mixing bowls for $20.00, and 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each. 

The total cost of the utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00. Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The clerk told Charlotte that everything is 20% off. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte needs to pay: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas was in one container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8. 

3 * 8 = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. 

1/4 * 3 = 0.75 gallons

Now we convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 0.75 by 8.

0.75 * 8 = 6 pints

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money George spent on chips. Since he bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, the total cost of the chips is 3 * 40 cents = $1.20.

Now, we know that George spent a total of $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his money, which is equal to $4.99.

The amount of money George spent on candy bars is the difference between the total money spent and the money spent on chips, which is $4.99 - $1.20 = $3.79.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find the number of candy bars George bought by dividing the total money spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: $3.79 / 0.75 = 5.0533.

Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 5 candy bars.

25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept) = 20 lollipops shared

Now, we need to divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends. Ray has 4 friends, so we'll divide 20 by 4.

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rory makes a cake that weighs 20 ounces and cuts it into 8 equal pieces. Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find out how much cake is left.

First, we need to find the weight of each piece. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Now, we know that Rory and her mom each have a piece, so we need to find the total weight of the cake they ate. Since they each had one piece, the total weight eaten is equal to the weight of two pieces.

Total weight eaten = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight eaten = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight eaten = 5 ounces

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the total weight eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Total weight eaten
Weight of remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of remaining cake = 15 ounces

"To find the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's. So, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time difference between their arrival times.

To do this, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then add 5 minutes to it. Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, and she needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.

However, since Bernadette needs to leave before Wayne, we need to subtract the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater from the time Bernadette needs to leave. So, Bernadette needs to leave 21 - 4 = 17 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:
Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out how many beads each sister has and then determine the difference between their total bead counts.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

"Hello there. Let's break down the situation with Marcus and his house. 

Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and his oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's consider the effect of the open window. Marcus opens it for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. For 30 minutes, it cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

To find the final temperature, we add the initial temperature to the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the open window. So, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"Let's break down the information given about the triathlon. We know that Jon's times for the swim, bike, and run are 40 minutes, 80 minutes, and 50 minutes, respectively. 

To find James' total time, we need to consider the changes in his times compared to Jon's. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so his swim time is 40 - (40 * 0.1) = 36 minutes. He takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find James' total time. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes. 

To find James' run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how far the horse runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"I'd be happy to help Rozanne figure out how many trays of eggnog she can make. 

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She has 4 dozen eggs in cases, which is 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. Then, she also has 2 loose eggs in the cupboard. So, in total, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses Rozanne can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the total number of trays Rozanne can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the situation. Joey starts with 214 points and scores 26 points. To find his new total, we add these two numbers together.

Joey's initial points: 214
Points scored by Joey: 26
Joey's total points after his turn: 214 + 26 = 240

Next, we look at Marcy's situation. She starts with 225 points and scores 10 points. We add these two numbers together to find her new total.

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10
Marcy's total points after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's total points and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning.

Difference: 240 - 235 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The final answer is: $539"

"Let's break down the information given:

You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?

Let's analyze the situation: If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda for $3, the total cost is $15. If you buy the super ticket for $20 and save $2, the total cost is $18. The difference between the two scenarios is $18 - $15 = $3.

This $3 difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket. Since the super ticket includes the popcorn for $1 extra, the regular price of the popcorn is $3 - $1 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total cost of filling 20 helium balloons was $900. To find the cost of filling one balloon, we need to divide the total cost by the number of balloons: 900 / 20 = 45.

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. Multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11050.

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance1 = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles
Distance2 = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles
Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one bed is length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to find the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

The total number of cards is the sum of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"Let's break down the situation. Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest. After about twenty minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined the group.

So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 

To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total number of fairies. 

75 - 30 = 45

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 

Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and divide it by the truck's capacity.

First, let's calculate the weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips, we'll divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 3400 / 2250
= 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Grayson's recycling earnings. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. 

Aluminum cans are worth two cents each, so three cans are worth 3 * 2 = 6 cents. 

Plastic bottles are worth three cents each, so five bottles are worth 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

To find her weekly earnings, we add the value of the cans and bottles: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

Since there are four weeks in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Frederick has 10 plants. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:
Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has:
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Each student gets 10 cards, so the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much Becky paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents. Since there's a $1 discount, we subtract 100 cents from the total cost: 900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 800 cents / 100 = $8.

Next, we need to find out how much Kelly paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents. Since there's a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of 1000 cents. To do this, we multiply 1000 cents by 0.1: 0.1 * 1000 cents = 100 cents. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: 1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 900 cents / 100 = $9.

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. We do this by subtracting Becky's total cost from Kelly's total cost: $9 - $8 = $1.

"Let's break down the problem. Matt's dad tells him that he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of carrot sticks he needs to eat.

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks as 'x'. The number of cookies Matt can have is half of 'x' plus 2. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have the chance to eat 5 cookies."

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we need to divide the total number of days by 4 to find out how many days he has to walk each week.

21 days / 4 days/week = 5.25 weeks * 4 days/week = 21 days, but we need to find out how many days he has to walk each day. 

To find out how many days he has to walk each day, we need to divide the total number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week) and then multiply by 4 (since he can walk 4 days a week).

21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks
3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

However, we need to find out how many days he has to walk each day. To do this, we need to divide the total number of days by 4 (since he can walk 4 days a week).

12 days / 4 days/week = 3 days

"Let's break down the problem. Gabriel has 20 songs on his portable media player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Since the player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs to his player. Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs to his player.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add, we need to subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add. So, 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. They picked a total of 60 oranges, and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. 

To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 2 by 60 and then divide by 5. 
2 * 60 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Now, we need to find out how much money he gave up. He gave up $10 for each orange he ate, so we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.
24 * $10 = $240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first find out how many miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. 
So, miles run in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles run in a week by his speed.

Hours run in a week = Total miles run in a week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

The final answer is: 6"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Uncle Ben's oats problem. 

To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is 200 / 50 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add the temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48°F, in Northlandia is 21°F, and in Midlandia is -3°F.

First, add the temperatures: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Then, divide the sum by 3: -30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F."
"Let's calculate how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount of money to buy the toy car.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 savings. To find the remaining amount, we subtract the amount already saved from the total cost.

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount already saved
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount.

Daily savings = $2
Days to save the remaining amount = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Days to save the remaining amount = $8 / $2
Days to save the remaining amount = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money to buy the toy car."
"Let's break down the problem. Jaime has 2 trays, and each tray can hold 24 eggs. To find out how many eggs he can place on the trays, we multiply the number of trays by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Now, we need to find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the trays. We do this by subtracting the number of eggs that can fit from the total number of eggs he has.

64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the trays.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Heather buys razors that come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. They are currently on sale for buy one get one free, which means she only pays for half the number of packs she buys. She also has a $2.00 coupon.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale. Since she only pays for half the number of packs, she pays for 1 pack, which is $4.00.

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost. The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, she walks 5 * 8 = 40 minutes every day.

She worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how old Brett will be in four years. Since he's 14 years old now, we add 4 to his current age: 14 + 4 = 18.

Now, we know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, we multiply Brett's current age by 3: 14 * 3 = 42.

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is now, we subtract 4 from 42: 42 - 4 = 38.

So, Angela is currently 38 years old."
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is 14 days * $6 per day = $84.

The cost of the afternoon rides is 14 days * $2 per day = $28.

The total cost is $84 + $28 = $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so she has a total of 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, which means she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Now, let's add the total number of oranges they have together: 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can calculate the total number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by 3: 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem. Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends. However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). The cost of the second venue is $25x (per person charge).

We can set up the equation: 200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides: 200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20: 10 = x

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, the number of insects David found is B/2. 

We can express the number of insects Lily found as B/2 + 7, since she found 7 more than David.

The total number of insects they collected is the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi, which is 43. So, we can write the equation as: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms: B + B = 2B, and 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the equation becomes: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. To find the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we need to calculate the yards used by each of them separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the yards used by Mariah. She used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we can multiply 364 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 364 by 4.

364 ÷ 4 = 91 yards

Now, let's find the yards used by Mariah's grandma. She used 1/2 of a skein of yarn, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/2 of 364, we can multiply 364 by 1/2, which is the same as dividing 364 by 2.

364 ÷ 2 = 182 yards

Now that we have the yards used by Mariah and her grandma, we can add them together to find the total yards used.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

2 friends want 5 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 2 * 5 = 10.
3 friends want 2 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 3 * 2 = 6.
The total number of gifts for all friends is 10 + 6 = 16.
Adding the 10 random gifts, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 16 + 10 = 26.

"Hello there. Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the chair is 3 feet wide. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, we can calculate its width by adding 5 to the chair's width. 

Rug's width = chair's width + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Now, we need to find the length of the couch. It's mentioned that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. To find twice the width of the rug, we multiply the rug's width by 2.

Twice the rug's width = 2 * 8 = 16 feet.

Now, we add 2 feet to this to find the couch's length.

Couch's length = 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"Let's break down the information given: Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She got 2 packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, we need to find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost.

Let's denote the cost of each strawberry pack as 'x'. Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is 2x.

The total cost of the grape gum is $2, and the total cost of the green apple gum is $1. So, the total cost of all the gum is 2x + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2x.

Since the total cost is $7, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 7.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, 2x = 4.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 4 / 2, x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find out which type of wood gives the most popsicle sticks per dollar. 

A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and gives 200 sticks, so the number of sticks per dollar is 200 / 4 = 50.
A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and gives 400 sticks, so the number of sticks per dollar is 400 / 6 = 66.67 (round down to 66.67 since we can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood).

Since 66.67 is greater than 50, the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood I can buy with my $24 budget: 24 / 6 = 4.

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives 400 sticks, 4 pieces of wood will give 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first find the total number of snowshoes needed. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24. Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes needed is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find out how much Janet saves by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips in a week and then subtract that from the cost of the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips in a week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total weekly cost of bus trips is 10 * $2.20 = $22.00.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of a weekly bus pass, which is $20. 

The amount Janet saves by buying a weekly bus pass is $22.00 - $20 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Hello there. Let's break down the information given. The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has 20 sheep. Now, we know the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, which means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows. 

Next, we're told the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, which makes a total of 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, which makes a total of 80 animals.

To find the total number of animals, we add the number of animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

Let's break down the problem. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since she bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up an equation to find out how many Sophia bought.

Let's say Sophia bought 'x' onions and 'y' potatoes. Then, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is x + y. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:
x + y = 4(x + y)

We also know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. We can set up another equation using this information:
12 + 4 = 4x + 4y

Simplifying the equation:
16 = 4x + 4y

Divide both sides by 4:
4 = x + y

Now, we need to find the values of x and y. Since we know that x + y = 4, we can set up the equation as:
x + y = 4

We also know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Let's try to find the values of x and y that satisfy the equation x + y = 4.

If Sophia bought 0 onions, then y = 4. Substituting this value in the equation x + y = 4, we get:
x + 4 = 4
x = 0

So, Sophia bought 0 onions and 4 potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day to reach his goal, we first need to find out how many days he has to lose the weight. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 171 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 
105,000 / 171 ≈ 613.5 calories per day.

"Let's break down Julie's expenses step by step.

First, Julie spent 20% of her initial $500 on clothes. To find 20% of $500, we multiply 0.2 by $500, which equals $100. So, she spent $100 on clothes.

Now, we subtract $100 from the initial $500 to find the remaining money: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find 25% of $400, we multiply 0.25 by $400, which equals $100. So, she spent $100 on CDs.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know that the house cost three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 
He has 4 $10 bills, so the total money from these bills is 4 * $10 = $40.
He also has 6 $20 bills, so the total money from these bills is 6 * $20 = $120.
The total money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Next, Ali gives his sister half of the total money. Half of the total money is $160 / 2 = $80. 
After giving his sister half, Ali has $160 - $80 = $80 left.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of the remaining money, we multiply $80 by 3/5, which is (3/5) * $80 = $48.
After buying dinner, Ali has $80 - $48 = $32 left.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the Beverly Hills Bakery has left, we need to calculate the total number of loaves sold and then subtract that from the initial number of loaves baked.

First, let's find the total number of loaves sold. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. 

Total loaves sold = 93 + 39 = 132

Now, we need to subtract the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves sold. The grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves.

Total loaves left = Total loaves baked - Total loaves sold - Loaves returned
Total loaves left = 200 - 132 - 6
Total loaves left = 62

The number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with Jackson's tulip problem. 

To find the number of rows of red tulips, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6
Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8
Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. 

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of cookies.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be used for the granola and snack mix. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of them will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Now, let's find out how many cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies. The total number of cups of raisins is 27, and 9 cups will be used for the granola and snack mix. So, 27 - 9 = 18 cups of raisins will be left for the oatmeal cookies.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins left for the oatmeal cookies by 3/4 to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make.

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then multiply it by the cost per kilowatt hour.

Daily consumption before adding the device is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Weekly consumption before adding the device is 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour.
Cost before adding the device is 84 * $1.50 = $126.

Daily consumption after adding the device is 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.
Weekly consumption after adding the device is 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour.
Cost after adding the device is 98 * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we need to find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

Since 5 people can work together, their combined work rate is 5 times that of one person. Therefore, 5 people can paint half a house in 5 / 5 = 1 day.

Now, if 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days (because 2 * 0.5 = 1).

To convert the time from days to hours, we multiply the number of days by 24. So, 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set, spending a total of $48. To find out how many more CDs he could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to first determine how much money he spent on the headphone set.

The money spent on the headphone set can be found by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount spent. 

Money spent on the headphone set = Total money spent - Money spent on the CD
Money spent on the headphone set = $48 - $4
Money spent on the headphone set = $44

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Number of CDs that could have been bought = Money spent on the headphone set / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought = $44 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 11

Next, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set and the CD.

Number of CDs that could have been bought = Total money / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs that could have been bought = $48 / $4
Number of CDs that could have been bought = 12

Now, let's find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = Number of CDs that could have been bought - Number of CDs that could have been bought
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 11 - 1
Number of CDs that could have been bought without the headphone set = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours, the weeks where he spent 5 hours, and the week where he spent 6 hours.

For the weeks where he spent 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (since 8 - 2 = 6). 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks where he spent 5 hours, there are 2 weeks.
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week where he spent 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add up the total hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Now, let's figure out how many passengers get on at the second stop. It says 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 3 times the number of passengers who got off (21) fewer passengers get on. 3 times 21 is 63, so 63 fewer passengers get on. Since we are looking for the number of passengers who get on, we need to subtract 63 from the number of passengers who got off, which is 21. However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This means that 63 more passengers got on.

So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122.

The final answer is: 122"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age:
   Difference = Jame's current age - cousin's current age
             = 22 - 47
             = -25

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference:
   Difference = | -25 |
             = 25

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer = $2,400
2. Cost of the computer = $1,100
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, we need to find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there are 20 kids in total, and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys went out for the scavenger hunt and brought back 60 shells each. To find the total number of seashells brought by the boys, we multiply the number of boys by the number of shells each boy brought: 10 * 60 = 600.

Now, we need to find the number of seashells brought by the girls. The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 (the number of shells brought by the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times the number of shells brought by the boys) seashells.

First, let's calculate four times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Now, we add the number of shells brought by the boys to this result: 60 + 240 = 300.

So, the girls brought 300 more seashells than the boys. To find the total number of seashells brought by the girls, we add this to the total number of seashells brought by the boys: 600 + 300 = 900.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls to find the number of seashells brought by each girl: 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Nick had twice as many candies as George. If we let the number of candies George had initially be x, then Nick had 2x candies initially.

Now, George ate 5 candies, so he has x - 5 candies left. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation x - 5 = 3.

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation, which gives us x = 8.

Since Nick had 2x candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick has by multiplying 2 and 8, which gives us 2 * 8 = 16.

So, Nick has 16 candies."
"Hi there, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you figure out Anne's age.

To find Anne's age, we need to find Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we subtract 4 from Chenny's age to get Alyana's age.

Chenny is 10 years old, so Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6.

Now, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we add 2 to Alyana's age to get Anne's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 = 81
81 + 45 = 126
126 + 62 = 188

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find his initial share. $18 / 3 = $6.

Next, he added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

Then, he added another $10, so he had $11 + $10 = $21.

After that, he spent $8 from his total, so he had $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he had $13 * 3 = $39.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we need to determine the amount he saves each day in the first half and then double it.

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's denote the amount saved in the first half as y. Then, the amount saved in the second half will be 2y.

The total amount saved in the first half is xy, and the total amount saved in the second half is 2xy.

The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we can set up the equation: 3xy = 1125.

Since x is the number of days in the first half, and the total number of days in April is 30, we can write x + (30 - x) = 30, which simplifies to 30 = 30, and this equation is true for any value of x. However, we know that x cannot be 0 or 30, so we can assume x = 15.

Now we can substitute x = 15 into the equation 3xy = 1125 to find y: 3(15)y = 1125, which simplifies to 45y = 1125.

To find y, we divide both sides by 45: y = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount saved in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"Let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Verna bought. She purchased three apples at $1.50 each, five oranges at $0.80 each, and six peaches at $0.75 each.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jairus gets $0.8 for each task he completes, and Jenny gets $0.5 for each task she completes. Both of them finished 20 tasks.

To find out how much Jairus will get in total, we multiply the amount he gets per task by the number of tasks he completed: 0.8 * 20 = $16.

Similarly, to find out how much Jenny will get in total, we multiply the amount she gets per task by the number of tasks she completed: 0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jairus' total and Jenny's total to see how much more Jairus will get than Jenny. The difference is $16 - $10 = $6.

"Let's break down the problem. Jeff and Brad are trying to divide 100 dollars between them, and Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's denote the amount Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so the sum of what Jeff and Brad get is 100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"

"Let's break down Elise's writing process step by step. 

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 letters.

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters from the first two times and the 13 letters from the third time. So, she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters. So, the total number of letters she has written is 65 + 65 = 130.

Now, we're told that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's. This means Jonathan needs 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". We can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. To find the size of Zack's locker, we need to find half of Timothy's locker size. 

Zack's locker size = 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.

Now, we need to find the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To do this, we'll divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size = 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and her husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. 

Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. 
Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.
Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

We are given that the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4. 
So, x = 4.

Now, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake:
Juan drinks 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups of coffee.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of hamsters. There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters in each cage, so we multiply 3 by 10 to get the total number of hamsters: 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters.

Next, we find the number of guinea pigs. There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs in each cage, so we multiply 3 by 5 to get the total number of guinea pigs: 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together to get the total number of rodents: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we need to find their total weight and divide it by 3.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

The total weight of the 3 friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

The average weight of the 3 friends is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the angle the sun moves. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.

The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours. To find the total angle moved by the sun, we multiply the angle moved per hour by the number of hours:

Angle moved by the sun = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Now, we add the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle moved by the sun to find the final angle from the ground to the sun:

Final angle from the ground to the sun = Initial angle + Angle moved by the sun
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we need to determine the total number of candles he needs. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are one per year of age, so James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the total pages she read in the first week and then add it to the pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 105 / 1.5 = 70.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. To do this, we need to calculate a third of 12. A third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.

Next, we need to find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate. To do this, we need to calculate a quarter of 12. A quarter of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

Now, we need to find out how many sandwiches are left. Cody and Trevor ate a total of 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

So, the number of sandwiches left is 12 - 7 = 5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew. 

Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as x. 

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7. 

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 
First, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = x + 7.
This simplifies to 17 = x + 7.

Next, we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 17 - 7 = x.
This simplifies to x = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00, so the total for these teeth is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

We know that Richie scored 80 goals. We also know that he scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna.

To find out how many goals Mark scored, we subtract 20 from Richie's total: 80 - 20 = 60.

To find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 45 from Richie's total: 80 - 45 = 35.

Now, let's add up the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"Let's break down the problem. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so we need to find the total amount of money he made. To do that, we multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade: 21 * 4 = $84.

Now, we know Liam made $63 that weekend. To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings: 84 - 63 = 21.

"Let's break down Peter's action figure purchases. He has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. 

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. This is a total of 4 days, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 * $5 = $20. Since he spent $20, he bought 20 / 5 = 4 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $70 - $20 = $50 left. He has 5 days left, so the total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 50 / 2 = 25.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to first calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses ordered per week is: 
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is: 
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

"To find the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost. The bread costs $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. The cheese and condiments cost $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need to buy 1 set of cheese and condiments.

Total cost = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.

Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

To make a muffin crayon, Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together. To find out how many muffin crayons she can make, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8. 

192 / 8 = 24

So, Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. Since each muffin crayon sells for $1.50, Kate can make 24 * $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and the cost of the materials and labor.

The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of the materials is $2592 + $432 + $864 = $3888.

The total cost of the labor is $864 + $7344 = $8208.

The total cost to replace the carpet is $3888 + $8208 = $12196.

First, we start with a value of 20. 

Next, we need to find half of this value, which is 20 / 2 = 10.

Now, we add the starting value to half of the value, so 20 + 10 = 30.

Then, we divide the resulting value by 5, which gives us 30 / 5 = 6.

Finally, we multiply the resulting value by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."

"To find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we need to determine the percentage by which it's off. The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18. 

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to find the temperature she should set the oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. To do this, we'll find 4% of 520 and subtract it from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The temperature she should set the oven to is 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature she should set the oven to is 499.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

Herb's house price is $76,000. To find 30% of this, we multiply $76,000 by 0.3. 
0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800

Now, we subtract $22,800 from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price.
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

The value of Juan's house is $53,200. To find the combined value of the two houses, we add Herb's house price and Juan's house price together.
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total calories she burns from aerobics and running.

Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour, and she spends 2 hours doing it, so she burns 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics.

Running burns 600 calories per hour, and she spends 1 hour doing it, so she burns 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running.

The total calories burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units there are.

1600 / 200 = 8

Since each 200-calorie unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100.

8 * 100 = 800

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (since it's 1% fewer than blue jelly beans), and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B (since it's 1% more than blue jelly beans).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is 4500. So, we can write the equation:
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:
3.01B = 4500

Now, let's solve for B by dividing both sides by 3.01:
B = 4500 / 3.01
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given two different breakfast options for Martin: eating Cheerios every day or eating donuts every day. We need to find the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between these two options.

First, let's calculate the weight change for each option. If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds per week. If he eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds per week.

To find the total weight change after 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly weight change by 5.

Weight lost per week: -1.25 pounds
Weight gained per week: 1.75 pounds

Weight change after 5 weeks:
-1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds (lost)
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds (gained)

Now, we need to find the difference in weight between the two options. To do this, we subtract the weight gained from the weight lost.

Difference in weight: 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds

"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help Alex figure out how many seats she'll need for her event.

To start, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these invited people will also invite 2 of their friends, so we need to add 100 * 2 = 200 more people to the total count. This brings the total number of people invited via email to 100 + 200 = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 of her friends and 8 of them say they'll be bringing their spouses. This means we need to add 10 + 8 = 18 more people to the total count.

Now, let's add the people invited via email and the people invited by Alex's friends. 300 + 18 = 318. However, we still need to account for Alex herself, so we add 1 to the total.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we need to first determine how much protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. If we let Jerry's current age be 'x', we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600. To find the remaining amount he needs to pay, we subtract the deposit from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, let's calculate how many hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount. He makes $15 per hour at work. To find the number of hours, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a triangle, and we know that the sum of its three angles is 180 degrees. One angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle.

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it is 3x.

Now, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. 
One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's calculate how many gumballs Colby can buy. 

First, we need to convert all the coins into cents. 8 quarters equal 8 x 25 cents, which is 200 cents. 6 dimes equal 6 x 10 cents, which is 60 cents. 14 nickels equal 14 x 5 cents, which is 70 cents. And 15 pennies equal 15 x 1 cent, which is 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = Total amount of money / Cost of one gumball
= 345 cents / 5 cents
= 69

The final answer is: 69"
"Hello there. To find the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Adding 4 pounds to 8 pounds gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than this, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down Steve's game collection over the years. 

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 24 = 29 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 5 + 48 = 53 games in the third year.

Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

The additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. Since he makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, we can divide 120 by 2 to get the hourly rate. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates per hour for Ruiz.

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. It's given that she makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. 

To find Marissa's hourly rate, we multiply Ruiz's hourly rate by 3/4. 
60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds of chocolates per hour for Marissa.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"Let's break down Howard's spending at the arcade. On Monday, he spent $8. On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16. On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

To find the total amount he spent, we add these amounts together: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Since Howard originally had $100, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount to find out how much he has left: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down Patrick's lemonade sales. For the first four hours, he sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. To find the total amount earned in this period, we need to multiply the number of cups sold by the price per cup.

Total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total amount earned in 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. We'll calculate the total amount earned in this period similarly.

Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total amount earned in 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, we add the total amount earned in both periods to find the overall amount earned in 6 hours.

Total amount earned in 6 hours = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires can handle in a month and then divide that by the total number of rotations allowed.

First, let's find the number of rotations per month. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per 2 miles.

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/2 miles
Rotations per month = 290,000 rotations/month

Now, we can find the number of months the tires can last before they need to be replaced by dividing the total number of rotations allowed by the rotations per month.

Months before replacement = 10,440,000 rotations / 290,000 rotations/month
Months before replacement = 36 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the number of years by dividing the total months by 12.

Years before replacement = 36 months / 12 months/year
Years before replacement = 3 years

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the cost per pump of the shampoo, we need to first determine the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equal to 2400 cents. 

To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price, which is $25. To find 30% of $25, we multiply 0.3 by $25, which equals $7.5.

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt by subtracting the discount from the original price: $25 - $7.5 = $17.5.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the items. We add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.5 + $35 = $52.5.

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately. Now, let's find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase. We subtract the total cost from the amount Joe has: $50 - $52.5 = -$2.5.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this means Joe does not have enough money to buy the outfit.

The final answer is: -$2.5"
"To determine the amount of butter Juan needs to make croissants, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make. He plans to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, which has 7 days. 

First, we find the total number of croissants by multiplying the number of dozen croissants per day by the number of days:
4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, we multiply the total number of dozen croissants by 12 to get the total number of croissants:
28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we need to find the total amount of butter needed. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:
336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street: 194 * 490 = $95,060

To find how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to first find the cost to repave Monica's street and then subtract that from the cost to repave Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street: 194 * 150 = $29,100

Now, subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street: 
$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

"Let's break down the problem step by step. John initially receives $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. However, his research takes 10 times longer than expected, which means it lasts for 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The initial funding is for the first 5 months, so we need to calculate the funding for the remaining 45 months. The funding for each of these months is 50% more than the initial funding. To find the increased funding, we calculate 50% of $100,000, which is $50,000. Then, we add this to the initial funding to get $150,000 per month.

Now, we multiply the increased funding by the number of months it's applied to: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

To find the total cost of the research, we add the initial funding for the first 5 months to the cost for the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The final answer is: $6,850,000"

"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we first need to find the total number of seats. There are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row.

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Now, let's find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators.

Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

The remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the parents, we need to find one-third of the remaining seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats
Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Now, we can find the number of seats occupied by the students by subtracting the number of parents from the remaining seats.

Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, and the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell, we can calculate the price of the gold Jewell as follows:

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * $2000

"Let's break down the problem. Manny signed up for 10 Karate classes for a total of $60. His parents told him that if the classes cost more than $10 per class, they won't sign him up again. 

To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Since Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend at $6 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's say Manny attends x classes at $6 per class and y classes at $10 per class. The total cost of classes should be equal to $60.

6x + 10y = 60

We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can find a whole number solution for y.

If x = 1, 6(1) + 10y = 60
6 + 10y = 60
10y = 54
y = 5.4 (not a whole number)

If x = 2, 6(2) + 10y = 60
12 + 10y = 60
10y = 48
y = 4.8 (not a whole number)

If x = 3, 6(3) + 10y = 60
18 + 10y = 60
10y = 42
y = 4.2 (not a whole number)

If x = 4, 6(4) + 10y = 60
24 + 10y = 60
10y = 36
y = 3.6 (not a whole number)

If x = 5, 6(5) + 10y = 60
30 + 10y = 60
10y = 30
y = 3

Since x = 5 and y = 3 is a whole number solution, Manny can attend 5 classes at $6 per class and 3 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

The maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total weekly production, we need to determine how many customers each person processes in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie's daily production is 50 * 2 = 100 customers.

Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is the sum of their individual weekly productions: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"Let's break down the information given. Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which means Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total. So, Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to multiply the cost of 4 apples by 5/4. 
Cost of 4 apples = $5.20
Cost of 5 apples = $5.20 * (5/4) = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to multiply the cost of 3 oranges by 5/3.
Cost of 3 oranges = $3.30
Cost of 5 oranges = $3.30 * (5/3) = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the hole) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can find the total time it will take him to dig the hole by multiplying the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

The final answer is: 216"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Let's break down Tim's new compensation package. He's getting a 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary, which is a significant boost. To calculate the raise, we multiply his current salary by 0.05:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
This means his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

In addition to the raise, Tim is also receiving a bonus worth half a month's salary. Since half of $20,000 is $10,000, his total monthly income will be:
$21,000 (new monthly salary) + $10,000 (bonus) = $31,000

To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:
$31,000 * 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"
"Let's break down the costs of James' new wardrobe.

First, we need to find the cost of the suits. James bought 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, we need to find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, which is $750 * 1/5 = $150 per pair. Since James bought 10 pairs of dress pants, the total cost of the pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James bought 3 dress shirts for each of the 10 suits, so he bought a total of 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts. Each shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we add up the costs of the suits, pants, and shirts: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"
"Hello, I'd be happy to help you with your question. To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles (news website) + 280 articles (sister company) = 840 articles

"Let's break down the information given. Steve is 60 years old, and his wife is 4 years older than him, which makes her 64 years old.

Since their son is half as old as his mom, we can calculate his age by dividing his mom's age by 2. So, the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Now, we know that Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. To find her age, we subtract 3 from her husband's age. Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to first find the total amount of flour in one bag and then multiply it by 3.

Each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, so the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3 to find the total amount of flour in three bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is: 48"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Bill needs to dig through 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay. He can dig 4 feet of soil per hour, but only half that speed through clay, which is 2 feet per hour.

To find the time it takes to dig through the soil, we divide the total feet of soil by the speed: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

For the clay, we do the same: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to get the total time: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Fishio initially posted a selfie on Instagram and received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes increased to 70 times the initial number of likes. This means the number of likes after 3 weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140000.

To find the total number of likes after 3 weeks, we need to consider the likes received in the 3 weeks. However, we are given that she received 20000 more new likes recently. Since the number of likes after 3 weeks is 140000, the number of likes received in the 3 weeks is 140000 - 2000 = 138000.

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the total number of likes after 3 weeks. Total likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. However, she got a $2 discount because she had a voucher. To find the total cost, we need to subtract the discount from the total price:
20 * $20 = $400
$400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of pomegranates increased to $30 each, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. First, we need to find the total cost without the discount:
20 * $30 = $600
Now, let's calculate the discount:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
To find the total cost with the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$540 - $398 = $142

"Let's break down Ariadne's sales. In a particular month, her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total sales from green hats in that month ""x"". Then, the sales from red hats in that month is $400, which is half of x, so x/2 = $400.

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = $400 * 2 = $800.

So, in that month, Ariadne's total sales from green hats were $800 and from red hats were $400.

The total sales in that month are $800 + $400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"Let's break down the situation. Sally started the week with $200 in her bank account. She received no other money, but her account now holds $420. Her weekly wage should be $300. To find out how much was withheld from her wage, we need to calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received.

First, let's find out how much she should have had in her account if she received her full wage. 

Expected wage: $300
Initial amount in the account: $200
Expected total: $300 + $200 = $500

Since she actually has $420 in her account, we can find the difference between the expected total and the actual amount to determine how much was withheld.

Actual amount: $420
Expected total: $500
Withheld amount: $500 - $420 = $80

Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves she needs to make. We already know she needs 48 deviled egg halves.

Number of deviled egg halves needed: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

"To find the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly hanger rental is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for a year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, so it is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for a year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we add the initial cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Lee has sheep and geese on his farm. We're given two pieces of information: the total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20.

Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can write the equation 4S + 2G = 70 to represent the total number of legs.

We also know that each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, so the total number of heads can be represented as S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Now, let's substitute G = 20 - S into the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

The equation for Janey's books would be 2x + 3, since it's 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. We can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2

So, Sally has 9 books."
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find out how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 4 + 8 = 12.

When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 8 dogs initially, there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. This means there are a total of 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys. This brings the total number of toys needed to 12 + 28 = 40.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 40 - 3 = 37.

The final answer is: 37"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that three people invested a total of $1200 in a joint savings account. 

First, we need to find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is (2/5) * 1200 = 480.

Now, we need to find out how much money is left after Dylan's investment. The remaining amount is 1200 - 480 = 720.

Next, we need to find out how much Frances invested. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is (2/3) * 720 = 480.

Now, we need to find out how much money is left after Frances' investment. The remaining amount is 720 - 480 = 240.

So, Skyler's investment is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"Hi there, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help the sisters, Carol and Jennifer, figure out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach their goal.

Let's start by adding up the number of signatures each sister has collected so far. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures so far = 20 + 44 = 64

The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the total signatures they have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36

Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, we can divide the number of signatures they need by the number of weeks to find out how many signatures they need to collect per week.

Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12

So, the sisters need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of 100 signatures."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows: 

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

We can then cross-multiply to solve for x:

6x = 96 * 36
6x = 3456
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: 576"
"To find out how much the group of adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 adults and then subtract the maximum load.

First, we'll find the total weight of the 9 adults. Since an adult weighs an average of 80 kg, we multiply this by the number of adults.

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Now, we'll find the difference between the total weight of the 9 adults and the maximum load of the elevator, which is 700 kg.

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Max has 5 less cookies than Katarina, we can find Max's total by subtracting 5 from Katarina's cookies: 68 - 5 = 63 cookies for Max.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we subtract 12 from Max's total: 63 - 12 = 51 cookies for the Cookie Monster.

Now, we know Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. To find Summer's total, we add 23 to Max's total: 63 + 23 = 86 cookies for Summer.

To find the total number of cookies, we add up the number of cookies each person has: 68 (Katarina) + 63 (Max) + 51 (Cookie Monster) + 86 (Summer) = 268.

The final answer is: 268"
"I'd be happy to help Shania with her dress design. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the final length of the dress is 140cm. We also know that 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. To find the original length, we need to subtract this added length from the final length.

The added length is 20cm, so we subtract 20 from 140 to find the length before the lace trim was added. 

140 - 20 = 120

However, we also know that the dress was extended by 50% of its original length. Let's call the original length 'x'. The extension is 50% of x, which is 0.5x. 

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x + 0.5x = 120.

Combine like terms: 1.5x = 120.

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Chris has a two-speed lawn mower. He can mow his entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. Alternatively, he can mow the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode in 40 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to calculate the time it took for each mode and then add them together. To find the time for each mode, we multiply the time for each mode by 0.5 (half).

Time in turtle mode: 60 minutes * 0.5 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode: 40 minutes * 0.5 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"Hello, I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to get to the fire station. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is, and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. So, the total time to get to the fire station is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time to get to the fire station from the total time they have. Total time they have = 30 minutes, Time to get to the fire station = 19 minutes. 

Time left to get to school = Total time they have - Time to get to the fire station
Time left to get to school = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left to get to school = 11 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, we need to find the age of one of the twins.

Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t.

We have two pieces of information: the sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44, and the older twin is 7 years older than the triplet. 

The first piece of information can be written as an equation: T + (T+7) + t = 44

The second piece of information can be written as an equation: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, we need to find the age of the older twin. 

The age of the older twin is T+7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"

"Hello there. To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. 

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

The cost of 4 candies is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. Therefore, the cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Rong saves 20 coins every month, and Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we need to calculate 2/5 of 20, which is 8. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year: 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

Let's break it down step by step. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, which cost $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits in it. 

First, let's find the cost of one banana. Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs twice as much, which is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we find the cost of one orange, which is three times as much as a banana. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

First, let's start with the red squares: there are 14 of them. 

Next, we know there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

Then, there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

Lastly, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add the number of squares of each color together: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

The total number of squares is 68. Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"Hello there. I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many more chairs Mia's restaurant needs to get for the function.

First, let's find out how many regular chairs the restaurant has. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can multiply 8 by 5 to get the number of regular chairs.

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed. We have 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function, so we add those together.

Total number of chairs needed = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57

Next, we need to find out how many chairs the restaurant already has. We already know there are 8 high chairs, and we calculated that there are 40 regular chairs.

Total number of chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of chairs needed.

Number of chairs needed to be added = Total number of chairs needed - Total number of chairs available
= 57 - 48

"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We have four students in class 3B: Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find out how many points that is, we need to calculate 30% of 50. 30% is the same as 0.3, so 0.3 * 50 = 15. Therefore, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Now, let's find out how many points Tom has. We know that Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Next, we need to find out how many points Martha has. We know that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now that we know how many points each student has, we can find the total points collected by the class. The total points collected by the class is 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we need to subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold. So, the class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks from her backyard display.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 0.4 by 300, which equals 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard display. She will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard display is 3 * 5 = 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know there are 8 males and 6 females in the group. To find the total number of people, we add the number of males and females: 8 + 6 = 14.

Next, we're told that each female ate 3 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. To find the total number of dumplings eaten by males, we multiply the number of males by the number of dumplings each male ate: 8 * 4 = 32.

Now, we add the total number of dumplings eaten by females and males to find the total number of dumplings eaten: 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two types of ice cream being produced: chocolate and vanilla.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate of chocolate ice cream, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

Now, let's look at the production rate of vanilla ice cream. The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate of vanilla ice cream, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now that we have the production rates for both types of ice cream, we can calculate the total quarts produced in 48 hours. For chocolate ice cream, it would be 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts. For vanilla ice cream, it would be 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts.

To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream together: 2400 + 600 = 3000.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you figure out how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy. 

To start, let's calculate how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so Erin can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. 

To take advantage of the deal, Erin should buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops. 

The remaining $1.50 can be used to buy 1 more scoop, making it a total of 4 scoops.

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two people, Ginger and Amy, who both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day.

To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of candies they eat in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount. Two weeks is equal to 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Now, let's calculate how much candy each person has left. Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Mr. Boarden's bathroom remodeling. To find out how many mosaic tiles he needs, we first need to calculate the area he wants to cover. Since he wants to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can calculate this as (2/3) * 36.

To do this, we multiply 2 by 36, which gives us 72, and then divide by 3. 72 divided by 3 is 24. So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 sq ft.

Now, we know that for every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 sq ft, he would need 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"Let's calculate how much James saved by picking blueberries himself. 

First, we need to find the total cost of picking the blueberries. The initial cost is $20, and then there's an additional $1.5 per pound. Since James picked 30 pounds, the total cost of picking the blueberries is $20 + $1.5 * 30 = $20 + $45 = $65.

Now, let's find the cost of buying the blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries for $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds, so the total cost at the store would be $2.5 * 30 = $75.

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store: $75 - $65 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"Hello, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the total amount of money the company paid, we need to first find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. The new price is 10% higher than the original price. 

10% of $700 is 0.1 x 700 = $70. 

The new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money the company paid for 500 computers. 

The total amount is 500 x $770 = $385,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people receive interviews out of the 100 applicants. Since 30% of them receive interviews, we can calculate this as follows:

30% of 100 = 0.3 * 100 = 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we need to find out how many of those who receive interviews get a job offer. Since 20% of them receive a job offer, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, we need to find out how many of those who receive a job offer accept the position. Since a third of them accept the position, we can calculate this as follows:

A third of 6 = 6 / 3 = 2 people accept the position.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother, we need to know how many sacks she gave away in total. We know she gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. 

Total sacks given away = 3 + 4 = 7 sacks

Since there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, we can multiply the total sacks given away by the weight of each sack.

Total kilograms given away = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

"Let's break down Helga's clog dancing into two scenarios: when her arms are down and when her arms are up.

When her arms are down, Helga taps her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute and her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute. This results in a total of 550 taps per minute. Over 3 minutes, she would tap a total of 550 * 3 = 1650 times.

When her arms are up, Helga taps her right and left feet at a rate of 200 taps per minute each. This results in a total of 400 taps per minute. Over 2 minutes, she would tap a total of 400 * 2 = 800 times.

To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we add the total taps from both scenarios: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"Let's break down the situation. Ron is worried about the pothole in front of his house, as it's going to cause $450 worth of damage to his car if it's not fixed. However, the city council won't take care of it, and if Ron decides to fix it himself, he'll be fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance. On top of that, he'll need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.

To calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole, we need to add the fine and the cost of the asphalt. The fine is $120, and the cost of the asphalt is 3 * $25 = $75. So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, let's compare this to the potential damage to his car. If the pothole isn't fixed, it will cost Ron $450. Since fixing the pothole costs $195, we can find out how much money Ron saves by subtracting the cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is: $255"
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 chairs for babies. If 20 of the normal chairs and 13 of the baby chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair, we can calculate the total chairs left as follows:

Total normal chairs = 170
Total baby chairs = 23

Total chairs sent for repair = 20 (normal) + 13 (baby) = 33

Total chairs left = Total normal chairs - 20 + Total baby chairs - 13
Total chairs left = 170 - 20 + 23 - 13
Total chairs left = 150 + 10
Total chairs left = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people in total (Bryce and 4 friends). 

First, let's find out how many slices Bryce and two friends ate. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

5 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 5 * 8 = 40 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 5 people, but we know that 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by 3 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

Now, we subtract the number of slices eaten by 3 people from the total number of slices eaten by 5 people to find the number of slices eaten by the remaining 2 people:

40 slices - 24 slices = 16 slices

Now, we know that 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 = 9). So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 friends is:

2 friends * 9 slices/friend = 18 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten by all 7 people from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

Total number of slices = 5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices
Total number of slices eaten = 24 slices + 16 slices + 18 slices = 58 slices
Number of slices left = 60 slices - 58 slices = 2 slices

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages, we need to multiply the time the cat takes by 2/3. 

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog. 

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. To make calculations easier, we'll convert this to just inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply 8 by 12 to get 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches to that gives us a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. We can write the equation as: x * 9 + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: x * 9 = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us: x = 10

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each, and Hannah smashes a quarter of the windows. To find the total number of windows smashed from students' cars, we multiply the number of students' cars by the number of windows per car and then multiply by the fraction of windows smashed: (64 * 4) * (1/4) = 256 * (1/4) = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each, and Hannah smashes three-fourths of the windows. To find the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars, we multiply the number of teachers' cars by the number of windows per car and then multiply by the fraction of windows smashed: (32 * 2) * (3/4) = 64 * (3/4) = 48.

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' and teachers' cars: 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to first calculate the total number of blue spools. We have 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools, so the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60.

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. We have 15 light blue spools, 45 dark blue spools, 40 light green spools, and 50 dark green spools, so the total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 5000 people lined up at a polling station to cast their vote. 

First, we need to find out how many people voted by midday. 2/5 of the people had voted by then. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, we need to find out how many people voted by 16:00. 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by then. 
The number of people remaining after midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

So, the total number of people who voted by 16:00 is 2000 (by midday) + 2000 (by 16:00) = 4000.

To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we subtract the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the total number of people.
5000 - 4000 = 1000

"To figure out how many boxes of graham crackers we need, let's start by calculating the total number of smores required. 

9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.
The total number of smores required is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, the total number of sleeves needed is 24 / 8 = 3.
Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the total number of boxes needed is 3 / 3 = 1.

Let's start by finding Dora's father's age. We know that it's eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

Dora's father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8 
= 2 * 15 + 8 
= 30 + 8 
= 38 years.

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. We know that she is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can calculate her age as follows:

Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4 
= 38 - 4 
= 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

We have a class of 50 students. Out of these, 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music. We're also told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who prefer playing basketball.

Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball, and we know that 5 students like to play basketball, we can calculate the number of students who like to play music as 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, let's find the total number of students who like to either play video games or play music. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of students who like to bake and the number of students who like to play basketball from the total number of students.

Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball)
= 50 - (10 + 5)
= 50 - 15
= 35

Since we know that students who like to play music = 10, students who like to play video games = students who like to play video games or music - students who like to play music
= 35 - 10

Additional students required = 54

Since each group requires 9 students, we need to find the number of additional groups required.

Additional groups required = Additional students required / Students per group
Additional groups required = 54 / 9
Additional groups required = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"Hello there. I'm Fatima, and I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month).

In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. 

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekend days: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, multiply the total chairs rented in a week by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month):
500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"Let's break down the sequence of events to find out how many bananas Gunther had at the end.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas, so the number of bananas left is 48 / 2 = 24.

Gunther added 25 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 24 + 25 = 49.

Arnold stole 12 bananas, so the number of bananas left is 49 - 12 = 37.

Gunther added 6 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 37 + 6 = 43.

The final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to divide the total monthly bill by the number of roommates and then multiply the result by 12.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the bill equally among themselves.

$100 / 4 = $25 per roommate per month.

Now, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 to get the yearly amount:

$25 * 12 = $300 per roommate per year.

The final answer is: $300"
"Hello, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many glasses and plates Jeff sent for the party. Since he sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates, we can calculate the total number of each item by multiplying the number of dozen by 12.

Glasses: 8 dozen * 12 = 96 glasses
Plates: 4 dozen * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items from the total number of items sent:
- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

Glasses left: 96 - 10 = 86
Plates left: 48 - 6 = 42

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

The final answer is: $\boxed{86}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30 small stickers, we multiply 0.9 by 30, which equals 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. To find 50% of 40 large stickers, we multiply 0.5 by 40, which equals 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

Next, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers, 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons. To find the total number of buttons she has, we add these together: 3 + 20 + 27 + 20 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Joey's football matches. 

To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add the matches played on Monday, Friday, and Saturday. 

Joey played 2 matches on Monday. 
He played 1 match on Friday. 
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches played on each day: 
2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the council has 33 members and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. 

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since there are twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you figure out how many shirts Krissa needs to order for her preschool students.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that 11 students need size extra-small. Since twice as many students need size small as extra small, that's 2 * 11 = 22 students.

Next, we're told that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.

Now, half as many students need size large as size medium, which means 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.

Finally, six more students need size extra-large than large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 students.

To find the total number of shirts ordered, we add the number of students for each size together: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the final price after the discount, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The bag is marked at $140 and has a 5% discount. 

To find the discount, multiply the original price by the discount percentage (5% or 0.05).

Discount = $140 * 0.05 = $7

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price.

Final price = Original price - Discount
Final price = $140 - $7
Final price = $133

The final answer is: $133"
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to calculate the total number of songs and then multiply it by the length of each song in hours.

First, we multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists:
300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs

Then, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song in hours:
6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours

The total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is 60000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win the big race. To find this number, we multiply 0.2 by 50, which equals 10 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, the remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40.

60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. To find this number, we multiply 0.6 by 40, which equals 24 people.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. Since 24 people think horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 40 - 24 = 16 people.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
2. One third of the Pomeranians are girls.
3. There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, and we are given that this number is 6. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we found that there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jayden initially had $70 from selling pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

Now, we need to find the total amount of money Jayden has. We add the initial amount he had to the amount his sister gave him: $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the three houses need a total of 250 cases of shingles. The first house needs half of what the second house needs, and the third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases the second house needs as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

Now, we can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total is 3 * $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total is 5 * $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total is $3.

Now, let's add their totals together: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

"Let's break down the problem. George has 45% more pears than bananas. If he has 200 bananas, we need to find out how many pears he has and then calculate the total number of fruits.

To find the number of pears, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas. 

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90 pears

Now, we add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits.

Total number of fruits = number of bananas + number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 90
Total number of fruits = 290

"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with Tanya's earnings.

To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches less than 3 classes, she does not earn an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add the earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Bennet's problem. 

Let's break it down step by step. Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3.

"Let's break down Tatiana's weekend schedule. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which gives her a total of 12 hours for the weekend.

Tatiana spends 3 hours reading, leaving her with 9 hours for other activities. Since she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, we can calculate that as 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

Now, let's find out how much time she spends playing soccer. We subtract the time spent reading and playing video games from the total available time: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

So, the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer is 50%."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of them to Brandon. To find out how many pencils he gave to Brandon, we multiply 50 by 1/2.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection.

First, we need to find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of movies by 3:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:
200 * $6 = $1200

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

Now, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply the remaining movies by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies. We subtract the number of older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies

The cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Now, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost:
$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot. 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to understand how the scores are calculated. Ava and Emma receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on, 5 points for each berry they collect, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level.

Let's assume Emma's score is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8. Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is 30 * (60 - (x + 4)) = 30 * (56 - x) = 1680 - 30x.

Emma's total score is x + 0 (since she doesn't jump on any extra enemies or collect any extra berries) + 0 (since she finishes the level in the same time as the timer is 60 seconds) = x.

Ava's total score is (x + 8) * 10 + (x + 3) * 5 + (1680 - 30x) = 10x + 80 + 5x + 15 + 1680 - 30x = -15x + 1775.

The difference in their scores is (-15x + 1775) - x = -16x + 1775.

However, we don't have any information about the value of x. We can assume that the difference in their scores is the difference in their enemy and berry scores, and the difference in their timer scores.

The difference in their enemy scores is 8 * 10 = 80.
The difference in their berry scores is 3 * 5 = 15.
The difference in their timer scores is 30 * 4 = 120.

The difference in their scores is 80 + 15 + 120 = 215.

The final answer is: $\boxed{215}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known.

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Total cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Total cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. He then bought some more fish from the pet store, where a sales assistant dipped out 17 fish from a mixed tank.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O. After adding these fish to his pond, he found that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

We can set up two equations based on this information. The first equation comes from the fact that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17: W + O = 17.

The second equation comes from the fact that Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We can solve the second equation for O: O = 2(4 + W) - 3 = 8 + 2W - 3 = 5 + 2W.

Now we can substitute this expression for O into the first equation: W + 5 + 2W = 17.

Combine like terms: 3W + 5 = 17.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12.

Divide both sides by 3: W = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to determine the total distance he travels in a week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

The distance between his home and office is 5 miles, and he travels this distance twice a day (to and from work), so the total daily distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost per week: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt to use for lunch. If she spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties, we need to calculate the total amount of money she paid for the lunch.

First, let's find the value of the quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, we need to find the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie had 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3 and divide by 5: (10 * 3) / 5 = 30/5 = 6. So, she spent 6 twenties. The value of 6 twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent to find the total amount of money she paid for lunch: $35 + $120 = $155.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with John's school trip fund. 

To figure out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Half of the trip cost = $300 / 2 = $150

The school will cover $150, and John has $50. To find out how much John is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the amount the school will cover:

Amount John is missing = Amount school will cover - Amount John has
= $150 - $50
= $100

The final answer is: $100"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent his pipes from freezing.

First, let's determine the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point. The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night. So, the night temperature is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Now, we need to find the temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature. That would be 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent his pipes from freezing.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total number of seashells, we first need to find the number of groups and then the number of groups that brought back seashells.

First, let's find the number of groups. We know that 90 people need to be split into groups, and each group has 9 people. 

Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Next, we find the number of groups that brought back seashells. We know that 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells.

Fraction of groups that brought back seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought back seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought back seashells
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought back seashells = 6

Now, we find the total number of seashells. We know that each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells.

Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's calculate the number of people on the train. 

Initially, there were 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

The number of people on the train is 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's calculate how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month. 

Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day on his way home, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. To find the total amount of money he makes in a month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the value of each bottle cap and then multiply the result by the number of days in the month.

First, let's calculate the daily amount:
10 bottle caps * $0.25 = $2.50 per day

Now, let's multiply the daily amount by the number of days in the month:
$2.50 * 30 = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. 150% of $20 is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. For 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"Hello there. I'm Fatima, a zookeeper here at the local zoo. I'm responsible for counting the lions in our enclosure. Let's see... we have 12 female lions. Now, I know we have half as many male lions as female lions, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. And, of course, we also have 14 adorable lion cubs.

To find the total number of lions, I just need to add these numbers together: 12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

So, Mike is looking to buy a pair of jeans that originally costs $40. He finds out that they're 25% off. To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 25% of $40. 

25% of $40 is 0.25 * $40, which equals $10. 

Now, let's find the price after the discount. We subtract the discount from the original price: $40 - $10 = $30.

Since Mike is paying with a $50 bill, we need to find out how much money he'll have left over. To do that, we subtract the price after the discount from the $50 bill: $50 - $30 = $20.

So, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total salary for each month, then multiply it by 3.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After 3 months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
200 employees * $4000 = $800,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount every month for 3 months, the total amount paid is:
$800,000 * 3 = $2,400,000

The final answer is: $2,400,000"
"Hello there. I'm Fatima, and I'd be happy to help you with Carrie's caroling schedule.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find Billy's hourly wage after his raises. He was initially paid $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Then, on his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Sally's hourly wage. Her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Next, we need to find their total earnings after working 20 hours. 

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the reforestation campaign at Ashley's school. To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

First, let's find the total number of trees planted by the students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000. Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is 1000.

Next, let's find the total number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120. Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the overall total. 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30% or more.

"Let's break down Kris's gaming schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks, which is 14 days. So, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

Then, she plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week, which is 7 days. So, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

To find the total hours Kris has played, we add the hours from both periods: 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Now, to find out how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we subtract the total hours she has played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two cars on the highway, with the first car traveling at 60 miles per hour and the second car passing it at 70 miles per hour. We want to find out how many miles will separate them after 2 hours.

First, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. The distance traveled is equal to the speed multiplied by the time. So, for the first car:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars will be the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the ring, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the 30% premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. 

First, we add the cost of the diamond and the gold: $600 + $300 = $900.

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium. To do this, we multiply the total cost of the diamond and gold by 0.3: 0.3 * $900 = $270.

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold: $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. To find the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders, and the pass rate of fourth-graders is 40/100, the pass rate of fifth-graders is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many chips he has in total. 

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with 144 chips. 

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it can be. 

We know that the area of a rectangle (such as the mosaic) is length * width. Since we know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), we can find the length.

Area = length * width
12 = length * 3
length = 12 / 3
length = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can find the total amount of tea drank in gallons by dividing 38 by 4, which equals 9.5 gallons. 

However, we are asked to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, which is the sum of the tea drank and the tea left. 

The amount of tea left is given as 10 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 (tea drank) + 10 (tea left) = 48 quarts.

To convert this to gallons, we divide 48 by 4, which equals 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies. Then, he sold 150 of them. To find out how many candies he has left, we need to subtract the number of candies he sold from the initial number of candies he ordered.

100 (initial candies) - 150 (candies sold) = -50

However, we can't have a negative number of candies, so this means Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold. Let's continue with the problem.

Dale then ordered 100 more candies. To find the total number of candies he has now, we add the initial number of candies to the additional number of candies he ordered.

100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200

Now, we need to find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell to sell all of his candy. We subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he has.

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We start with 10 students at the beginning of the year. Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- January: 10 students (initial)
- February: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- March: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- April: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- May: 80 * 2 = 160 students

Now, let's find the number of additional students by subtracting the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 160 - 10 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"Let's break down the problem. Felix charges $0.25 for every branch he has to climb to retrieve items stuck in trees. He made a total of $105 during the week.

To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch.

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (5 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers. Rose starts by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each, which gives us 3 * 5 = 15 petals. Then, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each, resulting in 4 * 6 = 24 petals. Next, she adds 5 flowers with 4 petals each, giving us 5 * 4 = 20 petals. Finally, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each, which amounts to 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

However, Rose drops 1 petal from each set of flowers, so we need to subtract 4 petals from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals.

The final answer is: 97"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that John and DeSean bought a bag of marshmallows, and they want to make S'mores. The bag has 35 marshmallows in it. Each S'more requires one marshmallow.

John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean also makes 9 S'mores. So, the total number of marshmallows used by them is 9 + 9 = 18. 

In addition to the marshmallows used, they also dropped 3 on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

Now, let's find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag. We subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows: 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are two kids, John and DeSean, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have: 14 / 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jack and his friends play for a total of 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's consider the time each of them plays. Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. Two of his friends are worse than him and can only play half as long, so they play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes each. The other friend is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so they play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

The total time played is 240 minutes, and we can set up an equation to find the number of quarters used: 10 + 10 + 30 + 20x = 240, where x is the number of minutes Jack plays. Solving for x, we get x = 170 minutes.

Now, we know that Jack plays for 170 minutes and the other two friends play for 10 minutes each. The total time played is 170 + 10 + 10 = 190 minutes. The better friend plays for 30 minutes.

The total time played is 190 + 30 = 220 minutes. Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the cost per minute is 1 / 20 = $0.05.

The total amount of money used is 220 * 0.05 = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"Let's break down the information given: Tanya makes a salt scrub that fills a 10-ounce jar. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She also uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"

To find the total amount of money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats: 3 goats * $500 = $1500.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows: 2 cows * $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent a total of $4500 at the market.

Now, we subtract the number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63.

63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which gives us 8 cars sold.

Now, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

So, Joe gives away a total of 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the problem. The charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. To find out how much the students raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations from the total.

$175,000 (total) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000 (raised by students)

Now, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total number of cars 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 of the cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

To find the number of cars remaining in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that were present when he got out of class for the lunch break, which is 35.

"Hello there. Let's break down John's weekly earnings. He does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle consists of 5 different tasks. Each task pays $1.20.

First, we need to find out how much John makes in a day. To do this, we multiply the number of cycles he does in a day by the number of tasks in each cycle and the pay per task.

Daily earnings = 30 * 5 * $1.20
Daily earnings = $180

Since John works a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7 to find out his total weekly earnings.

Weekly earnings = $180 * 7
Weekly earnings = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"Let's break down the information given about Sasha and Julie's basketball games. 

In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. We know that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. So, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.

Now, let's look at the second game. Sasha struggles during away games, and this one was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her points from each game: 14 + 4 = 18.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many eggs Cindy had altogether. 

Let's start by counting the number of eggs of each color. Cindy had 5 green eggs. Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she must have had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

Next, we know Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, which means she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Boris's chocolate production. Let's break it down step by step.

Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week. In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. 

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:

"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's break down the time Britany spends on TikTok-related activities per week:

- She spends 2 hours writing amateur songs, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes on makeup, 6 days a week, which is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.
- She records 18 videos, each lasting 4 minutes, so that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time she spends on these activities: 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) + 72 minutes (videos) = 282 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of the interior design installation for Angela.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors, cost: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier, cost: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures, cost: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Total cost of additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Total cost: $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, we know that Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take a total of 18 hours to cross the highway. To find out how long it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway, we need to divide the total time by the number of kangaroos. 

So, 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo.

Now, we're told that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means they will take twice as long to travel across the highway. 

Since there are four turtles, we need to multiply the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2 and then by 4. 

First, we multiply by 2 to account for the turtles' slower speed: 6 hours * 2 = 12 hours per turtle. 

Then, we multiply by 4 to account for the number of turtles: 12 hours * 4 = 48 hours.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so 3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, let's find the total number of slices: 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

"Let's break down Gabriel's situation. He wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. To find out how much money he still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080. Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help him, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items:
$10080 - $5200 = $4880

So, Gabriel still needs $4880."
"To find the change, we need to subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount Thea gave the craftsman. 

First, let's calculate the total amount Thea gave the craftsman: 4 * $20 = $80

Now, let's subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount: $80 - $70 = $10

Thea got $10 as change."
"Let's break down Craig's expenses. He has 2 twenty dollar bills, which is a total of $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack collected by dividing the number of dishes by 2. Jack collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes together is 180."
"Let's break down the information given: there are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. 5 of them are good at math only, and 8 of them perform well in English only. The rest are good at both math and English.

To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English. Since the students good at both math and English are counted in both groups, we need to add them to the students good at math only.

Let's find the number of students good at both math and English. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only and English only is 5 + 8 = 13. So, the number of students good at both math and English is 20 - 13 = 7.

Now, we can find the total number of students good at math by adding the students good at math only and those good at both math and English: 5 + 7 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"Hi there, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with Vicki's pop concert planning.

To figure out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and then divide it by the time each group takes to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time for each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes to perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

After 1 year, Brenda will have: $300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525
After 2 years, Brenda will have: $525 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $750
After 3 years, Brenda will have: $750 (previous total) + $225 (interest) = $975

The final answer is: $975"
"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to find the number of white shirts with collars and subtract it from the total number of white shirts. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20.

The number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to find the number of floral shirts with buttons and subtract it from the total number of floral shirts. The number of floral shirts with buttons is 20.

The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

The difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

"Hello there. To find out how much the farmer will earn from selling the eggs, we need to first determine how many trays he can fill. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs and the farmer has 900 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30

Now, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings:

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many goats were sold from Farm Y. Since Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, and he sold 10 goats from Farm X, we can calculate the number of goats sold from Farm Y by multiplying the number of goats sold from Farm X by 2. 
Number of goats sold from Farm Y = 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we know that Mr. Smith sold 20 goats from Farm Y. To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm Y.
Number of goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of goats left in Farm X. We know that Mr. Smith initially had 55 goats in Farm X and he sold 10 goats. To find the number of goats left in Farm X, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in Farm X.
Number of goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45

Finally, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y.
Total number of goats left = 45 + 25 = 70

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two types of baskets: green food baskets that cost $25 each and red food baskets that cost $18 each. We're buying 3 baskets of each type.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 green food baskets: 3 * $25 = $75. Then, we calculate the cost of 3 red food baskets: 3 * $18 = $54.

Now, we add the costs of both types of baskets together: $75 + $54 = $129. However, we also get a discount of $2 for each red food basket. Since we bought 3 red food baskets, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

To find the final cost, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $129 - $6 = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to determine the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms in total, we calculate one-half of that.

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Now, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. To find the total time, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have the following information:

- I am three years younger than my brother, so my age is x and my brother's age is x + 3.
- I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack.

First, let's find the total number of glue sticks required. There are 27 students in the class, and each student needs 2 glue sticks. So, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Now, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack, which is 8. 54 / 8 = 6.75.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the initial amount of water passing through a river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons, so we add that to the amount from the second day: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to add the amounts from all three days: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"

Day 1: 
- Initially, there are 10 people infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new people are infected.
- Total people infected after Day 1: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together. Jennifer bought 12 oranges from the market. She gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, which is a total of 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. Then, she gave her only boy 3 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges Jennifer gave to her children in total, we add the oranges given to her daughters and her son: 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, to find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves every hour, and she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. So, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked a total of 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and we need to convert this to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can divide the price per slice by 100 to get the price in dollars: 50 cents / 100 = 0.5 dollars per slice.

Now, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

However, I made a slight mistake in my calculation. Let me redo it. 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars."
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can find the number of silver coins by subtracting 30 from the number of gold coins.

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
Number of silver coins = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins.

Total number of coins = Number of silver coins + Number of gold coins
Total number of coins = 40 + 70
Total number of coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George.

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

The total number of burritos eaten is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos in total, the number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the information given about the bumper car rink. We know they have 12 red cars. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Next, we're told the rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. This means the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, let's add up the number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has a total of 75 cars, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the overall total: 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We can express the relationship between Sofie and Anne as S = A + 25. We can also express the relationship between Anne and Fawn as A = F - 12.

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25. This simplifies to S = F + 13.

We also know that S + A + F = 85. Substituting the first equation into this equation, we get (F + 13) + A + F = 85.

Combine like terms: 2F + A + 13 = 85.

Substituting the second equation into this equation, we get 2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85.

Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84.

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To do this, we multiply 2/5 by 60. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

Next, we know he ate 10 pieces on the second day.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find this out, we multiply 7/13 by 26. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate on each day: 
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to first find the cost of 1 bottle of soda and 1 bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of 1 bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens is:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, we are told that he needs to make a profit of $2000, so the total amount he needs to make from selling the chickens is $9000 + $2000 = $11000.

Since he will make $9000 from selling the chickens, the amount he needs to make from selling the chickens to make a profit of $2000 is $9000. 

However, we are asked for the cost price of the chickens. To find the cost price, we need to subtract the profit from the selling price. 

The selling price is $9000 and the profit is $2000. 

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $2000
Cost price = $7000

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses of lemonade. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold together by subtracting the number of glasses Julie sold from the total.

Total glasses sold = 32
Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold - Glasses sold by Julie = 32 - 14 = 18

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses each of them sold by dividing the total number of glasses they sold by 2.

Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 18
Number of people selling glasses = 2
Glasses sold by Micah = Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

Now, we can find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 9
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 9 = 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, we can find the cost of one pack of bacon by dividing the total cost by the number of packs: $10 / 5 = $2. Then, we multiply this by 2 to find the cost of one packet of chicken: $2 * 2 = $4. Now, we multiply the cost of one packet of chicken by the number of packets Kelly has: 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, we need to find the cost of the apples. Since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, and the strawberries cost $4 each, we can find the cost of one pack of apples by dividing the cost of a strawberry by 2: $4 / 2 = $2. Now, we multiply the cost of one pack of apples by the number of packs Kelly has: 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we add up the cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it includes a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as x minutes. Since the final concert is twice as long, its runtime is 2x minutes. Adding the 15-minute encore, we get the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, 2x = 50.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2, x = 25.

So, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

However, the singer has 50 microphones in total. 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, which means 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x
0.8 * 50 = 2x
40 = 2x
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that one-fourth of her 100 plants are indoor plants. So, we calculate the number of indoor plants: 100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants.

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total to find the remaining plants: 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Next, we find the number of outdoor plants, which is two-thirds of the remaining plants: 75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants: 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x + 3x + 5x = 9x. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x (for Joe's lawn) + 18x (for Kamala's lawn) + 30x (for Alba's lawn) = 54x.

We know that the total amount she made from both lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. So, we can set up the equation: 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

To find y, we need to find the value of x. Since we know she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find y. 
54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 80 - 54
y = 26

To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first find the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

"Let's figure out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get. 

First, we need to find out how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took some. Susan started with 100 cookies and her husband took 4, so there are 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's break down the information given. Denise read 10 pages yesterday, and Daniel read 13 pages yesterday. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, we only need to consider his yesterday's reading.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday. Denise read 5 more than that, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

To find out Denise's total pages read, we add her yesterday's and today's reading: 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel: 28 - 13 = 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Calvin's pot can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since there are 4 adults (Calvin, his wife, and 2 children) and each adult eats one bowl, 4 adult bowls will be used for dinner. 

Since 4 adult bowls are equal to 4 child bowls, 4 child bowls will also be used for dinner. This leaves 4 child bowls of soup leftover.

Now, we need to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. There are 2 children, and we have 4 child bowls of soup left. To find the answer, we divide the total number of child bowls by the number of children: 4 / 2 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To determine how much material Jo needs to make face masks for her class, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, we know that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks. So, the material needed per small mask is 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per mask. To make 20 small masks, Jo will need 20 * 0.5 yards = 10 yards of material.

For large masks, we know that 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks. So, the material needed per large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per mask. To make 8 large masks, Jo will need 8 * 0.75 yards = 6 yards of material.

Now, let's add the material needed for small and large masks together: 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

First, we need to find out how many red shoeboxes Tim used. To do this, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9.

1/3 of 9 = 9 / 3 = 3

So, Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes to go fishing.

Now, let's find out how many shoeboxes are left. Initially, Tim had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. After using 3 blue and 3 red shoeboxes, he is left with:

Blue shoeboxes: 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoeboxes: 9 - 3 = 6

Therefore, the total number of shoeboxes left is 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10.

"To find out how many books Joseph has, we first need to determine how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, we multiply 9 by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

So, Joseph initially had 18 books. However, he lost 2 of them. To find out how many books he currently has, we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books.

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives 1/5 of them to Jamie. To find out how many marbles that is, we need to divide 30 by 5. 

30 / 5 = 6

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Dean has left. To do that, we need to subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he started with. 

First, let's add up the marbles he gave away: 6 (to Jamie) + 10 (to Donald) = 16

Now, let's subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he started with: 30 - 16 = 14

So, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write the equation: (Duncan's age eight years ago) = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)
So, (60 - 8) = 2x
52 = 2x
x = 26

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam's age four years ago was 26, his current age is 26 + 4 = 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38.

First, we need to find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. This is 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day are 320 * $0.20 = $64.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by 30 minutes (since he drinks a bottle every half hour).

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so it takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, we need to divide the total time by 30 to find out how many bottles he drinks. 

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. There are 20 red balloons, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

We also know that the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58. Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3 times the number of yellow balloons.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. The total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3y. We can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

To solve for y, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 18.

Then, we divide both sides by 3: y = 6.

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, we can multiply this by the number of days to find the total miles driven.

Total miles driven = 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we need to divide the total miles driven by the interval at which Jon's car needs a tune-up, which is every 1000 miles.

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven / 1000 = 3000 / 1000 = 3

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream for their father's birthday. 

The cake costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since the balloons are sold in sets of 2 for $0.5, we need to find out how many sets of 2 balloons are in 12. To do this, we divide 12 by 2, which equals 6. Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set: 6 * $0.5 = $3. 

Next, they bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. The total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items they bought: $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many pets Larry has.

To start, Larry has 3 cats. Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, he must have 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, we know he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Now, let's talk about his fish tank. He has three times the number of fish as rabbits, which means he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Moving on to his gerbils, he has 1/3 the number of fish, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old, and by her 10th birthday, she has been collecting for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months to get the total number of months.

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows. To find out how many cups are in each row, we divide 27 by 3.

27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9 / 2.

9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row. However, since we can't have half a cup of tea, we need to consider the context of the problem. If there are 4 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 5 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 4 = 12. 

If there are 5 mint tea cups in each row, then there would be 4 chamomile tea cups in each row, and the total number of mint tea cups would be 3 * 5 = 15. 

Since the total number of mint tea cups is 15, the correct answer is 5.

- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Money left: $150 - $130 = $20

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for other days: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for other days cost $7, so he can see $10 / $7 = 1.4286 (round down to 1 since you can't see a fraction of a movie) more movie on other days.

Total movies Colby can see: 1 (on Friday) + 1 (on other days) = 2

"Hello, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and Jean's age as J.

From the information given, we can form the following equations:

1. P + Pp + J = 100
2. Pp = J + 10
3. P = Pp + J

We can start by substituting Pp with J + 10 in equation 1:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Now, we can substitute P with Pp + J in the equation P + 2J + 10 = 100:
(Pp + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Substitute Pp with J + 10:
(J + 10 + J) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
3J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
3J = 80
Divide both sides by 3:
J = 80/3
J = 26.67

Now that we have J, we can find Pp:
Pp = J + 10
Pp = 26.67 + 10
Pp = 36.67

Now that we have Pp, we can find P:
P = Pp + J
P = 36.67 + 26.67
P = 63.34

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000.

First, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. To do this, we'll multiply the number of widgets each machine can make per hour by the number of hours it runs in a day and then by the number of days in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now that we know how many widgets each machine can produce, we can calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

Widgeteer 3000 revenue: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000 revenue: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we need to subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue of the Widgeteer 3000:

Cameron arrives at a hotel in the Philippines at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. He has two options: pay 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. However, he decides to go with the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the 24-hour option and the cost of his stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours. 

The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos. 

The 12-hour option costs 1000 pesos, and Cameron needs to add 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark. Since he stays for 17 hours, he needs to add 70 * 5 = 350 pesos for the additional 5 hours.

So, the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option plus the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"Hello, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, let's first calculate his total earnings.

John earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours in the week, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

Next, let's subtract the gas cost and the deposit from his earnings. He spends 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank.

Remaining money: 300 - 50 - 100 = 150 dollars

Now, let's calculate how much money John has left after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.

Cost of pencils: 5 * 10 = 50 dollars
Remaining money after buying pencils: 150 - 50 = 100 dollars

Now, let's find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money.

Number of pens: 100 / 25 = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the problem. Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. To find the total number of letters in the words he spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters Craig spelled to the total number of letters his brother spelled: 300 + 350 = 650.

The final answer is: 650"

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles she gives to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she gets is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, to find out how many bottles she has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she got.

900 - 58 = 842

The final answer is: 842"
"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the visit fee.

First, let's calculate the labor cost. Since Patty charges $35 per hour, or part thereof, for labor, we multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly rate. In this case, Patty worked 2.25 hours, so the labor cost is 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75.

Next, we need to add the cost of parts, which is $60, and the visit fee, which is $40.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"Let's break down James' situation. He bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so the total cost is 10 * $15 = $150. However, he got a 40% discount, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60. After the discount, he paid $150 - $60 = $90.

James then sold 5 CDs for $40 each, making a total of 5 * $40 = $200. To find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the amount he spent. So, he was out $90 - $200 = -$110. The negative sign indicates a loss.

The final answer is: -$110"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you calculate how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops.

To find out the total earnings, we need to calculate the earnings from each type of root crop and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the yams. Jen has 6 yams that can be sold at $1.5 each, so the earnings from yams are 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we'll calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes. Jen has 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each, so the earnings from sweet potatoes are 10 * $2 = $20.

Lastly, we'll calculate the earnings from the carrots. Jen has 4 carrots that cost $1.25 each, so the earnings from carrots are 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the earnings from each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

"Let's break down James' journey across the lake. First, we need to find the time it took him to swim 60% of the 20-mile lake. To do that, we need to calculate 60% of 20 miles.

60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had, so we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"Let's figure out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end. 

Jasmine was given 15 stickers for participating in class. Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. To find out how many stickers she has left, we subtract the stickers she lost from the stickers she was given initially: 15 - 7 = 8

After that, her teacher gave her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates. To find out the total number of stickers she has now, we add the stickers she received for helping her classmates to the stickers she already had: 8 + 5 = 13

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much commission Cayley will earn from selling newspapers.

First, we need to calculate the commission from the New York Times. The number of copies sold is 6, the price per copy is $5, and the commission rate is 10%. To find the commission, we multiply the number of copies sold by the price per copy and then multiply by the commission rate, and finally divide by 100.

Commission from New York Times = (6 * 5 * 10) / 100
Commission from New York Times = 300 / 100
Commission from New York Times = $3

Next, we need to calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal. The number of copies sold is 10, the price per copy is $15, and the commission rate is 8%. To find the commission, we multiply the number of copies sold by the price per copy and then multiply by the commission rate, and finally divide by 100.

Commission from Wall Street Journal = (10 * 15 * 8) / 100
Commission from Wall Street Journal = 1200 / 100
Commission from Wall Street Journal = $12

Now, we add the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal to find the total commission.

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

Deanna's age: 26
Marcus's age: 26 - 5 = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. To find Leo's age, we need to multiply Marcus's age by 2.

Marcus's age: 21
Leo's age: 21 * 2 = 42

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored.

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. 

We can simplify this to A - D = -10. 

Now, we can add D to both sides to get A = D - 10. 

We can substitute A = D - 10 into the equation B = A + 20 to get B = (D - 10) + 20. 

This simplifies to B = D + 10. 

We can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B + A + D = 45 to get (D + 10) + (D - 10) + D = 45. 

This simplifies to 3D = 45. 

We can divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15. 

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation A = D - 10 to get A = 15 - 10. 

This simplifies to A = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, we have 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers to the inch, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

The book is 1.5 inches thick, so the total number of pages in the book is 200 * 1.5 = 300 pages.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. Vince stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60:
15 * 60 = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 / 15 = 60

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply the number of reports per set by the number of sets:
30 * 60 = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her total sleep time: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

The final answer is: 457"
"Hello there. Let's break down the problem step by step. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can find the number of spoons by multiplying the number of cups by 2/3. 

24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 spoons.

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of cups and spoons together.

24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

"Hello, I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to determine the number of occupied beds. Since 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we can calculate this as follows:

1/5 of 1000 = 200

This means that 200 beds are occupied initially. 

Now, let's calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to multiply 50 by 14 (the number of days in 2 weeks).

50 * 14 = 700

Now, we add the number of occupied beds initially to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

200 + 700 = 900

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds.

1000 - 900 = 100

"Let's break down Robyn's emails. She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work-related. To find out how many non-work emails she sends, we subtract the work emails from the total: 16 - 7 = 9.

Now, we know that two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family. To find two-thirds of 9, we multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3: (2 * 9) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. So, 6 emails are to her family.

The remaining non-work emails (not to family) are 9 - 6 = 3. Now, we need to find out how many of these emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1 * 3) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

From point 3, we know Aliya's age is 3 years. 
From point 2, we know Shawna's age is three times Aliya's age, so Shawna's age is 3 * 3 = 9 years.

From point 1, we know Shawna's father's age is five times Shawna's age, so Shawna's father's age is 5 * 9 = 45 years.

Let's assume the number reported by Courtney is 100%. 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, let's find the total number of balls carried by the three boys. We add the number of balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls carried by the boys, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is also 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day. On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

Amora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally, but it turned out that only two people would get an equal amount, while the other person would receive 15 more corn chips than the number the others got. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each.

Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add the number of corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = 70 + 70 + 85
Total = 225

"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies: 50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Then, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel: $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three friends, Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe, who are trying to catch Pokémon. Together, they have caught a total of 339 Pokémon.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. We know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so we can write an equation: L = S + 5.

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less Pokémon than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write another equation: S = 4A - 13.

Now, let's use the fact that the total number of Pokémon caught by all three friends is 339. We can write an equation: A + S + L = 339.

Substituting the first equation into the third one, we get: A + (S + 5) + S = 339.
Combining like terms, we get: A + 2S + 5 = 339.

Substituting the second equation into the previous one, we get: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339.
Expanding the equation, we get: A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339.
Combining like terms, we get: 9A - 21 = 339.

Adding 21 to both sides, we get: 9A = 360.

Dividing both sides by 9, we get: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's break down the information given: each episode of the show is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Since there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, the number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 10 hours. The bird flies at a speed of 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled is 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Next, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this direction is 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Finally, the bird changes direction and flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this direction is 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Since the bird traveled 36 miles north, we need to subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to find the net distance between the two homes.

Net distance = Distance traveled in the first 10 hours + Distance traveled in the last 5 hours - Distance traveled in the 2 hours
Net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{374}$"
"Let's break down Greta's brownie situation. She started with a batch of 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies. Then, her office sent her home with 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. Her friends added to the mix with 4 dozen brownies, that's 48 brownies. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially. 
12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

However, things got a bit messy during the party. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were devoured, which is equivalent to 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

To find out how many brownies Greta has left, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she had. 
66 (total brownies) - 18 (brownies eaten) = 48

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. To find the total number of wooden slats needed for Robert's garden fence, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges at the market. Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She then gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, let's find out how many oranges she has left. She had 240 oranges initially and gave away 80, so she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract 50 from 60: 60 - 50 = 10.

Since Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the information given for Sunny's fundraiser.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. This means he sold 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which is 15 boxes. He also sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

- Total earnings on Saturday = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15) = 60 + 165 = 225.
- Total earnings on Sunday = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15) = 90 + 225 = 315.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 225 + 315 = 540.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need for her vacation, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use.

She reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day. So, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day for 8 days, which is 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce. So, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Since each bottle of sunscreen is 8 ounces, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces) to find out how many bottles she will need.

32 / 8 = 4

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

The price of the blue car is $100. To find 40% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.4. This gives us $40.

Now, we subtract the discount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car: $100 - $40 = $60.

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The total cost of both cars is the sum of their prices: $100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the information given:

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. 

From the information, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil will be 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

From this, we can also deduce that when Emil turns 24, his dad will be twice as old as Emil. So, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Now, we need to find the current age of Emil's dad and brother. Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old (since Emil is 19 now and will turn 24 in 5 years). Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the information given. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend. So, 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down Joe's crawfish catch. On Thursday, he caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how many students are leaving early, we first need to determine the number of football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate 20% of 30 students.

20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students.

Now, we need to find out how many students are not football players. This is 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or band members, we calculate 25% of 24 students.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members. 
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to add their shoe sizes and divide by 2.

Sophie's shoe size is 5. 
Charlie's shoe size is 5 times Sophie's, so it is 5 * 5 = 25.

The sum of their shoe sizes is 5 + 25 = 30.
The average shoe size is 30 / 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the width of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract 18 inches from the total length of the flower bed for each plant. However, we also need to subtract the width of the plant itself (12 inches) from the remaining length. 

Let's denote the number of plants as 'n'. The total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is 1332 - 18n - 12n = 1320 - 30n.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 'n - 17' more flowers. The total cost of the flowers will be the number of flowers she needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower, which is (n - 17) * 6.

We know that the total length of the flower bed after subtracting the space for 'n' plants is equal to the width of the plant (12 inches) multiplied by the number of plants (n). So, we can set up the equation: 12n = 1320 - 30n.

To solve for 'n', we can add 30n to both sides of the equation: 42n = 1320. Then, we can divide both sides by 42: n = 1320 / 42 = 31.4286. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 31 plants.

Now that we know Pat needs 31 - 17 = 14 more flowers, we can calculate the total cost: 14 * 6 = 84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of 18. 

1/2 of 18 = 18 / 2 = 9

9 * 7 = 63

The final answer is: 63"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Katherine's hanging basket problem. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias. Katherine has 5 baskets and she wants to add 3 petunias to each one. So, the total number of petunias is 5 * 3 = 15. Each petunia costs $3.00, so the total cost of petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines. Katherine has 5 baskets and she wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each one. So, the total number of sweet potato vines is 5 * 2 = 10. Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50, so the total cost of sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together to find the total cost. $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"Let's calculate how many roses Artemis and her father can plant with the 30-pound bag of soil. 

First, we need to find out how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations. They are planting 4 sunflowers, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. So, the total soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, they are planting 10 carnations, and each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. So, the total soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

They have 30 pounds of soil in total, so the amount of soil left for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Let's break down Jessica's situation. She makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. To find out how much she saves each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she saves $500.00 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year to find the total savings in a year: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we need to divide the total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, let's break down the tasks. 

First, we need to find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

However, since peeling and cooking are done simultaneously, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes. The maximum time is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Next, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

However, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is not running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the second time, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet and then use that information to determine Bill's age at the time of the second sighting.

Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Three times the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet is 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. This means that 75 years have passed between the two sightings.

So, Bill's dad was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when Bill was born.

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, Bill was 30 - 15 = 15 years old when his dad was born.

Now, let's find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. We know that 75 years have passed between the two sightings, and Bill was 15 years old when his dad saw the comet for the second time. 

To find Bill's age at the first sighting, we need to subtract 75 from 15. 

15 - 75 = -60

However, age cannot be negative, so this calculation doesn't make sense. Let's re-examine the problem.

We know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 90 years old. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. 

This means that Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill was 90 years old. To find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet, we need to subtract 75 from 90.

90 - 75 = 15

So, Bill's dad was 15 years old when he saw the comet. 

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, we can set up an equation to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

Let x be Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

The time between the two sightings is 75 years, so we can set up the equation:

x + 75 = 30

To solve for x, we need to subtract 75 from both sides of the equation.

x = 30 - 75
x = -45

However, age cannot be negative, so this calculation doesn't make sense. Let's re-examine the problem.

We know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 90 years old. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill saw it for the second time. 

This means that Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years before Bill was 90 years old. To find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet, we need to subtract 75 from 90.

90 - 75 = 15

So, Bill's dad was 15 years old when he saw the comet. 

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, we can set up an equation to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

Let x be Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

The time between the two sightings is 75 years, so we can set up the equation:

x + 75 = 30 + 75

x + 75 = 105

To solve for x, we need to subtract 75 from both sides of the equation.

x = 105 - 75
x = 30

"Let's break down Buford's check-writing habits. He writes a check every month for his electric bill, which means he writes 12 checks per year for that. He also writes a check every month for his gas bill, adding another 12 checks per year. Additionally, he writes two checks to the church every month, which amounts to 24 checks per year. Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service every three months, so that's 4 checks per year.

To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to add these numbers together: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

"Let's break down the information given. We know that the first plane makes a total of x flights per day. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the total number of flights made by the first plane by doubling the number of flights made by the second plane. So, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. To find the number of flights to Greece, we multiply the total number of flights made by the first plane by three-quarters. This gives us (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights to Greece.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we subtract the number of flights to Greece from the total number of flights made by the first plane and then divide the result by 2. This gives us (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11 flights to France.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem of the three little wolves who howl at the moon every night. Let's break it down step by step.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam bought some new trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6 to help him buy the trousers. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12.

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers. 

$30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (money from parents) = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings to buy the trousers.

The final answer is: $12"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We have four children: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.

Let's start by finding the total age of Akbar and Alessandro. 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age = 3 + 4 = 7

Since the total age of the children is 20, we can express the total age as: 
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20

We are also given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. 
Average age = (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4
Helene's age = 2 * ((7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4)

We can simplify the equation by substituting Helene's age in terms of the average age:
Helene's age = 2 * ((7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4)
Helene's age = (2 * (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age)) / 4
4 * Helene's age = 2 * (7 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age)
4 * Helene's age = 14 + 2 * Helene's age + 2W
2 * Helene's age = 14 + 2W
Helene's age = 7 + W

Now we can substitute Helene's age in the first equation:
7 + (7 + W) + W = 20
14 + 2W = 20
2W = 6
W = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"

However, Walter's lawyer will only consider the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, not the $200 donated by Walter's friend. 

So, the amount the lawyer will multiply by 3 is $2000. 

To find the amount the lawyer will donate, we multiply $2000 by 3. 

$2000 * 3 = $6000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

Next, the bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a family of 6, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids. They want to divide a watermelon in such a way that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

To simplify the problem, let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units. If each kid gets x units, then each adult gets 2x units, since they get twice as much as each kid.

The total amount of watermelon given to the kids is 4x (4 kids * x units each). The total amount given to the adults is 2x (2 adults * 2x units each).

Since the total watermelon is 100 units, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2x = 100.

Combine like terms: 6x = 100.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 100 / 6 = 16.67.

Now that we know each kid gets 16.67 units, each adult gets 2x = 2 * 16.67 = 33.33 units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, divide the amount each adult gets by the total watermelon and multiply by 100: (33.33 / 100) * 100 = 33.33%.

So, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 33.33"

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes
Convert total time from minutes to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We are given that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation:

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do this next:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles
Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.
Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"Hello, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Brook Hills High School has a total of 3000 students. We're given that half of these students are over 16 years old, which means there are 1500 students over 16. 

Now, let's find out how many of these students are male. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 are male, we can calculate this by dividing 1500 by 4, which gives us 375 male students over 16.

To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Next, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which is also 1500 students. We're told that half of these students are male, so we can find this by dividing 1500 by 2, which gives us 750 male students under 16.

To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Finally, to find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"Let's break down the information given about the number of laps each person can run in an hour.

Bethany can run 10 laps in an hour. 
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. 
So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Maria's power bank was losing 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours. After that, it started losing 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. We're given that the final charge remaining is 28%.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

For the next 3 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%. However, we know that the final charge remaining is 28%, so the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 34% - 28% = 6%.

Now, let's find the charge remaining after 8 hours. We know that the charge lost in the last 3 hours is 6%, so the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34% - 6% = 28%. This means that the charge remaining after 8 hours is indeed 28%.

To find the initial charge, we need to find the amount of charge lost in the first 5 hours. The charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%, so the charge lost in the first 5 hours is 100% - 55% = 45%.

Now, we can set up the equation: x - 45% = 55% (charge remaining after 5 hours).

Solving for x, we get x = 100%.

However, this is not possible since the power bank wasn't fully charged when Maria went to the park. Let's re-evaluate the equation: x - 45% = 55% (charge remaining after 5 hours).

We can rewrite the equation as x = 55% + 45% = 100% + 45% = 145%. However, this is also not possible since the power bank's capacity cannot be more than 100%.

Let's re-evaluate the equation again: x - 45% = 55% (charge remaining after 5 hours).

We can rewrite the equation as x = 55% + 45% = 100% + 45% = 145% is incorrect, so we need to re-evaluate the equation x - 45% = 55% (charge remaining after 5 hours).

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Janet's problem. 

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. 20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000) to find out how many weeks she needs to work. 

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruits. He's already bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, 4 pears at $0.5 each, 2 kiwis at $1 each, and 5 apples at $0.75 each.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Jamaar had:
$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to determine how many packs she gave away. Since Anne kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, let's divide the number of packs she gave away by the number of friends. 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are in 0.3 packs. To do this, we multiply 0.3 by 60. 

0.3 * 60 = 18

So, each friend received 1 pack (60 pieces) and 0.3 packs (18 pieces). To find the total number of pieces each friend received, we add these two numbers together.

60 + 18 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"Let's break down the information given. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and divided them equally among 8 albums. Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, we can find the number of pictures in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, let's find the number of selfies. Since 3 albums were selfies only, we multiply the number of selfies albums by the number of pictures per album.

3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 albums - 3 selfies albums - 2 portrait albums = 3 albums. 
The number of portraits is 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 portraits.

To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we add the number of selfies and portraits together.

27 selfies + 27 portraits = 54

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

James reads 18 pages in total. Since he reads 3 pages per set, we divide 18 by 3 to find the number of sets: 18 / 3 = 6 sets.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we multiply the number of sets by the time per set: 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.

"Hello there. Let's break down the situation at the hotel. We have 100 guests initially. Then, 24 guests check out early, leaving us with 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

Next, 15 guests opt for a late checkout, so we subtract those from the remaining guests: 76 - 15 = 61.

Now, in the afternoon, twice as many people check in as those who opted for a late checkout. That's 2 * 15 = 30 guests checking in.

So, we add those to the remaining guests: 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more people check in after dinner, bringing the total to 91 + 7 = 98.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: x = 2y.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120, which is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. We can write an equation: 4x + 12y = 120.

Since x = 2y, we can substitute this into the equation: 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8y + 12y = 120, which is 20y = 120.

To find the value of y, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: y = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since x = 2y, we can find the value of x by multiplying y by 2: x = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The family eats 5 sandwiches per day by the man, 4 sandwiches per day by the wife, and 2 sandwiches per day by their son. 

So, the total number of sandwiches they eat per day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.

In one week, they eat 11 * 7 = 77 sandwiches.

The final answer is: 77"
"Let's break down Suzanne's earnings. She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80. 

Next, she sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that the Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 60 eggs. There are 10 eggs that were not found by anyone.

To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we need to subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs from the total number of eggs.

Eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - (Eggs found by the Smith twins + Remaining unfound eggs)
= 100 - (60 + 10)
= 100 - 70
= 30

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. He can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

Now, let's calculate how much more ore he can mine with a steel pickaxe compared to an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now that we know one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, we can find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day. We multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2 and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to 3/2 and 3/2. 

Since the ratios are the same, the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches will be proportional to the price of the second package. 

The price of the second package is $6 for 4 sandwiches. To find the price per sandwich, we divide the price by the number of sandwiches: 6/4 = 1.5. 

Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: 1.5 * 8 = 12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month for the bedroom set, we need to calculate the remaining balance after he sells his old bedroom set and then determine the monthly interest payment.

First, let's find out how much Tom still owes after selling his old bedroom set:

Total cost of bedroom set: $3000
Amount paid from selling old bedroom set: $1000
Amount still owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to find out how much Tom has to pay per month. The interest rate is 10% per month, so we need to calculate 10% of the amount still owed:

Amount still owed: $2000
Interest rate: 10% = 0.10
Monthly payment: $2000 * 0.10 = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sally initially had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. To find the number of red balloons that burst, we multiply 25 by 0.4: 25 * 0.4 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons Sally has: 15 red balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 34.

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance) 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). However, this scenario is dependent on the normal teacher not giving an extension, which has a 60% chance (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this scenario is 20% * 60% = 12%.

The total probability of not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: 50% + 40% + 12% = 102%. However, this is not possible since the total probability must be 100%. This means we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100% to find the probability of having to turn in his homework.

To find the probability of having to turn in his homework, we need to subtract the total probability of not having to turn in his homework from 100%. However, the total probability of not having to turn in his homework is 102%, which is not possible. This means we need to subtract 100% from 102% to get -2%. However, we can't have a negative probability, so we need to add 100% to -2% to get 98%.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 98%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to subtract the number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950
Available seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats
Available seats = 6000 - 950
Available seats = 5050

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates = 950
Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5.32

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question asks for the number of tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, implying that the remaining tickets are for guests.

Therefore, the answer is 5 tickets per graduate."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we need to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. We're told that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we can set up a proportion.

Let's say x is the number of small beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Then, 3x = 150. To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 150 / 3 = 50.

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

The final answer is: 50"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Melissa's jury pay situation. 

To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Total earnings: 3 days * $15 per day = $45
Total expenses: 3 days * $3 per day = $9

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: 
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Next, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total: 
Total hours = 6 hours per day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses:
Hourly pay after expenses = Net earnings / Total hours
Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18
Hourly pay after expenses = $2

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to determine the total number of soda bottles and then multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

"Let's break down Jim's situation. He took out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, which totals to $200,000 in loans. Additionally, he lost $25,000 per year for 4 years due to not working while in college, which amounts to $100,000 in lost income.

The total amount Jim needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, Jim's income triples to $75,000 per year. To find out how long it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width, so the area of one piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, Johnny's dad lost $5 in the first race. 

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

The number of races is 3. To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three people who divided an amount of $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first, and the third person took twice what the second took.

Let's denote the share of the first person as x. The second person's share would then be x + 80, and the third person's share would be 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combining like terms, we get: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Simplifying further, we get: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtracting 240 from both sides, we get: 4x = 1680.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 420.

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is equal to 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car is $20,000, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * depreciation rate)
= $12,472 - ($12,472 * 0.21)
= $12,472 - $2,620.32

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
- 4 twin beds = 4 * 2 = 8 twin sheets
- 1 king size bed = 1 king sheet
- Total sheets = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (4 sheets) and 1 king set (1 sheet) at a time, we need to find the maximum number of sets that can be washed in a week. 
- 4 twin sheets / 2 twin sets = 2 sets
- 1 king sheet is already a set, so it's 1 set
- Total sets = 2 + 1 = 3 sets

Now, we multiply the total sets by the number of loads per set to find the total loads per week.
- 3 sets * 1 load/set = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the total loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to find the total loads per year.
- 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes.

Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan's part took, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: 58"
"Let's break down the costs of Hannah's doctor's visit.

First, there's the cost of the cast, which is $200. 

Next, we have the cost of the doctor's visit. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit lasted for 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Hannah also needs to pay for painkillers. She needs 30 painkillers at $4 each, so the total cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Lastly, there's the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"Let's break down James' email situation. He gets 80 emails a day, but 20% of those don't require a response. To find out how many emails he doesn't respond to, we need to calculate 20% of 80.

20% of 80 is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

Now, let's calculate how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

In a 5-day work week, James responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the total number of classes that visited:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

The final answer is: 247"
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, let's add up the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we need to calculate 70% of 20. 

70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and there are 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of coupon. The cost per small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents. The cost per big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of small coupons and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. To find out how many he ordered, we need to subtract 3 from 10. 

10 - 3 = 7

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

7 * 4 = 28

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, there were 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left. Sidney ordered 3 more sub sandwiches. 

3 + 3 = 6

Now, there are 6 meatball sub sandwiches left. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 

6 * 4 = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of trucks by 1/4.

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4)
= 20 * 0.25
= 5

Now, we can find the number of trucks that reached the farmers by subtracting the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks.

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = Total number of trucks - Number of trucks with mechanical failures
= 20 - 5
= 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:
Total tons of fertiliser = Number of trucks that reached the farmers * Tons per truck
= 15 * 20
= 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

Since Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he needs 6 pounds of butter. 

The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, so for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays the full price of $4.00 for one pound and half off for the other pound. 

For 6 pounds of butter, he will need to buy 3 sets of 2 pounds. 

The cost for 3 sets of 2 pounds of butter is:
- 3 sets * $4.00 (full price) = $12.00
- 3 sets * $2.00 (half off) = $6.00
- Total cost for 6 pounds of butter = $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total cost of Kayla's party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and multiply it by the cost per guest, then add the initial fee.

First, let's find the total number of guests attending the party. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and the 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members. However, 4 people said they could not come. So, the total number of guests attending is 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. The number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost per additional guest is $6. So, the cost for the additional guests is 21 * 6 = $126.

Now, we add the initial fee of $125 to the cost for the additional guests to get the total cost. The total cost is $126 + $125 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending some of their money, we can assume that the amount they spent is the same for both of them.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Maggie had as M and the initial amount of money Riza had as R. We know that M = R = $60.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. So, the amount of money Maggie has left is 3/4 * M = 3/4 * $60 = $45.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. So, the amount of money Riza has left is 2/3 * R = 2/3 * $60 = $40.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add the money Maggie and Riza have: $45 + $40 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for his three monkeys, which will last them for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many bananas they eat each day by dividing 315 by 7.

315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day

Now, let's consider the eating habits of the monkeys. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten each day. 

45 (total bananas per day) - 10 (first monkey) - 14 (second monkey) = 45 - 24 = 21 bananas

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 
Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 pieces. 
So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"Hello there. So, Jenny goes to the florist to buy some flowers. Roses cost $2 each and $15 for a dozen. She bought 15 roses and arrived with five $5 bills. The florist only has quarters for change.

Let's break this down. Since Jenny bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective to buy them by the dozen. 15 roses is 1 and 3 roses. 1 dozen is 12 roses, so she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses.

1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's calculate the total amount of money Terry makes from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas.

"To find the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time he needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the current time is 0 minutes, Paul needs to wait from 0 to 145 minutes for the fourth train. However, we need to consider the time he waits from the first train's arrival to the fourth train's arrival.

- Paul waits from 0 to 10 minutes for the first train.
- He waits from 30 to 60 minutes for the second train.
- He waits from 65 to 125 minutes for the third train.
- He waits from 125 to 145 minutes for the fourth train.

The total time Paul waits is the sum of these intervals: 10 + (60 - 30) + (125 - 65) + (145 - 125) = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first calculate how many toothpicks she has saved so far. She saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so the total number of toothpicks she saved is 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, and she already has 120, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs: 200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week: 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is:
2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:
1500 * 1.2 = $1800

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the price he paid:
2000 - 1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
(200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%

"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish per second.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since there are 5 springs, and each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we multiply the total number of seconds by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish per second:

14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many bananas Jenny bought in total. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, we multiply the number of bunches by the number of bananas per bunch: 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 bananas individually. The price per banana is $0.80, so we multiply the total number of bananas by the price per banana: 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, we need to find the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, we multiply the number of bunches by the price per bunch: 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence between them. They agree to split it, with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam. 

Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine its growth rate per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years.

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month.

First, we need to find the number of each type of bike sold. We know that Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, which is 300 / 2 = 150. 

Next, we need to find the number of BMX bikes sold. We know that 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so we multiply 300 by 0.15 to get 45.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105.

Now that we know the number of each type of bike sold, we can calculate the total earnings for each type of bike. The price of a Trekking bike is $450, so 150 * $450 = $67,500. The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500 / 2 = $250. So, 45 * $250 = $11,250. The price of an MTB is $500, so 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The farmer is making hay bales at a rate of 5 bales per hour, and the truck is picking up the bales at a rate of 3 bales per hour. Both the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer. Since the farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, the total number of bales made is 5 * 6 = 30.

Next, let's calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck. The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales picked up is 3 * 6 = 18.

Now, to find the number of bales left in the field, we need to subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and the extra time he dedicates on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total minutes John spends in class. He has 6 periods a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, we multiply the minutes per period by the number of periods and the number of days.

6 periods * 40 minutes per period = 240 minutes per day
240 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1200 minutes per week

John also has 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, which he attends for 5 days a week. We calculate these extra minutes as follows:

2 classes * 40 minutes per class = 80 minutes per day
80 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 400 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes: 
1200 minutes per week + 400 minutes per week = 1600 minutes per week

Next, we need to find the total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He dedicates 1/16 of his weekly minutes to learning on these days. To find his total weekly minutes, we multiply the minutes in a day by the number of days in a week.

There are 24 hours in a day, and each hour has 60 minutes. So, the total minutes in a week are:
24 hours * 60 minutes per hour * 7 days per week = 10080 minutes per week

Now, let's find 1/16 of the total minutes per week:
1/16 * 10080 minutes per week = 630 minutes per week

Since John dedicates this time to learning on both Saturday and Sunday, we multiply the minutes by 2:
630 minutes per week * 2 = 1260 minutes per week

Now, let's add the minutes for the regular and extra classes, and the extra minutes for Saturday and Sunday: 
1600 minutes per week + 1260 minutes per week = 2860 minutes per week

Finally, let's convert the total minutes to hours:
2860 minutes per week / 60 minutes per hour = 47.67 hours per week

The final answer is: 47.67"

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the heights of Caroline's children step by step.

The first child is 6 feet tall. To convert this to inches, we multiply 6 by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. So, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned from selling apples, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before they ate, the velociraptors had 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Now, we need to find out how much meat the velociraptors had before the T-Rex left. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, the T-Rex must have eaten half of the original weight of the triceratops. The velociraptors had 540 kilograms, which is half of what the T-Rex ate. So, the T-Rex ate 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of the room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's break down the situation. Ellen initially had 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas. Then, her brother came along and took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 7 sodas in total, with 1 shaken and 6 unshaken. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans)
Probability = 1 / 7

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability = (1 / 7) * 100
Probability = 14.29%

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 14.29%."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two trains traveling in opposite directions. One train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the other is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the distance each train has traveled after 3 hours, we multiply their speeds by the time they've been traveling. The first train has traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles. The second train has traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they're traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them. So, 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many people Billy helps, we first need to determine the total number of days he works between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy helps: 
50 - 10 = 40

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, multiply the number of days Billy helps by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he helps: 
40 * 6 = 240

To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present. However, the question does not provide the total number of people present. 

Let's start by calculating the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we can assume that the number of people present is equal to the number of people transported (i.e., 480 people) since the question does not provide any other information.

The final answer is: 480"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than him. To find Martha's age, we subtract 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we add 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest waterslide, we need to calculate the time it takes to ride each slide.

The biggest waterslide is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet/minute. To find the time, we divide the length by the speed: 300 / 60 = 5 minutes.

The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long and people slide down at 80 feet/minute. To find the time, we divide the length by the speed: 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Bobby's daily schedule. He takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 

First, we need to calculate the total time spent on breaks. Since he takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, the total break time is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add the lunch time to the break time. The total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. After 5 days, the total time spent is 1 * 5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles. Amber ran 8 miles. To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply the miles Amber ran by 3.5, since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down Sheila's credit card transactions step by step.

First, Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. Then, she returned one item that cost $15.00. This means we need to subtract the cost of the returned item from the initial charge.

$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00

Next, Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price of the frying pan.

$20.00 (original price) - $4.00 (discount) = $16.00

Sheila also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price of the towels.

$30.00 (original price) - $3.00 (discount) = $27.00

The total cost of the new purchases is the sum of the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels.

$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

Finally, we add the total cost of the new purchases to the previous balance to get the new balance on Sheila's credit card.

$70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's dive into the problem. We have a jellyfish tank with an unknown number of jellyfish. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/15 = 6. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x:
x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris. To find Ben's age, we multiply Chris's age by 2:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement and then determine how many years it will take her to save that amount.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, her annual savings will be:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

Next, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary in retirement, her annual retirement income will be:

Annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

Total savings needed = Annual retirement income * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Now, we need to calculate how many years it will take her to save this amount at a rate of $20,000 per year:

Number of years = Total savings needed / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into, and then divide that result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into.

First, divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, divide the result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can find the total number of students by dividing the number of boys by the decimal equivalent of 40%.

40% as a decimal is 0.4. 

Now, let's divide the number of boys by this decimal: 240 / 0.4 = 600

This means the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students by the decimal equivalent of 60%: 0.6 * 600 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you figure out how much your mom spent at the gardening shop. 

To do that, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the coupon discount. 

The cost of the pots is $19, and the cost of the garden soil is $26. 

First, let's add those two costs together: $19 + $26 = $45

Now, we need to subtract the discount of $7 from the total cost. 

$45 - $7 = $38

So, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and divide it by the total number of women.

There are 3 women wearing 4 inch heels and 3 women wearing 2 inch heels. 

The total height of the 4 inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2 inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The total number of women is 3 + 3 = 6.

The average height of heels is the total height divided by the total number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to hike 9,300 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles per day: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since Soledad only has 30 days in June, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the total miles she can hike in 30 days at 250 miles per day: 250 * 30 = 7,500 miles.

The difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she can hike in 30 days is 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the difference by the number of days: 1,800 / 30 = 60 miles per day.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's calculate the total revenue the store will receive after selling all the balls.

There are 3 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 25 green balls in the store. The prices of these balls are $9, $5, and $3 respectively.

To find the total revenue, we need to multiply the number of each type of ball by its price and then add the results together.

Red balls: 3 balls * $9 per ball = $27
Blue balls: 11 balls * $5 per ball = $55
Green balls: 25 balls * $3 per ball = $75

Now, let's add the revenues together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will receive a total of $157 after selling all the balls."
"Let's break down the problem. Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. We need to find out how many kilograms Jacques will have left after Pierre and Paul take their share.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 
Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Now, to find out how much Jacques will have left, we subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount: 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to consider the changes in temperature. The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight, so we subtract that from the initial temperature. 

2 - 8 = -6

Then, it increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. We add this increase to the result.

-6 + 3 = -3

So, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Anna's book-buying problem. 

Let's break it down step by step. Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. 

After buying the 2 books, she had $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

"To find the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

The previous year's enrollment was 50 students. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 0.20 by 50, which equals 10 students.

Now, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60 students.

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we need to determine the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

"Let's break down the information given about Tate's garden pond. There are initially 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. Tate then buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

First, let's calculate the total number of male guppies: 4 (initial) + 2 (additional) = 6 male guppies.

Next, we calculate the total number of female guppies: 7 (initial) + 1 (additional) = 8 female guppies.

Now, let's find the total number of male goldfishes: 3 (initial) + 2 (additional) = 5 male goldfishes.

Then, we calculate the total number of female goldfishes: 5 (initial) + 3 (additional) = 8 female goldfishes.

To find the total number of male fishes, we add the total number of male guppies and male goldfishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes.

To find the total number of female fishes, we add the total number of female guppies and female goldfishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to calculate the total distance of a round trip and then multiply it by the number of times he visits his parents in a month.

First, let's find the distance of a one-way trip. We know it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents at a speed of 70 mph. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Now, we know John visits his parents twice a month. So, we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, she will walk a total of 7 * 10 = 70 miles in 7 days.

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks. Therefore, Brian will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles in 7 days.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 400 toys to produce, and 5 workers are available to work on the order. 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work for 10 hours.

First, let's find the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers in 10 hours. The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour will produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. The other 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. So, the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour. 

Now, let's find the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 10 hours. This is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 400 + 20 = 420 toys. The fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys, which is 420 - 200 = 220 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour is 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we can find its weight by dividing 60 by 4. 

60 / 4 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we can find its weight by dividing 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30 pounds

Now, we need to find the total weight of all the dogs. We have Elijah's two dogs, which weigh 15 pounds and 30 pounds, and Kory's dog, which weighs 60 pounds.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with John's M&M problem. 

To find out how many small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's he has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Since an ounce of M&M's contains 30 M&M's, we can multiply the number of large bags by the weight of each bag and then by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we know John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so we can denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A and Madeline as M, and we can say A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so C + S = 30.

Additionally, we know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so C = S + 12.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S + 12 + S = 30, which simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values of A, M, C, and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms gives 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them into boxes, with each box holding 8 crayons. To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes Nik will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of it, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, we divide 64 by 4 to find the number of logs, as each log is 4 feet.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 * 1.2 = $96

"Let's break down the information given: Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice as much as Valerie, so he earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month. 

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so their mother earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's break down Grandma's walking routine. She walks 3 miles every day, consisting of 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.

Let's assume her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The time spent on the beach can be calculated as distance/speed = 2/x. This is equal to 40 minutes. So, 2/x = 40.

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the speed is 1/10 miles per minute. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"Let's count the blue birds together. We have 3 trees with 7 blue birds in each, so that's 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds. Then, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds in each, which gives us 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds. Lastly, there's 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

To find the total number of blue birds, we add the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24, we can set up an equation: x + 24 = 84, where x is the number of marbles Bob has before receiving 2 dozen more marbles. To find 'x', we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 84 - 24 = 60.

Now that we know Bob has 60 marbles before receiving 2 dozen more marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from 60: 60 - 10 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water, one of which is 33 degrees. 

When he pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other bottle into his water bottle, he's able to drink the water. This means the temperature of the water in the bottle after the transfer must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. The average temperature of the two mugs is (33 + x) / 2. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures multiplied by the total ounces. The total ounces of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle).

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 + x) / 2 * 5. Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

We can set up the inequality (33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40. Solving for x, we get:

(33 + x) / 2 * 5 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 / 2 >= 40
(33 + x) * 5 >= 80
165 + 5x >= 80
5x >= 80 - 165
5x >= -85
x >= -85 / 5
x >= -17

However, the temperature of the water cannot be negative, so we need to find the minimum value of x that satisfies the condition. Since x cannot be negative, the minimum value of x is 40 degrees.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 cows + 230 chickens
= 700 animals

The final answer is: 700"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, and each pack costs $10.00 with 9 bagels in it. To find the total cost of 4 packs, we multiply the cost of one pack by 4.

Total cost of 4 packs = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from the total cost.
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00
Discounted cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
Number of bagels in one pack = 9
Total number of bagels in 4 packs = 4 * 9 = 36

To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels.
Cost of each single bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

The final answer is: $1.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. It's given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. It's given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. Let's first find out how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

Now, we know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops. 

To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to find out how many groups of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops. 18 / 2 = 9. 

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, it takes 3 * 9 = 27 potatoes to make 18 scoops.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats in that time period.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day, so we multiply 3 eggs/day by 30 days.

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Next, we calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days. He increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day, so we multiply 5 eggs/day by 30 days.

5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the number of eggs from the first 30 days and the next 30 days to find the total number of eggs.

90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. So, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we need to find the total number of green and red jellybeans. We add the number of green jellybeans to the number of red jellybeans: 17 + 34 = 51.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"Hello there. Let's calculate the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade. 

To do this, we need to find out how many lemons he gets in a year. Since he has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, we need to find the total number of lemons he gets in a decade, which is 10 years. We multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

The fraction of women in the ratio is 9/14. 

To find the number of women on the bus, we multiply the fraction of women by the total number of passengers: (9/14) * 84 = 54.

Now, we subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquet per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to get the number of bouquets sold per day.

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the number of bouquets sold per day by 12 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets.

7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

Next, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold per day from the individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from the sunflowers per day, we can divide $26 by $2 to get the number of sunflowers sold per day.

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers/day

Now, we can add the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets and the individual sunflowers to get the total number of sunflowers sold per day.

84 sunflowers/day + 13 sunflowers/day = 97 sunflowers/day

Finally, we can multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

The final answer is: 291"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam has $100 to invest in his rock stand. He buys rocks for $5 each and sells them for $7 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * $7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * $5 = $100

However, since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he has to pay for. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 + $40 = $140

To find out how much money Adam loses, we subtract the revenue from the total cost:

$140 - $84 = $56

"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum of these values.

For large-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 5 scenes per day. To find the number of days it will take her to draw 45 scenes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days.

For medium-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 6 scenes per day. To find the number of days it will take her to draw 36 scenes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days.

For small-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 7 scenes per day. To find the number of days it will take her to draw 49 scenes, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days.

The maximum of these values is 9 days, so it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

"Let's break down the situation. Patricia initially had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother. To find out how many roses she has left, we subtract the roses she gave away from the initial number of roses.

30 (initial roses) - 24 (roses given away) = 6

After giving away 24 roses, Patricia had 6 roses left. Then, she bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add the roses she bought to the remaining roses.

6 (remaining roses) + 15 (roses bought) = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

"Let's break down the problem. Mark buys two lottery tickets, one with a 20% chance of winning and the other with a 60% chance of winning (since it's three times more likely to win).

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The probability of the first ticket winning is 0.2 (20% in decimal form). The probability of the second ticket winning is 0.6 (60% in decimal form).

The probability of both tickets winning is 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Let's denote the number of seashells Carlos collected as C. Then, Jim collected C + 5 seashells. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, we can write the equation: C + 5 = 27. Solving for C, we get C = 22.

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as R. Then, Carlos collected 2R seashells. We already know that Carlos collected 22 seashells, so we can write the equation: 2R = 22. Solving for R, we get R = 11.

Now we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells.

They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. The total number of seashells is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60. To find out how many seashells each person gets, we divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people):
60 / 3 = 20

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Mason's carrot consumption. 

To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. 
So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
Total carrots eaten in a week = 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is 60% as a decimal). 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes and 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Linus bought a mobile device for $20 and sold it for twice the amount of the original price, which is $40. 

To find the profit from each device, we subtract the cost price from the selling price: $40 - $20 = $20. 

Since Linus bought 2 devices on Monday, the total cost price for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. The total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. The total cost price for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. The total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than her. 

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2.

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Carla has 8 identical octuplets, and she dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue.

First, we need to find out how many babies are wearing purple and how many are wearing blue. To do this, we multiply the total number of babies by the fraction of each color.

Number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2

Next, we need to find out how many babies wearing purple and blue are also wearing bows. We know that 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows, so we multiply the number of purple babies by 1/3.

Number of babies wearing purple and bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2

We also know that all the blue babies are wearing bows, so we add that to the number of purple babies wearing bows.

Total number of babies wearing bows: 2 (purple) + 2 (blue) = 4

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple by dividing the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiplying by 100.

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

So, the answer is 50%."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land.

First, Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find out how much money John makes in a week, we first need to determine the total number of apartments he collects from. The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so their combined size is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Adding this to 400 gives 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have three ropes: red, blue, and yellow. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. We know that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can start by substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, which gives us 4B + B + Y = 37. Simplifying this, we get 5B + Y = 37.

Now, let's substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37. This gives us 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37. Expanding and simplifying, we get 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6Y - 35 = 37. Add 35 to both sides to get 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6 to get Y = 12. Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y = 12 into the equation B = Y - 7, which gives B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B = 5 into the equation R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. If Ronnie was given $5, then Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.
(15 - x) = 12
-x = 12 - 15
-x = -3
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with: $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

"Let's break down the information given about the wall mural. There are four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. We know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple paint.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the other half is 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6). This 6 pints is the combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x.

We can set up the equation: 3x = 6

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of the bedrooms. Each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

Next, we need to find the area of the living room. It's mentioned that the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Now, let's consider the rest of the house. It's given as 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the areas together: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3160}$"
"I love watching the clouds while I eat my lunch outside at school. To figure out how many clouds I'll see across the week, I need to count them each day. On Monday, I see 3 puffs of clouds. 

On Tuesday, I see double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, I see double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, I see double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, I see double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The final answer is: 93"
"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12 and you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box for $12.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of cycles by 12. 

120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

He triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how many days he can use the chalk after Monday.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, so the remaining chalk is 55% of the original 5 inches.

55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of 2.75 inches.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

The total amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.55x inches. Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.55x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the number of girls and boys on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity: 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Next, we find the total number of students in the class by adding the number of boys and girls: 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

Finally, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students to find the number of students not on varsity: 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought, and then calculate three times that amount and add 2.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 
Three times the amount Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15.
Johnny bought 2 more than that, so Johnny bought 15 + 2 = 17 face masks.

The final answer is: 17"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. James has 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. 

First, we need to find the number of teeth the dentist caps. Since the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, and he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth he caps is 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we need to find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. This is the sum of the teeth he drills and the teeth he caps, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, and then multiply by 100. So, (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"Hello, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

To find the amount of milk that was returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons. 

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons of milk were returned.

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.

Refund = 1600 * 3.5 = 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy in total, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

Total books = Total money / Cost per 100 books
Total books = $27000 / $500
Total books = 54

Since Bob is distributing the money to 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 54 / 3
Books per school = 18

"Let's break down the events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples. Total apples = 1 (in pocket) + 5 (new) = 6.
3. He put all but 1 of the new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 5 apples in his pocket. Total apples = 1 (outside) + 5 (in pocket) = 6.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples from the previous step and 6 new apples. Total apples = 6 (from previous step) + 6 (new) = 12.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, so he now has 12 apples in total.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples."
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to calculate the number of bags of coal he ordered and multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, let's find the number of bags: 
Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, we know the cost per bag is $18. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 * $18
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To figure out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat, and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 * 6 = 36. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

For pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. To find out how many snowballs he builds per minute, we divide 20 by 60, which gives us 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, we also need to consider that 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which they melt, we divide 2 by 15, which gives us 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, let's find the net rate of snowballs by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate: (1/3) - (2/15). To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15. So, we can rewrite 1/3 as 5/15. Now, we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3, which gives us 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find out how long it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. To do this, we divide the number of snowballs by the rate: 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 300"
"Let's figure out Jim's age. We know that John is 28 years old now, and we need to find out how old Jim was 20 years ago. Since John is twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to solve for Jim's age.

Let's call Jim's age 20 years ago ""x"". Since John is twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can write the equation: x * 2 = 8 (because John was 8 years old 20 years ago).

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 8 / 2 = 4.

Now that we know Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago, we can find his current age by adding 20 to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

So, Jim is 24 years old now.

"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (since 50 / 2 = 25).
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 + 50 bandages (since they ordered 1 pack of 50).
After the second day, they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages.
After the third day, they had ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100 bandages (since they ordered 2 packs of 50).

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:
x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:
x = 21

"Hello there. To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days in April. Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Jen receives an additional $10 for each day she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 24 days. Her attendance bonus is 24 * $10 = $240.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings:
Total earnings = Regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $240
Total earnings = $510

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a total of 66 fish in the tank. To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of 66.

One-third of 66 = 66 / 3 = 22

Now, let's find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. We'll subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

Total fish = 66
Fish with red stripes = 22
Fish without red stripes = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44

Next, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish.

5/11 of 44 = (5/11) * 44 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes.

"Let's break down the information given about Mattison's house. We know that Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, which means the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Now, we're told that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

To find the height of the second floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Since we want to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to find the height of the roof from the ground and then subtract the height of the second floor. The height of the roof from the ground is the total height of the house, which is 420 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 20 tourists divided into three groups to find as many shells as possible in a strip mall parking lot. They discovered a total of 700 shells.

First, we need to find the number of shells found by team Alphas, which is 40% of the total shells.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share.

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas

To find out how much John borrowed, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house, which is worth $250,000. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

He used 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To find out how much money he had leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the amount borrowed.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Deandre's tuna-selling problem. 

To find out how much Deandre will earn from selling his tunas, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna he caught weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 
The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the dehumidifier has three settings: low, medium, and high. The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, the medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting, and the high setting removes twice as much as the medium setting.

The medium setting removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day, and the high setting removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.

Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

Next, he ran it for 3 days on the medium setting, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

Finally, he ran it for 5 days on the high setting, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

To find the total amount of water removed, we add the amounts from each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many balloons were thrown during Jolene's water balloon fight, we need to calculate the total number of balloons and then subtract the number of balloons left.

First, let's find the total number of balloons. Jolene and her friends filled up 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons. So, the total number of balloons is 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.

Now, we know that 12 balloons were left at the end of the afternoon. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons: 300 - 12 = 288.

The final answer is: 288"
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the capacity of John's classes, we need to find 1/8 of Ali's class capacity. 

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. 
1/8 of 120 is 120 / 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of Ali's class capacity and John's classes capacity. 
Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

The final answer is: 150"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. 

First, we need to calculate the interest he owes. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

Now, we need to find the remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. This is the initial amount plus the interest minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

The final answer is: $31"
"Let's break down the problem. Jordan has 2 children, and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day. So, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

This means Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's dive into the problem. We're given a jar with a square base, measuring 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall. We need to find out how far off Tim's guess was about the number of red jelly beans in the jar.

First, we calculate the total volume of the jar by multiplying its length, width, and height.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume used by the jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.

Actual volume used by jelly beans = 0.8 * 540
Actual volume used by jelly beans = 432 cubic inches

Now, we find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the actual volume used by the volume of one jelly bean, which is 0.15 cubic inches.

Total number of jelly beans = Actual volume used by jelly beans / Volume of one jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we're told that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans he guessed. Unfortunately, we don't know what Tim's guess was, but we can assume he guessed the number of red jelly beans to be 864.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Number of red jelly beans he guessed
Difference = 900 - 864
Difference = 36

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, the bus has 200 - 180 = 20 spaces left.

The final answer is: 20"
"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from the total number of students. 

There are 4 grades (4-7), and each grade has 10 students. So, the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many groups can be formed: 40 / 8 = 5.

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, and there are 5 groups. Therefore, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Ian has a board that is 40 feet long, and he wants to make a cut so he can have two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine how much of Aiden's secret seasoning he needs, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total seasoning needed.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Luke's fabric shopping. 

To find out how much fabric Luke should buy, we first need to calculate the total width of the windows. Since each window is 35 inches wide and there are five windows, we multiply the width of one window by the number of windows.

Width of one window: 35 inches
Number of windows: 5

Total width of windows = 35 * 5 = 175 inches

Now, Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 = 350 inches

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be x, then the number of brownies is 3x - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation:
x + 3x - 2 = 10
4x - 2 = 10
4x = 12
x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost, let's start with the manicure and pedicure prices. A basic manicure starts at $35, and a pedicure starts at $40. 

Since Karen chooses to get both, we need to calculate the discount for the combined service. The discount is 20% off the total price of both services. The total price of both services is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.2 * 75 = $15.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure after the discount is $75 - $15 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers. The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

First, let's find the price increase in December. An 80% increase from $40 is 0.8 * $40 = $32. So, the new price in December is $40 + $32 = $72.

Next, let's find the price decrease in January. A 50% decrease from $72 is 0.5 * $72 = $36. So, the new price in January is $72 - $36 = $36.

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"Let's break down Charlie's income for the day. He has 4 standard rate lessons and 2 reduced rate lessons. 

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie charges $80 per hour. 
Total amount from standard rate lessons = 4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie charges 75% of his standard rate, which is $80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour. 
Total amount from reduced rate lessons = 2 * $60 = $120

To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we add the amounts from the standard and reduced rate lessons together.
Total amount of money Charlie will make for the day = $320 + $120 = $440

First, Walter bought 60 apples from the store. To find out how many apples he ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find the number of apples remaining.

60 - 24 = 36

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples.

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, let's find the number of apples remaining.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Madeline ate 6 grapes. Then, her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Now, their mother used the remaining grapes to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is 36 / 12 = 3 pies. The total number of grapes used by their mother is 3 * 12 = 36 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) + 36 (by their mother) = 102 grapes. Since the mother used all the remaining grapes to make 3 pies, we can conclude that the initial number of grapes is 102.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Mary makes some strawberry cubes and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes in total, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We can express the relationship between the two as B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116. This can be expressed as S + B = 116.

Now, let's substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

"Let's break down the situation with Brendan and his marbles. He initially had 10 marbles in his bag. When he tripped and dropped half of them, he was left with 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.

After scrambling to search for the dropped marbles, Brendan was able to find 3 more. This brings the total number of marbles he has to 5 + 3 = 8.

However, upon closer inspection at home, Brendan discovered that one of the marbles he picked up was actually a bead, not a marble. So, he got rid of that one, leaving him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus, we need to break down the process step by step.

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the car dealership, 1 will buy a car. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the car dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 person comes into the car dealership. To get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"Let's break down the situation. There are 8 rooms in Brianna's house, and her family has a flashlight for each of the 4 people living there. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Now, let's count the candles. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with Mitchell's nacho problem. 

To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips. Mitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, so the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets. There are 5 family members, so we divide 110 by 5.

110 / 5 = 22

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to add up the time it takes for each side. 

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each. 
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides: 
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

"Let's break down the information given: Dominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there. If there were 20 helmets, we can start by finding the number of robots. Since there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Next, we know there are half as many helmets as footballs. This means the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together: 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call. 

First, we need to convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

To find out how many calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5: 24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have five phones on a phone plan, and the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. The main phone costs $20.

To find the cost of the additional phones, we need to determine the cost of one additional phone. Let's call this cost x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find out how long it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to determine his new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he's become 2.5 times faster.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, let's calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words, we can divide the total number of words by the new speaking speed.

Time = Total words / New speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 hours

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with the problem. 

Let's break it down step by step. Conor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun. On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were present at the beach than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

The total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Garrett is popping popcorn, and we need to find the total number of pieces he has to eat.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to three times the initial amount, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial popping rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

The final answer is: 210"
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make. He's planning to make 4 gallons for the party, and his friend Allen asked him to make an extra gallon that's twice as tart as the others. So, the total amount of lemonade is 4 + 1 = 5 gallons.

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many cups of juice are needed for 5 gallons. 

Total cups of juice = 5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade. This lemonade is twice as tart as the other gallons, which means it requires twice the amount of lemon juice. 

Extra tart lemonade cups = 1 gallon * 2 = 2 cups

Total lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade = 2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons

Total lemons needed for the regular lemonade = 5 cups - 2 cups = 3 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 3/6 * 6 = 3 lemons

Total lemons needed = 2 lemons (for the extra tart lemonade) + 3 lemons (for the regular lemonade) = 5 lemons

"Hello there. To determine the total amount of dog food needed for the kennel, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then multiply it by 7 to get the weekly consumption.

The kennel has 3 German Shepherds, and each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day. So, the daily consumption of German Shepherds is 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms.

The kennel also has 2 Bulldogs, and each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day. Therefore, the daily consumption of Bulldogs is 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

Now, let's add the daily consumption of both breeds to get the total daily consumption: 15 kg (German Shepherds) + 6 kg (Bulldogs) = 21 kg.

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 kg * 7 = 147 kg.

First, we need to find the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals separately. 

For 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs
For 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs

Now, let's add the total number of legs from both types of animals: 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since the question asks for pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs.

Total pairs of legs = 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

"Let's break down Elvis's journey. He travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph. To find the distance traveled west, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.

Then, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed. To find the distance traveled east, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far he is from his house now. 

The distance traveled west is 90 miles, and the distance traveled east is 144 miles. The difference is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

"Let's calculate the value of the boat after three years.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. 

In the first year, it depreciated by 30%, which is 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. So, the value after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, it depreciated by another 30%, which is 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. So, the value after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, it depreciated by 20%, which is 0.2 * $4410 = $882. So, the value after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the bag has 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies. Out of these, 54 are red. 

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so it is 2 * 54 = 108.

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so it is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add their individual weights together. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each. 

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

Force = 1% * 1600
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

"Hello, I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters in the family. The 3 sisters are the same age, which is 16 years old. 

Now, let's find the age of the older brother. Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. This gives us 24 years.

Next, we need to find the total age of the 3 sisters. Since they are all the same age, we can multiply 16 by 3 to get the total age of the sisters, which is 48 years.

Now, let's find the total age of the 2 brothers. We already know that one brother is 12 years old, and the other brother is 24 years old. So, the total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36 years.

Finally, we can find the total age of all the siblings by adding the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters. This gives us 48 + 36 = 84 years.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, let's break it down. Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, which is a total of 30 minutes per day. Since she meditates 7 days a week, the total meditation time per week is 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

For yoga, she practices for 1 hour, or 60 minutes, 5 days a week. So, the total yoga time per week is 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week.

To find the total time spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"I'm happy to help Octavia with her quilt. To calculate the total square feet of fabric used, we need to find out how much fabric each type of shirt contributes.

Small t-shirts are 3 square feet each, and Octavia has 11 of them. So, the total square feet from small shirts is 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.

Medium t-shirts are 4 square feet each, and Octavia has 8 of them. So, the total square feet from medium shirts is 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.

Large t-shirts are 6 square feet each, and Octavia has 6 of them. So, the total square feet from large shirts is 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

Now, let's add the total square feet from each type of shirt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

The final answer is: 101"
"Hello there. Let's calculate the total number of sunflower seeds. 

First, we need to find the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

Now, let's find the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. Then, we add this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

To find the total number of seeds, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that George has 18 pens. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has by multiplying 18 by 3. 

18 * 3 = 54

Now, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we divide the number of pens Timothy has by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Albert is 36"" tall, and Anne is twice the size of Albert. To find Anne's height, we multiply Albert's height by 2.

Anne's height = 2 * 36"" = 72""

Now, we know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne. To find Jackie's height, we subtract 2"" from Anne's height.

Jackie's height = 72"" - 2"" = 70""

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before summer.

Jackie's height before summer = 70"" - 3"" = 67""

The final answer is: 67"
"To find out how much money the company receives for selling the produced chocolate bars, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

In one day, the company produces 5000 bars. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, the company produces 5000 * 7 = 35000 bars.

In two weeks, the company produces 35000 * 2 = 70000 bars.

The price per bar is $2. So, the total money the company receives is 70000 * 2 = $140000.

The final answer is: $140000"
"I'd be happy to help you with Jake's shopping trip. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, but there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, he only pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"Let's break down Ryan's situation. He earns $6 each week he completes his chores, and he did his chores for 3 weeks. So, his total allowance is 6 * 3 = $18.

Next, he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Since there are 4 people in total, the cost of the ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total allowance: $18 - $5 = $13.

Finally, we need to find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy. Each ticket costs $6.50, so we'll divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's calculate the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani at the mall.

Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. To find the total amount she spent, we add these two costs together: $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani purchased a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. We multiply the cost of the bathrobes by 2 to find the total cost of the bathrobes: $100 x 2 = $200. Then, we add the cost of the sunglasses to this total: $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, we add the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani to find the overall total: $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"To find the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of making one jar and then multiply it by 10.

The cost of making one jar is:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

The selling price of one jar is $50.

The profit from one jar is: $50 - $44 = $6

The profit from 10 jars is: $6 * 10 = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's calculate the total dollar amount in the jar. 

First, we need to find the value of each type of coin. 
- 32 quarters = 32 x $0.25 = $8
- 95 dimes = 95 x $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 x $0.05 = $6
- 750 pennies = 750 x $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together:
$8 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31

"Hello, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Josh runs a car shop and services 3 cars a day. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. He gets paid $4 per car. To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday) and not open 2 days a week (Sunday and Wednesday). So, he is open 5 days a week.

In 1 week, Josh is open 5 days, so he services 5 * 3 = 15 cars.

In 2 weeks, Josh is open 10 days, so he services 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 2 weeks, he makes 30 * $4 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the situation with Randy and his cookies. He starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. That's a total of 18 cookies.

Randy then eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This means he's down to 18 - 3 = 15 cookies.

Next, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, leaving him with 9 - 2 = 7 oatmeal cookies. He still has 4 chocolate chip cookies and 5 sugar cookies. So, the total number of cookies now is 7 + 4 + 5 = 16.

Randy then gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, leaving him with 5 - 2 = 3 sugar cookies. The total number of cookies now is 7 + 4 + 3 = 14.

Finally, Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. This adds 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies to his collection.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:
Total cookies initially = 18
Cookies eaten or given away = 3 (snack) + 2 (lunch) + 2 (given away) = 7
Cookies baked = 12

Total cookies now = Total cookies initially - Cookies eaten or given away + Cookies baked
Total cookies now = 18 - 7 + 12
Total cookies now = 23

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with Matthew's toy soldier dilemma. 

To find out how much Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of his collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, he can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30.

For the second half, he would get 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.

To find the total amount, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of holes dug by the dog. Since the dog digs 6 holes a day and Nate was on vacation for 14 days, we multiply the number of holes dug per day by the number of days.

Holes dug per day = 6
Days Nate was on vacation = 14
Total holes dug = 6 * 14 = 84

However, the dog also digs 6 new holes every night. Since we don't know how many days Nate fills the holes, we'll assume he fills the holes for the same number of days he was on vacation. So, we add the holes dug at night to the total holes dug during the day.

Holes dug at night = 6 * 14 = 84
Total holes = 84 + 84 = 168

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. He fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

Days to fill holes = Total holes / Net holes filled per day
Days to fill holes = 168 / 3
Days to fill holes = 56

Since we need to find the number of weeks, we'll divide the total days by 7.

Weeks to fill holes = Days to fill holes / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 56 / 7
Weeks to fill holes = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4 to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Average enrollment at Norman High School: 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School: 4000 * (3/4) = 3000 students

Now, we can find the difference in enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in enrollment: 4000 - 3000 = 1000

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"Let's figure out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made. We know they've made a total of 7995 cookies, and they have 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they've made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total.

First, let's add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies together: 2595 + 3075 = 5670.

Now, let's subtract that number from the total number of cookies: 7995 - 5670 = 2325.

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: This means he gathered 12 Petri dishes, since 14 - 2 = 12.
- Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers: 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 12 Petri dishes = 27 items.

Since Igor had 29 items on the lab bench, he must have lost 29 - 27 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. James is putting together 4 tables, and each table has 4 legs. Since each leg needs 2 screws, we need to find out how many screws are required for all the legs.

First, we calculate the total number of legs: 4 tables * 4 legs per table = 16 legs.

Next, we calculate the total number of screws needed for the legs: 16 legs * 2 screws per leg = 32 screws.

Now, we know James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"Let's count the eggs. We have 10 eggs in the first basket. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, we need to multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2 to find the number of eggs in the second basket.

So, 10 eggs * 2 = 20 eggs in the second basket.

Now, let's add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.

The final answer is: 30"
"I'm Fatima, and I'm happy to help the girls calculate the total amount of money they raised for the carnival.

Let's start by figuring out how much each girl raised. Alexandra raised $430. Since Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, Kim must have raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Next, we know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300. So, Maryam must have raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes, Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x minutes.

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran half the distance of Vanessa (since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron), we can set up the equation:

x * 2 = 16 (since Aaron ran half the distance of Vanessa, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 16 / 2
x = 8

Now that we know Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile:
Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. 

Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3: 
200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

He already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total amount needed: 
600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"Let's calculate the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant. They get 6 reservations a night and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5) + $5 (bottle of wine) = (2 * $5) + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15
Daily revenue = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days they are open.

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * Number of days open = $15 * 2 = $30

"Hello there. I'd be happy to help you with your question. 

To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to first determine the total amount of money the fruit vendor made from selling all 50 watermelons. Since he sold them at a 25% profit, the selling price is 125% of the cost price.

The cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Let's find the cost price of 1 watermelon: 
Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

Now, let's find the selling price of 1 watermelon:
Selling price of 50 watermelons = 125% of $80
Selling price of 50 watermelons = (125/100) * $80 = $100
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Hello, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Now, we need to find John's current age. We know that John had James when he was 19, so the time that has passed since then is 18 years. Therefore, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so his youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, his age will be 5 + 3 = 8 years.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange, and Jane takes 4 minutes to do the same. 

To find out how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour, we need to divide the total minutes in an hour (60) by the time it takes each of them to peel an orange.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane. The difference is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, let's start with the cost of the radiator. Mark gets it at a junk shop for 80% off the original price of $400. 

The discount amount is 400 * 0.8 = $320.
The cost of the radiator after the discount is 400 - 320 = $80.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 * 50 = $150.

The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost, which is 80 + 150 = $230.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of animals on Farmer Brown's farm is 20, and they are all either chickens or cows. We also know that the total number of legs is 70.

Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can set up the following equation: 2C + 4W = 70.

We also know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can set up another equation: C + W = 20.

Now, let's solve the second equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Substituting this expression for W into the first equation, we get 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

So, the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
