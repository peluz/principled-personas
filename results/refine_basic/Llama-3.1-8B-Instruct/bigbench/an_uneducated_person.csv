"Let's figure this out. 

We got four houses, and each one's got a different person in it. Each person's got different flowers and plays a different instrument. 

We know the flutist lives in the second house. That's a start.

Now, we got a clue that says the person with tulips lives next to the guitarist. That means the guitarist can't be in the first house, 'cause the flutist is in the second house. So, the guitarist's gotta be in the third house.

Now, we got another clue that says the person with lilies lives next to the person with carnations. That means they gotta be next to each other, but we don't know which one's on the left.

We also got a clue that says there's one house between the flutist and the pianist. That means the pianist's gotta be in the fourth house.

Now, let's put it all together. The flutist's in the second house, the pianist's in the fourth house, and the guitarist's in the third house. That means the person with tulips has gotta be in the first house.

So, the answer is (C) 1."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, we know the person who likes green lives in the first house. That's clue 5. Then, we know the person who eats kiwis lives in the first house too, from clue 8. So, the person who likes green must be eating kiwis.

Now, clue 6 says the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. That means they can't be in the first house, 'cause the person who likes green is already there. So, they must be in the second and third houses.

Clue 7 says the percussionist ain't in the second house. That means the percussionist must be in the first house.

Clue 4 says there's one house between the cellist and the person with a gameboy. That means the cellist can't be in the first house, 'cause the percussionist is already there. And the person with a gameboy can't be in the second house, 'cause the cellist has to be between them. So, the cellist must be in the second house.

Now, clue 2 says the person with a TV lives to the left of the root beer lover. That means the person with a TV must be in the first house.

Clue 3 says the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the root beer lover. That means the person who only drinks water must be in the first house too.

Clue 1 says the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who eats grapes. That means the person who eats grapes must be in the second house.

Clue 6 says the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. That means the person who likes blue must be in the second house, and the person who has a gameboy must be in the third house.

- Golfer in the first house
- ? in the second house
- ? in the third house
- Romance book lover in the fourth house

The mystery book reader lives next to the history book buff. That means the history book buff can't be in the fourth house, 'cause the romance book lover's already there. So, the history book buff's gotta be in the third house, and the mystery book reader's gotta be in the second house.

Now we got this: 
- Golfer in the first house
- Mystery book reader in the second house
- History book buff in the third house
- Romance book lover in the fourth house

The basketball player can't be in the fourth house. That's what the clues say. So, the basketball player's gotta be in the first or second house. But the first house is already taken by the golfer, so the basketball player's gotta be in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"So, let's figure this out. We got four houses, and each person is different. They like different kinds of books, and they wear different shoes. We gotta find out where the mystery book reader lives.

We know the person wearin' high heels ain't in the second house. That's clue number one. And the history book buff lives to the right of the person wearin' loafers. That's clue number two.

Now, the mystery book reader lives in the third house. That's clue number three. So, we got that one figured out.

The person wearin' high heels can't be in the fourth house neither. That's clue number four. And the person wearin' sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover. That's clue number five.

So, if the person wearin' sandals lives in the first house, then the romance book lover lives in the second house. And the person wearin' high heels can't be in the second house, so they must be in the fourth house.

Now, the history book buff lives to the right of the person wearin' loafers. If the person wearin' loafers is in the first house, then the history book buff is in the fourth house. But we already said the person wearin' high heels is in the fourth house. So, the person wearin' loafers can't be in the first house.

That means the person wearin' loafers must be in the third house. But we already said the mystery book reader lives in the third house. So, the person wearin' loafers must be in the first house, and the history book buff must be in the fourth house.

So, the order of the houses is:
- House 1: person wearin' loafers
- House 2: romance book lover, person wearin' sandals
- House 3: mystery book reader
- House 4: person wearin' high heels, history book buff

The mystery book reader lives in the third house, so the answer is:

(B) 3"
"Let's figure dis out. 

From clue 1, we know the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. 

From clue 2, we know the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.

So, the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house, and the person who has a computer lives in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. 

Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who likes yellow must live in the third house.

The person who has a phone must live in the second house, as it is the only remaining option.

So, the order of the houses from left to right is: green, phone, yellow, gameboy, computer.

But wait, the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. This means the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house and the person who has a computer lives in the third house.

The correct order of the houses from left to right is: green, computer, phone, yellow, gameboy.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's figure this out. We got four houses, and each one's got a person in it. They all like different things: colors, drinks, and books.

We know the person who likes white lives in one of the houses, and the coffee drinker lives in one of the houses too. There's two houses between the person who likes white and the coffee drinker.

The person who likes green lives in the fourth house. That's a fact. The root beer lover lives in the third house. I know this 'cause it's said so.

Now, the history book buff don't live in the fourth house. That's clue number three. And the romance book lover don't live in the first house. That's clue number four.

The person who likes red lives in the third house. That's clue number seven. But we already know the root beer lover lives in the third house, and the person who likes red lives in the third house too. So, the person who likes red must be the root beer lover.

Now, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. That's clue number eight. So, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

But wait, the history book buff can't be in the first house 'cause the person who likes green lives in the fourth house, and there's two houses between the person who likes white and the coffee drinker. So, the history book buff must be in the second house, and the romance book lover must be in the first house.

The tea drinker don't live in the second house. That's clue number nine. So, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.

Now, the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green. That's clue number two. But we already know the person who likes green lives in the fourth house. So, the coffee drinker must live in the third house.

The answer is (D)."
"Let's figure this out. 

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all got different stuff: one's got a phone, one's got a radio. They all like different kinds of books: one likes mystery books, one likes fantasy books. They all ate different food for lunch: one had pizza, one had spaghetti. They all like different colors: one likes green, one likes yellow. And they all got different pets: one likes cats, one likes fish.

Now, let's see what we know. The person who likes green lives next to the person who's got a radio. The person who likes fantasy books lives in the first house. The person who likes fish doesn't live in the first house. And the person who had pizza doesn't live in the first house.

So, the person who likes fantasy books lives in the first house. The person who likes green lives next to the person who's got a radio, so the person who likes green must live in the second house. The person who likes fish can't live in the first house, so they must live in the second house. And the person who had pizza can't live in the first house, so they must live in the second house too.

Now we got this:
- House 1: Radio, Fantasy book, ?, ?, ?
- House 2: ?, ?, Fish, Pizza, Green, ?

The person in the first house must like yellow, 'cause the person in the second house likes green. And the person in the first house must like cats, 'cause the person in the second house likes fish.

So, the cat lover lives in the first house. The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure this out. 

From clue 4, the dog owner lives in the second house. 

From clue 14, the dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the dog owner is in the second house, the person who likes red must be in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who had stew does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in the first house.

From clue 17, the tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white cannot be in the first house (because the person who had stew is in the first house), the person who likes white must be in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is taken by the person who likes milk. So, the person who likes white must be in the fifth house, and the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.

From clue 12, the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes red is in the third house, the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza must be in the fourth and fifth houses, respectively.

From clue 13, there are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives. Since the person who had pizza is in the fifth house, the person who owns horses must be in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who owns horses is in the first house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house. However, the second house is taken by the dog owner. So, the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house, and the dog owner must be in the second house is incorrect. The dog owner is in the second house, the person who ate fried rice is in the third house, and the person who owns horses is in the first house.

From clue 2, the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in the first house (because the person who owns horses is in the first house), the person who likes blue must be in the fifth house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house.

From clue 9, the root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes blue is in the fifth house, the romance book lover must be in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is taken by the person who likes milk. So, the person who likes milk and the romance book lover must be in the third and fourth houses, respectively, and the person who likes blue must be in the fifth house is incorrect. The person who likes blue is in the fifth house, the person who likes milk is in the fourth house, and the romance book lover is in the third house.

From clue 8, the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who likes milk is in the fourth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fifth house.

From clue 5, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is taken by the person who likes milk. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house is incorrect. The person who ate spaghetti is in the fourth house, and the person who likes milk is in the fifth house is incorrect. The person who ate spaghetti is in the fourth house, and the person who likes milk is in the third house is incorrect.

"Let's figure this out. 

We know there's a person in each house, and they all got different stuff. One's a bird keeper, one's a fish enthusiast, one owns horses, and one's a cat lover. They all like different drinks too: tea, root beer, water, and milk. And they all eat different fruits: oranges, mangos, apples, and kiwis. They all play different instruments: violin, flute, guitar, and cello.

From clue 8, we know the person who eats kiwis lives in the first house. And from clue 13, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. So, the person who eats kiwis must be the cat lover.

From clue 12, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who eats kiwis. Since the person who eats kiwis lives in the first house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

From clue 6, we know the person who likes milk can't live in the first house, and from clue 7, we know they can't live in the third house. So, the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

From clue 10, we know the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must live in the third and fourth houses.

From clue 1, we know the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the cellist. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the fish enthusiast must live in the third house, and the cellist must live in the fourth house.

From clue 11, we know the person who eats oranges can't live in the second house. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who eats oranges must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know there's one house between where the person who eats apples lives and where the person who eats oranges lives. Since the person who eats oranges lives in the fourth house, the person who eats apples must live in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the flutist lives in the first house. Since the cat lover lives in the first house, the flutist must be the cat lover, which is the person who eats kiwis.

So, the person who eats kiwis lives in the first house. That's answer (A)."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each house got a person in it. Each person is eatin' somethin' different, and they all got different flowers in their foyer. We gotta figure out who's eatin' what and who's got which flowers.

Let's start with the person who's got a rose bouquet. Clue 1 says they live left of the person who ate grilled cheese. That's a good start.

Now, let's think about the person who's eatin' oranges. Clue 2 says they live left of the person who's eatin' apples. That's a good clue.

Clue 3 says the person who's got a vase of tulips don't live in the fifth house. That's a good clue.

Clue 4 says the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live next to each other. That's a good clue.

Clue 5 says the person who's got a bouquet of daffodils don't live in the fifth house. That's a good clue.

Clue 6 says the person who had pizza lives left of the person who ate grilled cheese. That's a good clue.

Clue 7 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives right of the person who ate spaghetti. That's a good clue.

Clue 8 says the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who's got a vase of tulips live next to each other. That's a good clue.

Clue 9 says there's two houses between the person who's eatin' oranges and the person who's eatin' kiwis. That's a good clue.

Clue 10 says the person who's eatin' oranges lives right of the person who's got a carnations arrangement. That's a good clue.

Clue 11 says the person who's eatin' apples lives left of the person who's eatin' mangos. That's a good clue.

Okay, so let's start with the person who's got a rose bouquet. They live left of the person who ate grilled cheese. That means they gotta live in the first house.

Now, let's think about the person who had pizza. Clue 6 says they live left of the person who ate grilled cheese. That means they gotta live in the second house.

Now, let's think about the person who ate grilled cheese. Clue 7 says they live right of the person who ate spaghetti. Clue 8 says they live next to the person who's got a vase of tulips. Clue 4 says they live next to the person who had stew. That means they gotta live in the fourth house.

Now, let's think about the person who's got a vase of tulips. Clue 8 says they live next to the person who ate grilled cheese. That means they gotta live in the third house.

Now, let's think about the person who had stew. Clue 4 says they live next to the person who ate grilled cheese. That means they gotta live in the third house.

Wait, we already said the person who's got a vase of tulips lives in the third house. That means the person who had stew can't live in the third house.

Let's try again. Clue 3 says the person who's got a vase of tulips don't live in the fifth house. Clue 5 says the person who's got a bouquet of daffodils don't live in the fifth house. That means the person who's got a vase of tulips and the person who's got a bouquet of daffodils gotta live in the first, second, third, or fourth house.

Clue 8 says the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who's got a vase of tulips live next to each other. That means the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who's got a vase of tulips gotta live in the same house.

Clue 4 says the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live next to each other. That means the person who had stew and the person who's got a vase of tulips gotta live in the same house.

That means the person who's got a vase of tulips, the person who ate grilled cheese, and the person who had stew gotta live in the same house. That means the person who's got a bouquet of daffodils gotta live in the fifth house.

Clue 11 says the person who's eatin' apples lives left of the person who's eatin' mangos. Clue 10 says the person who's eatin' oranges lives right of the person who's got a carnations arrangement. Clue 9 says there's two houses between the person who's eatin' oranges and the person who's eatin' kiwis. That means the person who's eatin' oranges lives in the first house, the person who's got a carnations arrangement lives in the second house, the person who's eatin' kiwis lives in the fifth house, and the person who's eatin' apples lives in the third house.

Clue 7 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives right of the person who ate spaghetti. Clue 6 says the person who had pizza lives left of the person who ate grilled cheese. That means the person who had pizza lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.

Clue 4 says the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live next to each other. That means the person who had stew lives in the third house.

So, the person who had stew lives in the third house.

The answer is (E)."
"Let's figure this out. 

We got four houses, and each one's got a different pet and a different kind of flowers. We gotta find out who's got the fish.

First, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. That's a given.

Now, the person with tulips lives to the left of the dog owner. That means the dog owner can't be in the first house, 'cause the cat lover's already there. So, the dog owner's gotta be in the second house.

The person with daffodils can't be in the second house, 'cause that's where the dog owner is. So, the person with daffodils must be in the fourth house.

Now, there's one house between the person who owns horses and the person with carnations. That means the person with carnations can't be in the second house, 'cause there's no house between the second and the fourth. So, the person with carnations must be in the fourth house, but we already said that's where the person with daffodils is. That means the person with carnations must be in the third house, and the person with daffodils is in the fourth house.

The person with lilies lives to the right of the person who owns horses. That means the person with lilies can't be in the first house, 'cause the cat lover's there. And it can't be in the second house, 'cause that's where the dog owner is. So, the person with lilies must be in the third house, but we already said that's where the person with carnations is. That means the person with lilies must be in the third house, and the person with carnations is in the fourth house.

Now we got this:
- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Person with lilies
- House 4: Person with carnations

The only one left is the fish enthusiast. That means the fish enthusiast must be in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"So, let's figure this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all got different stuff: one's wearin' boots, one's wearin' high heels, one's got a horse, one's got a dog, one's got a radio, and one's got a phone.

We know the person with the phone lives in the first house. That's clue number one.

Clue number two says the person wearin' boots don't live in the second house. That means they must live in the first house. But wait, we already said the person in the first house has a phone. So, the person in the first house can't be wearin' boots. That means the person in the first house must be wearin' high heels.

Clue number three says the person with the horse and the person with the radio live next to each other. Since the person in the first house is wearin' high heels, the person in the second house must be the one with the horse and the radio.

So, the person wearin' high heels lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got three houses, and three people in 'em. Each person's got different shoes, favorite color, food, and device. We gotta figure out who's who.

Clue 1 says the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who's got a computer live next to each other. That's a good start.

Clue 2 says the person who ate grilled cheese don't live in the third house. That means they gotta live in the first or second house.

Clue 3 says the person who's eating apples don't live in the first house. That means they gotta live in the second or third house.

Clue 4 says the person who's eating grapes lives to the right of the person who's wearing boots. That's a good clue.

Clue 5 says there's one house between the person who likes blue and the person who's got a phone. That's a good clue too.

Clue 6 says the person who's wearing loafers don't live in the third house. That's a good clue.

Clue 7 says the person who had pizza don't live in the second house. That means they gotta live in the first or third house.

Clue 8 says the person who's eating mangos lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. That's a good clue.

Clue 9 says the person who's wearing loafers and the person who's got a computer live next to each other. That's a good clue.

Clue 10 says the person who's got a computer lives to the left of the person who's got a phone. That's a good clue.

Okay, let's start with clue 9. If the person who's wearing loafers and the person who's got a computer live next to each other, and the person who's got a computer lives to the left of the person who's got a phone, that means the order of the houses is: computer, loafers, phone.

Now, let's look at clue 1. If the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who's got a computer live next to each other, and the person who's got a computer is in the first house, that means the person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house.

But wait, clue 2 says the person who ate grilled cheese don't live in the third house. That's already satisfied.

Now, let's look at clue 3. If the person who's eating apples don't live in the first house, and the person who's got a computer is in the first house, that means the person who's eating apples is in the second house.

But wait, clue 1 says the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who's got a computer live next to each other. That means the person who's eating apples can't be in the second house.

So, let's try again. If the person who's got a computer is in the second house, that means the person who ate grilled cheese is in the first house.

Now, let's look at clue 3. If the person who's eating apples don't live in the first house, and the person who's got a computer is in the second house, that means the person who's eating apples is in the third house.

Now, let's look at clue 4. If the person who's eating grapes lives to the right of the person who's wearing boots, and the person who's got a computer is in the second house, that means the person who's wearing boots is in the first house.

But wait, clue 6 says the person who's wearing loafers don't live in the third house. That means the person who's wearing boots can't be in the first house.

So, let's try again. If the person who's wearing boots is in the third house, that means the person who's eating grapes is in the second house.

Now, let's look at clue 5. If there's one house between the person who likes blue and the person who's got a phone, and the person who's got a computer is in the second house, that means the person who likes blue is in the first house.

Now, let's look at clue 8. If the person who's eating mangos lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, and the person who's got a computer is in the second house, that means the person who likes yellow is in the third house.

Now, let's look at clue 7. If the person who had pizza don't live in the second house, and the person who's got a computer is in the second house, that means the person who had pizza is in the first house.

But wait, clue 1 says the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who's got a computer live next to each other. That means the person who had pizza can't be in the first house.

So, let's try again. If the person who had pizza is in the third house, that means the person who's eating mangos is in the second house.

Now, let's look at clue 9. If the person who's wearing loafers and the person who's got a computer live next to each other, and the person who's got a computer is in the second house, that means the person who's wearing loafers is in the first house.

Now, let's look at clue 10. If the person who's got a computer lives to the left of the person who's got a phone, and the person who's got a computer is in the second house, that means the person who's got a phone is in the third house.

Now, let's put it all together. The order of the houses is: boots, computer, loafers, phone.

The person who's eating grapes is in the second house, the person who's eating apples is in the third house, the person who's eating mangos is in the first house, the person who likes blue is in the first house, the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who had pizza is in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house, the person who's wearing loafers is in the first house, the person who's wearing boots is in the third house, the person who's got a computer is in the second house, and the person who's got a phone is in the third house.

The person who likes green is in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure this out. 

We got four houses, and each one's got a different person in it. They all do different sports, and they all got different pets. The sports are swimming, tennis, baseball, and basketball. The pets are birds, fish, dogs, and cats.

We got some clues to help us out. 

1. The basketball player ain't in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper ain't in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives to the left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper ain't in the third house.

Let's start with clue 3. The baseball player's in the second house. That's a good start.

Now, from clue 1, the basketball player can't be in the first house. That means the basketball player's in the second, third, or fourth house. But wait, the baseball player's already in the second house, so the basketball player's gotta be in the third or fourth house.

From clue 2, the basketball player's to the left of the swimmer. That means the basketball player's in the third house, and the swimmer's in the fourth house.

Now, from clue 4, the fish enthusiast's to the right of the dog owner. That means the dog owner's in the first house, and the fish enthusiast's in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the bird keeper ain't in the first house. That means the bird keeper's in the second, third, or fourth house.

From clue 7, the bird keeper ain't in the third house. That means the bird keeper's in the second or fourth house.

Now, from clue 6, the tennis player's to the left of the cat lover. That means the tennis player's in the first house, and the cat lover's in the second house. But wait, we already said the bird keeper's in the second house. That means the bird keeper's in the second house.

So, the bird keeper's in the second house. That's the answer.

The correct answer is (A)."
"Let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people in 'em. Each person likes a different color: white, blue, or yellow. Each person drives a different kind of car: a convertible, an SUV, or a sedan. Each person plays a different instrument: a violin, a guitar, or a saxophone. Each person has a different device: a computer, a TV, or a gameboy. And each person plays a different sport: baseball, swimming, or soccer.

Clue 1: The person who likes white lives to the right of the person with a computer.

Clue 2: There's one house between the baseball player and the person who likes blue.

Clue 3: The person with a sedan lives left of the person with an SUV.

Clue 4: The swimmer lives to the right of the person with an SUV.

Clue 5: The violinist don't live in the first house.

Clue 6: The person with a sedan and the person with a gameboy live next to each other.

Clue 7: The guitarist lives to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start with clue 3. If the person with a sedan lives left of the person with an SUV, that means the order is either 1-2 or 2-3. But clue 6 says the person with a sedan and the person with a gameboy live next to each other. So, the person with a sedan must live in house 1, and the person with a gameboy must live in house 2.

Now, clue 3 says the person with a sedan lives left of the person with an SUV. So, the person with an SUV must live in house 2. But clue 4 says the swimmer lives to the right of the person with an SUV. So, the swimmer must live in house 3.

Now, let's look at clue 2. It says there's one house between the baseball player and the person who likes blue. Since the person with a computer lives in house 1, the baseball player must live in house 3, and the person who likes blue must live in house 2.

Clue 7 says the guitarist lives to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes blue lives in house 2, the person who likes white must live in house 1.

Clue 1 says the person who likes white lives to the right of the person with a computer. This is consistent with our current arrangement.

Now, let's look at clue 5. It says the violinist don't live in the first house. Since the person with a computer lives in house 1, the violinist must live in either house 2 or 3. But we already know the person who likes blue lives in house 2, so the violinist must live in house 3.

So, the order is: house 1 - person with a computer, house 2 - person with a gameboy, house 3 - person with a sedan.

Now, let's figure out the rest. The person with a sedan lives in house 3, so the person with an SUV lives in house 2. The swimmer lives in house 3, so the baseball player lives in house 1.

The person who likes white lives in house 1, so the person who likes blue lives in house 2. The guitarist lives to the right of the person who likes white, so the guitarist lives in house 3.

"Let's figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each house got a different person with different stuff. We gotta find out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

From clue 11, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.

From clue 10, we know the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

From clue 9, we know the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the fish enthusiast, so the fish enthusiast lives in the second house.
- The person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who had stew, so the person who had stew lives in the fourth house, the person who ate fried rice lives in the fifth house, and the person who has a computer lives in the third house.
- The person who has a computer lives in the third house, but the cat lover lives in the third house, so the person who has a computer can't live in the third house. That means the person who has a computer lives in the second house is not possible because the fish enthusiast lives in the second house. The person who has a computer lives in the fourth house is not possible because the person who had stew lives in the fourth house. The person who has a computer lives in the fifth house is not possible because the person who ate fried rice lives in the fifth house.

"Let's figure this out. 

First, we know there's a pianist, a violinist, and a percussionist. They live in houses 1, 2, and 3. We also know they're eatin' different fruits: oranges, bananas, and kiwis. And they're wearin' different shoes: high heels, running shoes, and boots. Plus, they all got different devices: a TV, a phone, and a radio.

From what I know, the pianist ain't in the first house. That's clue number one. 

Now, let's think about the person eatin' oranges. They live to the right of the person eatin' kiwis. That's clue number two. 

Clue number three says the person wearin' high heels and the pianist live next to each other. That means they can't be in the first house, 'cause the pianist ain't there. So, they must be in the second or third house.

Clue number four says the person wearin' running shoes and the percussionist live next to each other. That's a good clue. 

Clue number five says the person eatin' kiwis lives to the left of the person wearin' boots. That means the person eatin' kiwis must be in the first house.

Clue number six says the person with a radio lives to the left of the person wearin' high heels. That means the person with a radio must be in the first house.

Clue number seven says the person eatin' oranges lives to the left of the person with a TV. That means the person with a TV must be in the second or third house.

Now, let's put it all together. The person eatin' kiwis is in the first house. The person with a radio is in the first house. The person wearin' high heels and the pianist must be in the second house. The person eatin' oranges is in the second house, 'cause they live to the right of the person eatin' kiwis. The person with a TV must be in the third house, 'cause the person eatin' oranges lives to the left of them.

So, the person with a TV lives in the third house. The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's figure dis out. We got 5 houses, and each house got a person in it. Each person got a car, a drink, a fruit, and a favorite color. We gotta figure out who lives in which house.

Clue 1 says the tea drinker don't live in the first house. Clue 2 says the person eatin' apples lives in the third house. Clue 3 says the person who likes red don't live in the third house. Clue 4 says the person who likes milk and the person who eats a banana live next to each other. Clue 5 says the person who only drinks water lives next to the person who likes yellow. Clue 6 says there's two houses between the root beer lover and the person who eats kiwis. Clue 7 says the person who likes milk lives in the third house. Clue 8 says the person who owns an SUV lives to the right of the person who likes milk. Clue 9 says the person who likes red lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. Clue 10 says the person who drives a convertible lives to the left of the person who likes red. Clue 11 says the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. Clue 12 says the person who eats mangos lives to the left of the person who likes green. Clue 13 says the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live next to each other.

Okay, so the person who likes milk lives in the third house. That's clue 7. The person who eats a banana lives next to the person who likes milk, so they live in the second house. The person who only drinks water lives next to the person who likes yellow, and the person who likes red lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. So, the person who likes red lives in the first house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. But wait, the person who eats a banana lives in the second house, so the person who only drinks water must live in the first house. That means the person who likes red lives in the second house, but that can't be right because the person who eats a banana lives in the second house. So, the person who likes red lives in the first house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the second house.

The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live next to each other. The person who likes yellow can't live in the first house because the person who only drinks water lives there, so the person who owns a sedan lives in the second house.

The person who owns an SUV lives to the right of the person who likes milk, so they live in the fourth or fifth house. The person who eats kiwis lives two houses to the right of the person who drinks root beer, and the person who eats mangos lives one house to the left of the person who likes green. The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Let's try to put it all together. The person who likes red lives in the first house, the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who owns a sedan lives in the second house, the person who likes milk lives in the third house, the person who eats a banana lives in the second house, the person who eats apples lives in the third house, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house, the person who eats kiwis lives in the fifth house, the person who eats mangos lives in the fourth house, the person who likes blue lives in the third house, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house, the person who drives a truck lives in the fifth house, the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, the person who drinks root beer lives in the fourth house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the second house.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in the second house. That's option (B)."
"So, let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people, and they all got different cars and eat different fruits. 

One person drives a truck, one drives a convertible, and one drives an SUV. One person eats a banana, one eats mangos, and one eats kiwis. 

Now, let's see what we know. The person who drives a truck don't live in the third house. The person who owns an SUV don't live in the third house. The person who drives a truck don't live in the first house. The person who eats a banana don't live in the second house. And the person who eats kiwis lives in the first house.

So, the person who eats kiwis lives in the first house. That means the person in the first house ain't eating a banana, 'cause that's what the person in the second house is eating. And the person in the first house ain't driving a truck, 'cause that's what the person in the third house is driving.

Now, let's think about the second house. The person in the second house is eating mangos, and they ain't driving a truck or a convertible. That means they must be driving an SUV. 

So, the person who owns an SUV lives in the second house. That's the answer."
"So, there's three houses, right? And three people in 'em. Each person ate somethin' different: spaghetti, stew, and fried rice. And they all play different sports: swimmin', cricket, and tennis.

Now, let's figure this out. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. That's a fact. The person who ate spaghetti lives right next to the person who ate fried rice, on the left. So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

The swimmer lives in the first house. That's all we know about that. Now, the cricketer can't live in the third house, 'cause that's where the fried rice person lives. So, the cricketer must live in either the first or the second house. But the swimmer's already in the first house, so the cricketer must live in the second house. That means the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house. That's the answer."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each person's got a different car, favorite color, and shoes. We gotta figure out who lives in which house.

Okay, so the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house. That's a good start.

Now, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. That's good too.

We know the person who owns an SUV don't live in the first house. That's all we know about the SUV.

Now, let's think about the person who's wearin' boots. We know they live to the left of the person who drives a truck. And the person who drives a truck lives to the left of the person who's wearin' sandals. So, the person who's wearin' boots must live in the first house.

Now, the person who's wearin' loafers lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. So, the person who's wearin' loafers must live in the second house.

The person who drives a truck lives in the second house, and the person who's wearin' sandals lives in the third house.

Now, we got a problem. We know there's one house between the person who likes green and the person who drives a truck. And the person who drives a truck lives in the second house. So, the person who likes green must live in the third house. But wait, we already said the person who's wearin' sandals lives in the third house. This don't make sense.

Let's try again. The person who's wearin' boots lives in the first house. The person who's wearin' loafers lives in the second house. The person who drives a truck lives in the second house, but that's a problem. We said the person who's wearin' sandals lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. So, the person who's wearin' sandals must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the third house.

Now, we got a problem. We said the person who's wearin' boots lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. But we said the person who drives a truck lives in the third house. So, the person who's wearin' boots must live in the first house, and the person who's wearin' sandals must live in the second house.

The person who's wearin' sandals lives in the second house, and the person who drives a truck lives in the third house. The person who's wearin' boots lives in the first house.

Now, we know the person who likes green lives one house to the left of the person who drives a truck.

"So, let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people, and they all like different kinds of books. One likes fantasy, one likes history, and one likes science fiction. And they all ate different stuff for lunch: stew, pizza, and fried rice.

Now, let's look at the clues. Clue 1 says there's one house between the history book person and the stew eater. Clue 2 says the history book person lives in the first house. Clue 3 says there's one house between the pizza eater and the stew eater. Clue 4 says the fantasy book person lives in the second house.

So, if the history book person is in the first house, and there's one house between them and the stew eater, that means the stew eater can't be in the first house. And if the fantasy book person is in the second house, that means the pizza eater can't be in the second house either. 

Now, if the pizza eater is in the third house, that would mean the stew eater is in the second house, but that would mean there's no house between the pizza eater and the stew eater, which goes against clue 3. So, the pizza eater can't be in the third house.

That means the pizza eater must be in the second house, but we already know the fantasy book person is in the second house. So, the pizza eater can't be in the second house either.

This means the pizza eater must be in the first house, but we already know the history book person is in the first house. This can't be right.

Wait a minute... Clue 2 says the history book person is in the first house. Clue 3 says there's one house between the pizza eater and the stew eater. If the history book person is in the first house, and there's one house between the pizza eater and the stew eater, that means the pizza eater can't be in the first house. And if the fantasy book person is in the second house, that means the stew eater can't be in the second house either.

So, the stew eater must be in the third house. And if the stew eater is in the third house, that means the pizza eater is in the second house, and the history book person is in the first house.

So, the history book person lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."

"Let's figure this out. 

We got three houses, and three people. Each person is different. They all got different pets, they all play different sports, and they all got different cars.

Clue 1: The person who drives a truck lives to the right of the basketball player.

Clue 2: The cricketer lives in the first house.

Clue 3: The cat lover lives to the right of the person who owns a sedan.

Clue 4: The person who owns horses lives to the left of the person who owns a sedan.

Okay, so the cricketer is in the first house. That's clue 2. Now, the person who owns horses lives to the left of the person who owns a sedan. That means the person who owns horses can't be in the first house, 'cause the cricketer is there. So, the person who owns horses must be in the second house, and the person who owns a sedan must be in the third house.

Now, the cat lover lives to the right of the person who owns a sedan. That means the cat lover must be in the third house too. But wait, we already said the cat lover is in the third house. That's right.

Now, the person who drives a truck lives to the right of the basketball player. That means the basketball player can't be in the third house, 'cause the cat lover and the person who owns a sedan are there. So, the basketball player must be in the second house, and the person who drives a truck must be in the third house.

So, the basketball player lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each house got a different person with different stuff. We gotta find out where the person with a vase of tulips lives.

From clue 4, the person with a radio lives in the fourth house.

From clue 6, the dog owner don't live in the second house.

From clue 7, the person with a bouquet of daffodils don't live in the third house.

From clue 8, the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 9, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the person with a gameboy.

From clue 10, the person with a television don't live in the second house.

From clue 11, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 12, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 13, the guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.

From clue 14, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.

From clue 15, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

From clue 16, the person who has a rose bouquet don't live in the third house.

From clue 17, the pianist lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.

From clue 18, the percussionist lives directly left of the cat lover.

From clue 19, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.

From clue 1, there are two houses between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. This means the person who has a television lives in either the first or the third house, and the person who owns a sedan lives in either the third or the fifth house.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the person who has a computer lives and where the person who drives a truck lives. This means the person who has a computer lives in either the second or the fourth house, and the person who drives a truck lives in either the third or the fifth house.

From clue 3, the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.

From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

Now, let's think about it. If the person with a vase of tulips lives to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils don't live in the third house, then the person with a vase of tulips can't live in the third house. 

From clue 1, the person with a television lives in either the first or the third house, and the person who owns a sedan lives in either the third or the fifth house. If the person with a television lives in the third house, then the person with a vase of tulips can't live in the third house. 

So, the person with a vase of tulips must live in either the first or the fifth house. But if the person with a vase of tulips lives in the first house, then the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in the second house, which is not possible because the person with a bouquet of daffodils don't live in the second house. 

So, the person with a vase of tulips must live in the fifth house.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Let's figure this out. We got 4 houses, and each person is different. They all got different shoes, cars, food, and drinks.

From what I know, the person with running shoes lives in the second house. That's clue 7.

Now, the person with high heels can't live in the last house, 'cause that's clue 3. So, they gotta live in the first or third house.

Clue 2 says the person with loafers lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person with running shoes is in the second house, the person with loafers must be in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the third house.

Clue 4 says the person who likes milk lives in the third house. But wait, that's the same house as the person who ate grilled cheese. So, they're the same person.

Clue 5 says the person who likes root beer lives next to the person who owns an SUV. Since the person with running shoes is in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the last house, and the person who likes root beer must be in the third house.

But, we already know the person who likes milk lives in the third house. So, the person who owns an SUV is in the last house, and the person who likes root beer is in the third house.

Clue 1 says the person who likes root beer and the person who ate fried rice live next to each other. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the last house, the person who likes root beer is in the third house, and the person who ate fried rice is in the last house.

Clue 8 says the person who drives a convertible lives next to the person who only drinks water. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the last house, the person who only drinks water must be in the last house, and the person who drives a convertible must be in the third house.

But, we already know the person who owns an SUV is in the last house, and the person who likes root beer is in the third house. So, the person who drives a convertible must be in the third house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the last house.

Clue 6 says there are two houses between the person who owns a sedan and the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water is in the last house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 4 houses, and each person in 'em is different. They all like different drinks, wear different shoes, play different instruments, and ate different food.

From clue 1, the person wearin' sandals lives to the left of the person who likes milk. That's all I got from that one.

From clue 3, the saxophonist lives in the second house. That's a good start.

From clue 5, the cellist lives to the left of the tea drinker. That means the cellist can't be in the second house, 'cause the saxophonist is already there.

From clue 6, the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the person who wears loafers. That's a good clue.

From clue 7, the cellist lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. That means the cellist can't be in the second house, 'cause the saxophonist is already there.

From clue 8, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. That means the person who had pizza can't be in the first house, 'cause the saxophonist is in the second house.

From clue 9, the flutist don't live in the fourth house. That's a good clue.

From clue 10, the tea drinker lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's put it all together. The saxophonist is in the second house. The person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist, so the person who had pizza is in the third house. The cellist lives to the left of the tea drinker, and the tea drinker is in the fourth house, so the cellist is in the third house. But wait, the person who had pizza is already in the third house! That can't be right.

"Let's figure this out. 

We know the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house. That's clue 9. 

Now, clue 8 says the basketball player lives left of the person who drives a truck. That means the truck driver can't be in the first house, 'cause then the basketball player would be in the second house, and the minivan driver would be in the fourth house, but that's not possible 'cause the basketball player can't be in the second house if the truck driver is in the third house. 

So, the truck driver must be in the third house."
"Let's figure this out. 

We got three houses, and three people. Each person likes a different drink: water, coffee, and tea. Each person has a different car: a convertible, a sedan, and a minivan. Each person likes a different book: fantasy, science fiction, and history. And each person is eating a different fruit: apples, oranges, and mangos.

We know the tea drinker lives in the first house. That's a start.

Now, the person eating apples lives to the left of the person driving a minivan. That means the person eating apples is in the first house, and the person driving a minivan is in the third house.

The person driving a convertible lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. But if the person driving a minivan is in the third house, then the person driving a convertible can't be in the third house. So the person driving a convertible must be in the second house.

Now we got a problem. If the person driving a convertible is in the second house, then the person eating apples can't be in the first house. But we already said the person eating apples is in the first house. This means the person driving a convertible can't be in the second house. So the person driving a convertible must be in the third house, but that's not possible because the person driving a minivan is in the third house. This is a problem.

Wait, let me think about it some more. If the person eating apples is in the first house, and the person driving a minivan is in the third house, then the person eating oranges can't be in the second house. That's what the clue says.

So, there's three houses, right? And each house has a person in it. They all like different colors and different kinds of books. 

One person likes red, one likes yellow, and one likes white. And one person likes fantasy books, one likes romance books, and one likes mystery books.

From what I understand, the person who likes red lives in the second house. And the person who likes red lives right next to the person who likes mystery books. 

So, if the person who likes red lives in the second house, that means the person who likes mystery books lives in the third house. 

Now, the person who likes white can't live in the third house. So, that means the person who likes white must live in the first house. 

And the person who likes fantasy books can't live in the first house. So, that means the person who likes fantasy books must live in either the second or the third house.

"Let's figure this out. 

From clue 5, we know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house. That's a good start.

From clue 3, we know the person with daffodils lives to the left of the SUV owner. So, the person with daffodils must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person eating mangos lives to the left of the person driving a convertible. Since the person with daffodils lives in the second house, the person eating mangos must live in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives to the left of the person driving a convertible. But we already know the person eating mangos lives in the first house, so the person driving a convertible must live in the second house. But wait, we already said the person with daffodils lives in the second house. This means we gotta rethink this.

From clue 3, we know the person with daffodils lives to the left of the SUV owner. So, the person with daffodils must live in the first or second house.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives to the left of the person driving a convertible. Since the person eating mangos lives in the first house, the person driving a convertible must live in the second house. This means the person with daffodils must live in the first house.

From clue 9, we know the person driving a minivan and the history book buff live next to each other. Since the person with lilies lives to the left of the romance book lover (clue 10), the person driving a minivan and the history book buff must live in the first and second houses, or the second and third houses.

From clue 6, we know the person driving a minivan lives to the left of the dog owner. Since the person with daffodils lives in the first house, the person driving a minivan must live in the second house. This means the person with lilies must live in the third house.

From clue 10, we know the person with lilies lives to the left of the romance book lover. Since the person with lilies lives in the third house, the romance book lover must live in the fourth house.

From clue 11, we know the person with carnations lives to the left of the person eating grapes. Since the person with lilies lives in the third house, the person with carnations must live in the second house.

From clue 8, we know the bird keeper lives to the left of the person with carnations. Since the person with carnations lives in the second house, the bird keeper must live in the first house.

From clue 7, we know there's one house between the bird keeper and the person eating oranges. Since the bird keeper lives in the first house, the person eating oranges must live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person eating mangos lives to the left of the person driving a convertible. Since the person eating mangos lives in the first house, the person driving a convertible must live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives to the left of the person driving a convertible. Since the person driving a convertible lives in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the first house.

From clue 9, we know the person driving a minivan and the history book buff live next to each other. Since the person with lilies lives in the third house, the person driving a minivan must live in the second house. This means the history book buff must live in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person owning an SUV lives in the third house.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people. Each person is eatin' different fruits, got different flowers, plays different instruments, drinks different drinks, and got different devices.

From clue 1, the person with a TV lives left of the tea drinker. That means the person with a TV lives in the first house, and the tea drinker lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the person with a rose lives in the second house. That means the person with a rose lives in the second house.

From clue 4, the person with a TV lives left of the guitarist. That means the guitarist lives in the second house.

From clue 5, there's one house between the flutist and the person eatin' a banana. That means the flutist lives in the third house, and the person eatin' a banana lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the person eatin' kiwis lives right of the coffee drinker. That means the coffee drinker lives in the third house, and the person eatin' kiwis lives in the third house.

From clue 6, the person with tulips lives right of the person with a radio. That means the person with a radio lives in the first house, and the person with tulips lives in the third house.

Now we got this:

House 1: Person with a TV, person with a radio, person eatin' apples
House 2: Person with a rose, guitarist, person eatin' a banana

"Let's figure this out. 

From clue 7, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house. 

From clue 8, we know the person who eats a banana lives to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast, so they live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, we know the person who eats apples don't live in the third house, and since the person who eats a banana lives in the fourth house, the person who eats apples must live in the first or second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who wears running shoes lives directly left of the person who eats apples. Since the person who eats apples lives in the first or second house, the person who wears running shoes must live in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the person who eats mangos lives directly left of the person who wears sandals. Since the person who wears running shoes lives in the first house, the person who eats mangos must live in the second house, and the person who wears sandals must live in the third house.

From clue 6, we know there's one house between where the person who eats apples lives and where the person who wears boots lives. Since the person who eats apples lives in the first or second house, and the person who wears boots can't live in the first house, the person who eats apples must live in the second house, and the person who wears boots must live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fourth house.

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house. The answer is (B)."
"Let's figure this out. 

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all got different stuff: one ate spaghetti, one ate fried rice. One plays the flute, one plays the cello. One wears loafers, one wears sandals. One likes white, one likes green. And one got a sedan, one got an SUV.

Clue 1 says the person who ate fried rice don't live in the first house. That means the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

Clue 2 says the person who owns an SUV don't live in the second house. That means the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

Clue 3 says the flute player lives next to the person who likes white. That means the flute player lives in the second house.

Clue 4 says the person who wears loafers lives next to the person who likes white. That means the person who likes white lives in the first house, and the person who wears loafers lives in the first house too.

Now we got this: the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house, the person who wears loafers lives in the first house, and the person who likes white lives in the first house.

The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, and the flute player lives in the second house. That means the person who ate fried rice is the flute player.

The only person left is the person who owns a sedan and likes green. They must live in the second house, and they must be wearing sandals.

Now, let's put it all together. The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, 'cause they live to the left of the person who eats mangos. The person who eats apples lives in the second house, 'cause the person who owns a sedan lives to the left of them. The person who eats apples lives to the left of the violinist, so the violinist lives in the third house.

"So, there's two houses next to each other, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. There's a person in each house. They got different stuff: one's got a computer and the other's got a TV. And they got different flowers too: one's got lilies and the other's got a rose.

Now, I know the person with the TV lives in the first house. That's clue number 2. And clue number 1 says the person with the lilies don't live in the first house.

So, if the person with the lilies don't live in the first house, that means they live in the second house. And if the person with the TV lives in the first house, that means the person in the first house can't have lilies or a TV. They must have the computer.

So, the person with the computer lives in the first house. That's option (B)."
"So, let's figure this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all like different stuff.

One person had pizza, and the other had spaghetti. One person's got tulips, and the other's got daffodils. They like different kinds of books, too - one's into history, and the other's into science fiction. They also play different sports - one's a baseball player, and the other's a golfer. And they play different instruments - one's a guitarist, and the other's a percussionist.

Now, let's see... The science fiction book person lives to the left of the golfer. That means the golfer can't be in the left house. So, the golfer's in the right house.

The person who had pizza and the history book person live next to each other. Since the golfer's in the right house, they must be in the left house.

Now, the person with daffodils lives to the right of the guitarist. Since the person with daffodils can't be in the left house (because the person in the left house had pizza), the person with daffodils must be in the right house. This means the guitarist's in the left house.

So, we got:
- Left house: Person who had pizza, history book person, and guitarist
- Right house: Golfer, person with daffodils

The only thing left is the sport and the instrument for the person in the right house. Since the person in the right house is a golfer, they must be the percussionist.

The answer is (B) 1."

From clue"
"Let's figure this out. 

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all got different stuff: different flowers, different food, different sports, different devices, and different instruments.

From what I know, the person with lilies lives in the first house. That's clue number 3.

Now, let's think about the person with a radio. Clue number 1 says they live to the right of the person eating apples. Clue number 2 says they live to the right of the violinist. 

So, the person with a radio lives to the right of the violinist and to the right of the person eating apples. That means the person eating apples can't live in the first house, 'cause the person with a radio lives to the right of them.

Clue number 4 says the basketball player don't live in the first house. That means they live in the second house.

Now, let's put it all together. The person with lilies lives in the first house. The basketball player lives in the second house. The person eating apples can't live in the first house, so they must live in the second house. But we already said the basketball player lives in the second house, so the person eating apples must live in the first house.

Now, we got a problem. The person with a radio lives to the right of the violinist and to the right of the person eating apples. But the person eating apples lives in the first house. That means the person with a radio lives in the second house.

Now, let's think about the violinist. If the violinist lives in the first house, then the person with a radio lives in the second house, which is correct. But if the violinist lives in the second house, then the person with a radio would have to live in the third house, but there ain't no third house.

So, the violinist must live in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 5 houses with different people in 'em. Each person plays a different sport and ate a different food. We gotta figure out who lives in which house.

Clue 7 says the tennis player lives to the left of the soccer player. That means the soccer player lives in the fourth or fifth house.

"Let's figure this out. 

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all like different stuff. 

One person ate stew and one person ate spaghetti. One person likes white and one person likes red. One person only drinks water and one person likes milk. One person plays baseball and one person swims. One person wears running shoes and one person wears loafers.

Now, let's think about this. The person who wears running shoes don't live in the first house. That's clue number one. 

The person who likes white lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. That's clue number two. So, the person who likes white must live in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house.

Now, the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other. That's clue number three. So, the baseball player must live in the second house too.

The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other. That's clue number four. So, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house too.

Now we got this:
- The person who likes white lives in the first house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.
- The baseball player lives in the second house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
- The person who wears running shoes lives in the second house.

The person who likes red must live in the second house, 'cause the person who likes white lives in the first house. And the person who likes red can't be the baseball player, 'cause the baseball player lives in the second house. So, the person who likes red must be the person who ate stew. And the person who ate stew must live in the first house.

Now we got this:
- The person who likes white lives in the first house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.
- The baseball player lives in the second house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
- The person who wears running shoes lives in the second house.
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- The person who ate stew lives in the first house.

The person who wears loafers must live in the first house, 'cause the person who wears running shoes lives in the second house.

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people. Each person is eatin' different fruits: grapes, oranges, and mangos. And they all drink different stuff: coffee, root beer, and water.

From what I know, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eatin' mangos. That means the order for those two could be coffee, mangos or mangos, coffee.

Now, the root beer lover don't live in the second house. That means they gotta live in either the first or the third house.

The person eatin' oranges don't live in the second house. That means they gotta live in either the first or the third house.

Now, the person drinkin' water lives to the right of the root beer lover. If the root beer lover lives in the first house, the person drinkin' water must live in the third house. But if the root beer lover lives in the third house, the person drinkin' water would have to live in the third house too, which don't make sense. So, the root beer lover must live in the first house.

So, the order is: 
- House 1: root beer lover
- House 2: 
- House 3: 

Now, we gotta figure out who's eatin' mangos and who's drinkin' water and eatin' oranges. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eatin' mangos, so the person eatin' mangos must live in the third house. The person drinkin' water and eatin' oranges must live in the second house.

The final order is: 
- House 1: root beer lover
- House 2: person drinkin' water and eatin' oranges
- House 3: coffee drinker and eatin' mangos

So, the root beer lover lives in the first house. The answer is (B)."
"Let's figure this out. 

We got three houses, and three people. Each person ate somethin' different: spaghetti, pizza, and fried rice. And each person is wearin' different shoes: loafers, runnin' shoes, and boots.

Now, let's look at the clues:

1. The person who ate fried rice ain't in the second house.
2. The person wearin' boots lives next to the person who ate fried rice, but to the left.
3. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
4. The person wearin' loafers ain't in the first house.

So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. That's clue 3. Now, we gotta figure out the rest.

From clue 2, we know the person wearin' boots lives next to the person who ate fried rice, but to the left. That means the person who ate fried rice can't be in the second house, so the person who's wearin' boots must be in the second house. And the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house.

Now we got this:
- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Fried Rice

Clue 4 says the person wearin' loafers ain't in the first house. And we already know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. So, the person wearin' loafers must be in either the second or the third house.

But clue 2 says the person wearin' boots lives next to the person who ate fried rice, to the left. That means the person wearin' boots is in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice is in the third house. So, the person wearin' loafers must be in the third house.

So, the person who's wearin' loafers lives in the third house. That's option (C)."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 5 houses with different people in 'em. Each person's got a different car, ate different food, eats different fruit, likes different books, and has different stuff like a TV or a gameboy.

From what I know, the person who drives a convertible don't live in the second house. That's clue number one.

Now, the history book person lives to the left of the gameboy person. That's clue number two.

The romance book person don't live in the fifth house. That's clue number three.

The person who ate fried rice don't live in the first house. That's clue number four.

The person who ate grilled cheese don't live in the fifth house. That's clue number five.

The person who eats oranges lives to the left of the person who owns a sedan. That's clue number six.

"Let's figure dis out. We got 4 houses, and each house got a person in it. Each person got a different car, ate different food, got different flowers, eats different fruit, and likes different color.

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.

From clue 4, the person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person who drives a truck don't live in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

From clue 8, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.

Now, let's think about it. If the person who likes green lives in the first house, and the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue, then the person who had pizza must live in the second house. 

The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house. The person who drives a truck don't live in the third house, so the person who drives a truck must live in the first house. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies, so the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other. Since the person who had pizza lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the third house. The person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza, so the person who is eating mangos must live in the first house. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos, so the person who likes red must live in the second house.

The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person who drives a truck lives in the first house, the person who drives a minivan must live in the third house. The person who ate spaghetti must live in the fourth house.

The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. The person who had pizza lives in the second house, so the person who is eating apples must live in the second house.

The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. The person who had pizza lives in the second house, so the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the second house.

The person who is eating grapes must live in the fourth house, since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the third house, since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.

The person who likes red lives in the second house, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house, the person who had pizza lives in the second house, the person who is eating apples lives in the second house, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating grapes lives in the fourth house, the person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house, the person who likes blue lives in the third house, the person who drives a truck lives in the first house, and the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.

The person who had pizza lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"So, let's figure this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all got different stuff: one's eatin' grapes, one's eatin' mangos; one's got a convertible, one's got a minivan; and one's a cricketer, one's a baseball player.

We know the person eatin' grapes ain't in the first house. We also know the baseball player's in the second house. And the person with the convertible's in the second house too.

So, the second house is where the baseball player and the person with the convertible live. That means the first house can't be the one with the grapes, 'cause we already know that ain't in the first house. And it can't be the second house neither, 'cause that's where the baseball player and the convertible person live.

So, the person eatin' grapes must be in the first house. Now, we got the first house with grapes and the second house with the baseball player and the convertible. That means the person in the second house can't be eatin' grapes, so they must be eatin' mangos.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure this out. 

We got three houses, and three people. Each person likes a different color and eats a different fruit. The colors are blue, white, and green. The fruits are apples, kiwis, and oranges.

We know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. That's clue number 2.

Now, let's think about clue number 3. It says the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who eats kiwis. That means the person who eats kiwis can't live in the second house, 'cause that's where the person who likes blue lives. So, the person who eats kiwis must live in the third house.

Clue number 4 says the person who eats apples lives to the left of the person who eats oranges. That means the person who eats apples must live in the first house, and the person who eats oranges must live in the second house.

Now we got this: 1 (apples), 2 (oranges), 3 (kiwis).

Clue number 1 says the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the first house. That means the person who likes white must live in the third house.

So, the person who likes white lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's figure this out. 

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all like different stuff: different books, different drinks, different sports, different devices, and different flowers.

Clue 1 says the person who likes root beer lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet. That means the person with a rose bouquet can't be in the house on the right.

Clue 2 says the soccer player lives next to the mystery book reader. That means the soccer player can't be in the house on the right, or the mystery book reader would be in the house on the left.

Clue 3 says the person with a gameboy lives to the left of the mystery book reader. That means the person with a gameboy can't be in the house on the right, or the mystery book reader would be in the house on the left.

Now, let's think about it. If the person with a rose bouquet is in the house on the left, the person with a gameboy would be in the house on the left too, because the mystery book reader would be in the house on the right. But Clue 3 says the person with a gameboy lives to the left of the mystery book reader, so that can't be right.

So, the person with a rose bouquet must be in the house on the right. The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, we know the person who drives a truck lives left of the person who owns a sedan. That means they gotta be in the first house, and the sedan person is in the second house.

Now, the fish enthusiast lives left of the dog owner. That means the fish enthusiast is in the second house, and the dog owner is in the third house. But wait, we already said the sedan person is in the second house. So, the fish enthusiast must be in the second house, and the dog owner is in the third house.

Now, there are two houses between the truck person and the dog owner. That means the truck person is in the first house, and the dog owner is in the third house. This works out.

Lastly, the person who drives a minivan lives right of the fish enthusiast. That means the minivan person is in the fourth house.

So, the order is: 1 (truck), 2 (fish enthusiast), 3 (dog owner), 4 (minivan).

The answer is (D) 3."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got four houses with people in 'em, and each person likes a different color and drinks a different drink. We gotta figure out who likes what and where they live.

Okay, so the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. That's clue number one. And the person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk. That's clue number two.

Now, the root beer lover lives in the second house. That's clue number three. And the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. That's clue number four.

Lastly, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. That's clue number five.

So, let's start with clue number five. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house. That means the person who likes milk lives in the fourth house, 'cause the person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk.

Now, we know the root beer lover lives in the second house. That means the person who only drinks water lives in the first house, 'cause the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water.

But wait, we don't know who likes white yet. Let's go back to clue number one. The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. And we know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. That means the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

So, the order is: 
1. The person who only drinks water
2. The root beer lover
3. The person who likes yellow
4. The person who likes blue

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house, so the answer is (B) 4."
"Let's figure this out. 

From clue 6, we know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. That's a good start.

From clue 2, we know the baseball player lives to the left of the cat lover. So, the baseball player can't be in the second house, 'cause that's where the blue person lives. That means the baseball player is in the first house.

Let's try to put some of these clues together. We know the baseball player is in the first house. We also know the person who likes blue is in the second house. That means the baseball player is in the first house, and the blue person is in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who eats grapes lives to the right of the basketball player. Since the blue person is in the second house, the basketball player must be in the first house. But we already know the baseball player is in the first house. So, the basketball player must be in the third house, and the person who eats grapes is in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person who wears loafers lives to the right of the person who eats grapes. Since the person who eats grapes is in the second house, the person who wears loafers is in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person who wears sandals lives to the right of the dog owner. Since the person who wears loafers is in the third house, the dog owner must be in the first house. But we already know the baseball player is in the first house. So, the dog owner is in the first house, and the baseball player is in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the dog owner lives to the left of the person who likes green. Since the dog owner is in the first house, the person who likes green is in the second house. But we already know the person who eats grapes is in the second house. So, the person who likes green is in the first house, and the person who eats grapes is in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the cricketer lives to the right of the person who eats oranges. Since the person who eats grapes is in the second house, the person who eats oranges must be in the first house. But we already know the person who likes green is in the first house. So, the person who eats oranges is in the first house, and the person who likes green is in the second house.

From the remaining options, the person who is a basketball player is in the third house, the person who eats mangos is in the first house, and the person who is a bird keeper is in the second house.

The answer is (C)."

"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 5 houses and 5 people, each with different stuff. One's a tennis player, one's a golfer, one's a cricketer, one's a basketball player, and one's a swimmer. They all eat different fruits: grapes, kiwis, mangos, oranges, and bananas. They all like different books: mystery, fantasy, science fiction, history, and romance. And they all like different colors: green, yellow, red, white, and blue.

Clue 1: The person who eats kiwis lives left of the tennis player.

Clue 2: The mystery book reader lives right of the person who eats oranges.

Clue 3: The cricketer lives left of the person who likes yellow.

Clue 4: The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other.

Clue 5: The person who eats mangos don't live in the fourth house.

Clue 6: The swimmer lives left of the person who likes green.

Clue 7: The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.

Clue 8: The cricketer lives left of the person who likes white.

Clue 9: The cricketer lives left of the fantasy book enthusiast.

Clue 10: There's two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the tennis player lives.

Clue 11: The person who eats bananas don't live in the fifth house.

Clue 12: There's one house between where the person who eats mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives.

Clue 13: There's two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

Okay, so let's start with Clue 7. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house. That's a good start.

From Clue 11, the person who eats bananas don't live in the fifth house, so they must live in the first, second, third, or fourth house.

From Clue 8, the cricketer lives left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house, the person who likes white must live in the fourth house. This means the cricketer lives in the third house.

From Clue 9, the cricketer lives left of the fantasy book enthusiast. This means the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.

From Clue 5, the person who eats mangos don't live in the fourth house. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person who eats mangos must live in the first or second house.

From Clue 12, there's one house between where the person who eats mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the person who likes green lives in the third house. However, we already know the cricketer lives in the third house, so the person who likes green must live in the second house. This means the person who eats mangos lives in the first house.

From Clue 1, the person who eats kiwis lives left of the tennis player. Since the person who eats mangos lives in the first house, the person who eats kiwis must live in the second house. This means the tennis player lives in the third house.

From Clue 6, the swimmer lives left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the swimmer must live in the first house.

From Clue 10, there's two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the tennis player lives. Since the tennis player lives in the third house, the romance book lover must live in the first house.

From Clue 13, there's two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives. Since the romance book lover lives in the first house, the mystery book reader must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 2, the mystery book reader lives right of the person who eats oranges. Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, the person who eats oranges must live in the third house.

However, we already know the tennis player lives in the third house, so the person who eats oranges must live in the third house, which is a contradiction. This means our previous assumption that the tennis player lives in the third house is incorrect.

From Clue 4, the golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the golfer and the science fiction book fanatic must live in the second and fourth houses, or the first and third houses.

From Clue 1, the person who eats kiwis lives left of the tennis player. Since the person who eats mangos lives in the first house, the person who eats kiwis must live in the second house. This means the tennis player lives in the third house.

However, we already know the cricketer lives in the third house, so the person who eats kiwis must live in the second house, which is a contradiction. This means our previous assumption that the person who eats mangos lives in the first house is incorrect.

From Clue 5, the person who eats mangos don't live in the fourth house. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person who eats mangos must live in the first or second house.

From Clue 12, there's one house between where the person who eats mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the person who likes green lives in the third house. However, we already know the cricketer lives in the third house, so the person who likes green must live in the second house. This means the person who eats mangos lives in the first house.

From Clue 1, the person who eats kiwis lives left of the tennis player. Since the person who eats mangos lives in the first house, the person who eats kiwis must live in the second house. This means the tennis player lives in the third house.

From Clue 6, the swimmer lives left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the swimmer must live in the first house.

From Clue 10, there's two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the tennis player lives. Since the tennis player lives in the third house, the romance book lover must live in the first house.

From Clue 13, there's two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives. Since the romance book lover lives in the first house, the mystery book reader must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 2, the mystery book reader lives right of the person who eats oranges. Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, the person who eats oranges must live in the third house.

However, we already know the tennis player lives in the third house, so the person who eats oranges must live in the third house, which is a contradiction. This means our previous assumption that the tennis player lives in the third house is incorrect.

From Cl"
"So, let's figure this out. We got two houses, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. There's a cellist and a guitarist, and one of 'em lives in each house. Then there's a person with a computer and one with a gameboy, and they live in different houses too. And we got a dog owner and a fish person, and they live in different houses.

Now, let's see... the cellist lives next to the person with the gameboy. That means the cellist can't be in the second house, 'cause then the person with the gameboy would be in the first house, and they're next to each other. So the cellist must be in the first house, and the person with the gameboy is in the second house.

Now, we know the dog owner don't live in the first house. That means the dog owner must live in the second house.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure this out. We got four houses, and each one's got a different car and a different device. We gotta find out which house the person with the SUV lives in.

We know the person with the minivan lives in the first house. That's a given.

Now, the person with the gameboy lives in the third house. That's a clue.

The person with the phone lives to the left of the person with the SUV. That's another clue.

The person with the radio lives to the right of the person with the gameboy. That's a clue too.

The person with the convertible don't live in the third house. That's a clue.

And the person with the computer don't live in the first house. That's another clue.

Now, let's put it all together. The person with the minivan's in the first house. The person with the gameboy's in the third house. The person with the phone's gotta be in the second house, 'cause they live to the left of the person with the SUV.

Now, we got the person with the phone in the second house, and the person with the gameboy in the third house. That means the person with the radio's gotta be in the fourth house, 'cause they live to the right of the person with the gameboy.

So, the person with the SUV's gotta be in the fourth house. That's the only one left.

The answer is (A) 4."

Let's start with the person with a computer in the second house. Then the person with tulips in the third house. Now, the person with a rose lives to the left of the person with carnations, so the person with a rose must live in the first house, and the person with carnations must live in the fourth house.

Now, the person with a phone lives to the left of the person with a TV, so the person with a phone must live in the first house, and the person with a TV must live in the fifth house.

Now, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person with a phone, so the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in the fifth house.

Now, the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person with a radio, but not in the fourth house. The person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in the fifth house, but that's already taken by the person with lilies. So, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in the fourth house.

So, the person with carnations lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (C) 4."

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all got different stuff: one likes root beer, one likes water; one's eatin' a banana, one's eatin' grapes; one had pizza, one had stew; one drives a truck, one drives a minivan; and one's got a radio, one's got a computer.

Now, let's see what we know. The person with the radio and the person with the truck live next to each other. The person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. The person who likes root beer don't live in the first house. And the person who's eatin' grapes lives to the left of the person with the computer.

Let's think about it. If the person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza, and the person with the radio and the person with the truck live next to each other, then the person with the radio must live in the first house. And the person with the truck must live in the second house.

Now, we know the person with the radio lives in the first house, and the person who had pizza lives to the right of the person with the radio. So, the person who had pizza must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure this out. We got 4 houses, and each house got a person in it. Each person ate somethin' different for lunch: grilled cheese, spaghetti, pizza, and fried rice. Each person likes a different color: red, yellow, white, and green. And each person drinks somethin' different: coffee, tea, water, and milk.

We know the tea drinker lives in the first house. That's clue number 1.

Clue number 2 says the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. That means the person who likes milk can't live in the first house, 'cause the tea drinker lives there.

Clue number 3 says the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. That means the person who likes yellow can't live in the first house, 'cause the tea drinker lives there.

Clue number 4 says the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. That's a good clue.

Clue number 5 says the tea drinker lives to the left of the person who had pizza. That means the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

Clue number 6 says the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. That means the person who ate spaghetti can't live in the second house, 'cause the person who had pizza lives there.

Clue number 7 says the person who likes green don't live in the first house. That's a good clue.

Clue number 8 says the person who ate grilled cheese don't live in the first house. That's another good clue.

Now, let's put it all together. The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. The person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. The person who had pizza lives in the second house. The person who likes green don't live in the first house. The person who ate grilled cheese don't live in the first house.

So, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live in the third and fourth houses. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house. The person who likes milk lives in the third house. The person who had pizza lives in the second house. The person who likes green don't live in the first house, so they must live in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (D) 2 is not correct because the person who had pizza lives in the second house. The correct answer is (A) 1 is not correct because the tea drinker lives in the first house. The correct answer is (B) 3 is not correct because the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live in the third and fourth houses. The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Let's figure this out. We got four houses, and each one's got a different person in it. They all got different stuff too: pets, shoes, favorite drinks, favorite colors, and cars.

From what I know, the person who likes yellow don't live in the last house. That's clue number one. The person who owns a dog lives next to the person who only drinks water. That's clue number two. There's one house between the person who likes red and the person who owns an SUV. That's clue number three. The person who owns a dog lives in the third house. That's clue number four. There's two houses between the person who likes milk and the person who owns a sedan. That's clue number five. The person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who wears sandals. That's clue number six. The person who wears loafers don't live in the first house. That's clue number seven. The person who owns horses lives in the last house. That's clue number eight. The person who likes root beer lives to the left of the person who likes coffee. That's clue number nine. The person who wears high heels lives to the left of the person who owns a dog. That's clue number ten. The person who owns an SUV lives to the right of the person who wears loafers. That's clue number eleven. The person who likes white lives in the third house. That's clue number twelve. And the person who likes fish lives in the first house. That's clue number thirteen.

Okay, so the person who likes fish lives in the first house. The person who owns horses lives in the last house. The person who wears loafers don't live in the first house, so they must live in the second or third house. But the person who likes white lives in the third house, so the person who wears loafers must live in the second house.

The person who owns a dog lives in the third house, but the person who owns a dog lives next to the person who only drinks water. So the person who only drinks water must live in the second house.

The person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who wears sandals. Since the person who wears loafers lives in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house.

The person who likes yellow don't live in the last house, so they must live in the first, second, or third house. The person who wears high heels lives to the left of the person who owns a dog. Since the person who owns a dog lives in the third house, the person who wears high heels must live in the first or second house.

The person who likes root beer lives to the left of the person who likes coffee. Since the person who wears high heels lives in the first or second house, the person who likes root beer must live in the first house, and the person who wears high heels must live in the second house.

There's two houses between the person who likes milk and the person who owns a sedan. Since the person who owns a sedan must live in the second, third, or fourth house, the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

The person who owns an SUV lives to the right of the person who wears loafers. Since the person who wears loafers lives in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

There's one house between the person who likes red and the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house, the person who likes red must live in the third house.

So, the person who likes red lives in the third house. That's option (A)."

The person who eats grapes lives in the second house, so the person who has lilies lives in the first house."
"So, let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people. Each person is different, like, they like different sports and eat different food and got different flowers. 

Okay, so the soccer player lives in the third house. That's a fact. 

Now, the golfer lives to the left of the basketball player. That means they can't be in the third house, 'cause the soccer player is already there. So, the golfer and basketball player gotta be in the first and second houses.

Now, the person with lilies lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. That means the person with lilies is in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house.

But, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. That means the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house. And we already know the soccer player is in the third house, so that's gotta be the person who ate spaghetti.

Now, the person with tulips can't be in the third house, 'cause that's where the soccer player is. So, the person with tulips is in the first house. And we already know the person with lilies is in the first house, so that means the person with tulips is the golfer.

Now we got it all figured out:
- The person with lilies (golfer) is in the first house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese (basketball player) is in the second house.
- The person who ate spaghetti (soccer player) is in the third house.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house. That's option (B)."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, we know the pianist lives in the third house. That's from clue 3. 

Now, clue 9 says the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house."
"Let's figure dis out. We got 4 houses, and each house got a person in it. Each person is wearin' different shoes, ate different food, and drinks different stuff.

We know the tea drinker lives in the third house (clue 1).

The person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 2). That means the person who had stew can't live in the third house, 'cause the tea drinker lives there.

The person who is wearin' high heels and the person who only drinks water live next to each other (clue 6). That means they can't live in the first or fourth house, 'cause there ain't nobody else to live next to 'em.

The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (clue 4). That means the person who ate grilled cheese can't live in the fourth house.

The person who is wearin' sandals lives to the left of the person who is wearin' high heels (clue 3). That means the person who is wearin' sandals can't live in the third house.

The person who is wearin' running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew (clue 5). That means the person who is wearin' running shoes can't live in the third or fourth house.

Now, let's put it all together. The person who is wearin' high heels and the person who only drinks water live next to each other, and they can't live in the first or fourth house. That means they live in the second and third house. But the person who is wearin' high heels can't live in the third house, 'cause the tea drinker lives there. So, the person who is wearin' high heels lives in the second house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the third house.

The person who ate grilled cheese can't live in the fourth house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the third house. That means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.

"Let's figure dis out. We got 4 houses, and each house got a person in it. Each person is different, ya know? They all got different shoes, drinks, devices, sports, and lunch.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk lives to the right of the tea drinker. That's a good start.

Now, let's put it all together. We know the basketball player lives in the fourth house. We also know the person with a radio lives in the third house. And we know the cricketer and the person with loafers live in the third house. That means the cricketer and the person with loafers must be the same person, and they live in the third house.

From clue 8, the soccer player and the person with a computer live next to each other. Since the cricketer and the person with loafers live in the third house, the soccer player and the person with a computer must live in the second and first houses.

From clue 4, the person with boots lives left of the person with a computer. That means the person with boots lives in the first house, and the person with a computer lives in the second house.

So, the order of the houses is:

1. Person who likes milk
2. Tea drinker
3. Cricketer (or person with loafers)
4. Basketball player

The person with a computer lives in the first house.

The answer is (D)."
"So, there's two houses next to each other, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. They got different food for lunch, one had pizza and the other had fried rice. And they like different kinds of books, one likes science fiction and the other likes history.

Now, I know the person who had fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fan. That means the science fiction book fan lives in the left house, which is number 1."
"So, let's figure this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all got different stuff: one's got a dog, one's got horses. One likes blue, one likes white. One drinks root beer, one drinks water. And one plays the violin, one plays the piano.

Okay, so the person who plays the piano lives in the first house. That's a start.

Now, the person who likes white don't live in the second house. That means the person who likes white lives in the first house. But wait, the person who plays the piano lives in the first house, so the person who likes white can't live there. That means the person who likes white lives in the second house.

Now, the person who drinks root beer lives to the right of the person who owns horses. And the person who plays the piano lives in the first house, so the person who owns horses lives in the first house too. That means the person who drinks root beer lives in the second house.

So, we got this: the person in the first house plays the piano and owns horses. The person in the second house likes white and drinks root beer.

Now, we're left with the dog owner and the person who likes blue. The person who likes blue can't live in the second house 'cause the person in the second house likes white. So, the person who likes blue lives in the first house. And that means the person in the first house is the dog owner.

So, the dog owner lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"So, let's figure this out. We got four houses, and each person's got their own thing goin' on. There's a history book buff, a romance book lover, a science fiction book fanatic, and a fantasy book enthusiast. Each person ate somethin' different: fried rice, spaghetti, pizza, and stew. And they all play different instruments: violin, percussion, saxophone, and guitar.

Clue 6: The history book buff lives to the right of the percussionist. That's another clue.

Clue 7: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. That's the last clue.

Now, let's put it all together. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. That means the person who had stew can't be in the fourth house, so they must be in the second house. The person who ate fried rice must be in the first house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the third house.

The guitarist lives to the left of the violinist, and the violinist can't be in the fourth house, so they must be in the first or second house. But the guitarist can't be in the first house, so the guitarist must be in the first house, and the violinist must be in the second house.

The percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, and the person who had stew lives in the second house, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house. That means the percussionist must be in the third house.

The history book buff lives to the right of the percussionist, so the history book buff must be in the fourth house. But wait, the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, so the history book buff can't be in the fourth house. That means the history book buff must be in the third house, and the percussionist must be in the second house.

So, the percussionist lives in the second house. The answer is (A)."
"Let's figure this out. 

We know the person who likes white lives in the first house. That's from Clue 1.

Now, Clue 4 says the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other. So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the second house.

Clue 2 says the person who wears boots doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who wears boots must live in the first house.

Clue 5 says the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who wears running shoes. Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the first house. But we already know the person who wears boots lives in the first house. So, the person who likes green must be the one wearing boots.

Clue 3 says the bird keeper doesn't live in the third house. Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the bird keeper must live in the first house. But we already know the person who wears boots lives in the first house, and the person who likes green must be the one wearing boots. So, the bird keeper must live in the first house.

So, the person who owns horses lives in the second house.

The answer is (B)."
"Let's figure this out. 

We got three houses, and three people. Each person is eatin' different fruits: apples, oranges, and mangos. And they all like different drinks: coffee, root beer, and milk.

From what I know, the person who likes coffee lives next to the person who likes milk. That's clue number one.

Now, the person who eats mangos lives next to the person who eats apples. That's clue number two.

The person who likes coffee can't live in the middle house. That's clue number three.

And the person who eats apples lives in the last house. That's clue number four.

So, if the person who eats apples lives in the last house, and the person who eats mangos lives next to them, that means the person who eats mangos lives in the second house.

Now, the person who likes coffee can't live in the middle house, so they must live in the first house. And since the person who likes coffee lives next to the person who likes milk, that means the person who likes milk lives in the second house.

So, the answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people. Each person is wearin' different shoes, and they all like different things. One likes red, one likes green, and one likes white.

Clue 1 says the science fiction book person lives in the second house, so that's gotta be the person with tulips. 

Now, Clue 7 says the person with tulips lives to the left of the person who likes red. So the person who likes red lives in the third house. Clue 2 says the person wearin' loafers and the person who likes red live next to each other. So the person wearin' loafers lives in the third house too.

Clue 5 says the person wearin' boots don't live in the third house. So the person wearin' boots lives in either the first or second house. But Clue 4 says the person with carnations lives in the first house. So the person wearin' boots lives in the second house.

Now, Clue 6 says the history book person lives to the right of the person with tulips. But we already know the person with tulips lives in the second house, and the person wearin' boots lives in the second house too. So the history book person can't live in the second house. That means the history book person lives in the first house.

But wait, Clue 4 says the person with carnations lives in the first house. So the history book person can't live in the first house. This is a problem.

Let's try again. Clue 3 says the person who likes white lives next to the person with tulips. So the person who likes white lives in the first house. Clue 4 says the person with carnations lives in the first house. So the person who likes white lives in the first house, and the person with carnations lives in the first house. That means the person with tulips lives in the second house.

Clue 7 says the person with tulips lives to the left of the person who likes red. So the person who likes red lives in the third house. Clue 2 says the person wearin' loafers and the person who likes red live next to each other. So the person wearin' loafers lives in the third house too.

Clue 5 says the person wearin' boots don't live in the third house. So the person wearin' boots lives in either the first or second house. But we already know the person with tulips lives in the second house. So the person wearin' boots lives in the first house.

Clue 6 says the history book person lives to the right of the person with tulips. So the history book person lives in the third house.

Now, let's put it all together.

"So, let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people. Each person's got different flowers and drinks. 

One person's got water, one's got milk, and one's got root beer. And they all got different flowers: lilies, tulips, and a rose.

Now, the person who only drinks water lives in the first house. That's clue number one.

Clue number two says there's one house between the person who only drinks water and the person who likes milk. That means the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Clue number three says the person with lilies lives to the right of the person with tulips. And clue number four says the person with lilies lives in the second house.

So, if the person with lilies lives in the second house, and they live to the right of the person with tulips, that means the person with tulips must live in the first house.

Now we got the order: 
- House 1: person with tulips
- House 2: person with lilies
- House 3: person with milk

The only one left is the person with the rose bouquet. They must live in the third house.

So, the answer is (B) 3."

From clue 9, we know the person wearin' loafers lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 8, we know the tennis player lives in the third house. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, the tennis player is the person who likes yellow.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. Since the tennis player is the person who likes yellow, the person who has a gameboy must live in the third house as well.

Now, the romance book lover lives to the left of the history book buff. That's clue number 2. And the person who likes green lives to the left of the history book buff. That's clue number 1.

The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, so that's clue number 4. The romance book lover lives in the second house, and the history book buff lives in the third house. 

Now, the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the romance book lover. That's clue number 5. So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. 

The person who had pizza can't live in the first house, 'cause that's clue number 3. And the person who ate fried rice already lives in the third house, so the person who had pizza must live in the second house.

Now, we got the person who likes green left. They can't live in the first house, and they can't live in the third house. So, they must live in the second house. But wait, the romance book lover lives in the second house. So, the person who likes green must be the romance book lover. But that's not possible, 'cause the romance book lover likes a romance book, not a history book. 

So, the person who likes green must be the person who had pizza. But that's not possible neither, 'cause the person who had pizza lives in the second house, and the romance book lover lives in the second house. 

Wait a minute... I got it! The person who likes green must be the person who ate fried rice. But that's not possible, 'cause the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. 

Let me think... The person who likes green must be the person who had pizza. But that's not possible, 'cause the person who had pizza lives in the second house. 

I got it! The person who likes green must be the person who ate grilled cheese. And the person who had pizza must be the romance book lover. And the person who ate fried rice must be the history book buff.

So, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. The correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"Let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people, and they all got different stuff. One got a computer, one got a radio, and one got a TV. One got carnations, one got roses, and one got tulips. And they all play different sports: golf, soccer, and tennis.

Clue 1 says the tennis player lives to the left of the person with a TV. That's a good start.

Clue 2 says the golfer don't live in the second house. That helps narrow it down a bit.

Clue 3 says the person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other. That's a good clue.

Clue 4 says the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with roses. That's a good clue too.

Clue 5 says the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a TV. That's another good clue.

Let's try to put it all together. If the tennis player lives to the left of the person with a TV, and the person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other, that means the person with a computer can't be in the second house, 'cause then the person with tulips would be in the third house, and the person with a TV would be in the first house, but the tennis player lives to the left of the person with a TV, so that don't work.

So, the person with a computer and the person with tulips must be in the first and second houses. That means the person with a TV is in the third house.

Now, let's look at the clues again. Clue 4 says the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with roses. Clue 5 says the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a TV. That means the person with a radio lives in the third house, and the person with roses lives in the second house.

Now we got it all figured out. The person with a computer lives in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 5 houses, and each one's got a different person in it. They all play different instruments, got different flowers, and wear different shoes. And we got clues to help us figure it out.

Okay, so the swimmer lives in the third house. That's clue number one. 

Now, the person with carnations lives to the right of the guitarist. That's clue number two. 

The person with sandals lives to the left of the person with tulips. That's clue number three. 

The person with running shoes lives to the left of the person with daffodils. That's clue number four.

The person with daffodils lives in the fifth house. That's clue number eleven. 

There are two houses between the person with sandals and the cellist. That's clue number twelve.

Okay, so the person with daffodils lives in the fifth house. That means the person with running shoes lives in the fourth house. But wait, the cricketer lives in the fourth house. That can't be right. 

Let me think about this some more. 

The basketball player lives in the third house. That means the guitarist lives in the fourth house. But the person with running shoes lives in the fourth house. That's a problem.

"
"So, let's figure this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all got different stuff:

- One person got a dog, and the other got a fish.
- One person had stew, and the other had grilled cheese.
- One person is wearin' high heels, and the other is wearin' sandals.

Now, let's see what we know:

1. The person in high heels lives next to the fish person.
2. The person who had grilled cheese lives in the second house.

So, the person who had grilled cheese lives in the second house. That means the person in the first house had stew. And since the person in high heels lives next to the fish person, the person in high heels must live in the first house. That means the person in the second house is the fish person.

So, the person who had stew lives in the first house. That's option (A)."
"Let's figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They like different kinds of books, got different pets, like different colors, and got different flowers in their foyer.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes blue and the history book buff live next to each other. That's a good start.

From clue 13, we know the person who owns horses lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes white lives next to the person who owns horses. Since the person who owns horses is in the second house, the person who likes white must be in the first or third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who likes white can't be in the first house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first house.

From clue 13, we know the person who owns horses lives in the second house. However, we already know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, so this is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption that the person who likes yellow is in the first house must be incorrect. Therefore, the person who likes yellow must be in the second house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 4 houses, and each person in 'em is different. They like different colors, ate different food, eat different fruits, and drink different stuff.

Okay, so the person who likes root beer and the person who likes milk live next to each other. That's clue 1.

Now, the person who had pizza lives next to the person who likes tea. That's clue 2.

There's two houses between the person who likes root beer and the person who had grilled cheese. That's clue 3.

There's one house between the person who likes red and the person who likes yellow. That's clue 4.

There's one house between the person who eats mangos and the person who eats oranges. That's clue 5.

The person who had pizza lives next to the person who likes yellow. That's clue 6.

The person who eats oranges lives next to the person who eats apples. That's clue 7.

The person who had stew don't live in the third house. That's clue 8.

The person who had stew lives next to the person who only drinks water. That's clue 9.

The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who had stew. That's clue 10.

The person who eats apples lives to the right of the person who had pizza. That's clue 11.

Okay, so let's start with the person who had stew. They can't live in the third house, so they must live in the first or the fourth house.

If they live in the first house, then the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. The person who likes white lives in the third house. But then the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, and that's not right because the person who had pizza lives next to the person who likes yellow.

So, the person who had stew lives in the fourth house. The person who only drinks water lives in the third house. The person who likes white lives in the second house.

Now, the person who had pizza lives next to the person who likes tea, and they live next to the person who likes yellow. So, the person who had pizza lives in the first house. The person who likes yellow lives in the second house.

The person who eats oranges lives next to the person who eats apples, and the person who eats oranges lives next to the person who had stew. So, the person who eats oranges lives in the third house. The person who eats apples lives in the fourth house.

Now, the person who likes red lives one house away from the person who likes yellow. But the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, so the person who likes red lives in the first house. No, wait, that's not right. The person who had stew lives in the fourth house, so the person who likes red lives in the third house. The person who eats oranges lives in the second house. The person who eats apples lives in the fourth house.

Now, the person who had grilled cheese lives two houses away from the person who likes root beer. The person who likes root beer lives next to the person who likes milk. The person who likes milk lives in the second house. The person who had grilled cheese lives in the second house. No, wait, that's not right. The person who eats oranges lives in the second house. The person who had grilled cheese lives in the first house. No, that's not right either. The person who eats apples lives in the first house. The person who had grilled cheese lives in the second house.

The person who likes blue must live in the first house. The person who had pizza lives in the first house. The person who eats apples lives in the fourth house.

So, the person who eats apples lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (C)."
"Let's figure this out. 

From clue 7, the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house. That's a good start.

From clue 9, the person who drives a convertible lives to the left of the person who wears boots. So, the person who wears boots can't be in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who owns an SUV lives to the left of the history book buff. Since the person who drives a convertible is in the first house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the second house.

From clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the history book buff. This means the history book buff can't be in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who owns an SUV is in the second house, and the history book buff is to the right of the person who owns an SUV. So, the history book buff must be in the third house.

From clue 8, the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, but that's not possible because the person who drives a convertible is in the first house. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the third house, but that's not possible because the history book buff is in the third house. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice is in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who had stew lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the first house, the person who had stew must be in the second house, but that's not possible because the fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house. Therefore, the person who had stew must be in the first house, and the fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house.

From clue 3, the person who wears running shoes lives to the left of the person who wears high heels. Since the person who had stew is in the first house, the person who wears running shoes must be in the first house, and the person who wears high heels is in the second house.

From clue 4, the person who wears sandals lives to the right of the person who wears boots. Since the person who wears high heels is in the second house, the person who wears boots must be in the third house, and the person who wears sandals is in the fourth house.

From clue 2, the person who drives a truck lives to the left of the mystery book reader. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the second house, the person who drives a truck must be in the third house, and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house.

Now we have the order of the houses:
1. The person who had stew (wearing running shoes)
2. The fantasy book enthusiast (wearing high heels)
3. The history book buff (driving a truck)
4. The mystery book reader (wearing sandals)

The person who had pizza is not mentioned in any of the clues, but since the person who had stew is in the first house, the person who had pizza must be in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"So, let's figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each person likes a different kind of book and plays a different instrument. 

From clue 7, the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. Clue 6 says the saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other. That means the violinist must live in either the third or the fifth house.

Now, clue 5 says the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. But wait, clue 7 already says the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. That means the saxophonist can't be the mystery book reader. So, the violinist must live in the fifth house.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got four houses, and each house got a different person in it. Each person got a different thing: a radio, a phone, a television, and a gameboy. And each person is wearin' different shoes: boots, sandals, loafers, and runnin' shoes.

We know the person with the television lives in the fourth house. That's clue number one.

Clue number two says the person with the loafers lives in the second house.

Clue number three says the person with the phone don't live in the second house.

Clue number four says the person with the boots lives to the left of the person with the loafers. That means the person with the boots lives in the first house.

Clue number five says there's two houses between the person with the radio and the person with the sandals. That means the person with the radio can't be in the first or fourth house, 'cause then there wouldn't be two houses between 'em.

So, if the person with the radio ain't in the first or fourth house, and the person with the boots is in the first house, that means the person with the radio must be in the third house.

Now we got this:

- House 1: Person with boots
- House 2: Person with loafers
- House 3: Person with radio
- House 4: Person with television

The only thing left is the gameboy. And the person with the gameboy must be in the second house, 'cause that's the only one left.

So, the answer is (A) 2."
"So, there's three houses, right? And each one's got a person in it. They all like different drinks: one likes milk, one only drinks water, and one likes coffee. And they all wear different shoes: loafers, running shoes, and high heels.

Now, let's figure this out. The person in the second house wears high heels. That's clue number one.

The person who likes coffee don't live in the second house. That's clue number two.

The person who likes milk don't live in the first house. That's clue number three.

The person who likes coffee don't live in the first house. That's clue number four.

And the person who wears running shoes lives in the third house. That's clue number five.

So, if the person in the third house wears running shoes, and the person in the second house wears high heels, that means the person in the first house must like milk. And the person in the third house must like coffee.

So, the person in the second house wears high heels. That's the answer. 

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"So, there's two houses next to each other, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. There's a person in each house, and they like different kinds of books. One likes history books and the other likes mystery books. They also wear different kinds of shoes, one's wearing loafers and the other's wearing high heels.

Now, I know the person in the house with the number 1 isn't wearin' loafers. That's all I know from the first clue. The second clue says the person who likes mystery books don't live in the house with the number 2.

So, if the person in house 1 isn't wearin' loafers, that means the person in house 2 must be wearin' loafers. And since the person who likes mystery books can't live in house 2, they must live in house 1.

So, the person who's wearin' loafers lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure this out. 

From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearin' sandals. 

From clue 9, the person who is wearin' boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. 

From clue 1, the person who is wearin' runnin' shoes and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. 

From clue 6, the person who is wearin' runnin' shoes lives directly left of the person who had stew.

From clue 8, the person who is wearin' runnin' shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.

From clue 3, the person who is wearin' runnin' shoes don't live in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza.

From clue 5, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearin' sandals.

From clue 7, the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From clue 10, the person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

Now, let's think about it. The person who is wearin' runnin' shoes lives in either the first or the second house. If they live in the first house, then the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house, and the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house. But that can't be right, 'cause the person who is wearin' runnin' shoes don't live in the third house.

So, the person who is wearin' runnin' shoes must live in the second house. That means the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house, and the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

Now, let's think about the person who had pizza. From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearin' sandals. From clue 9, the person who is wearin' boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. From clue 4, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza. From clue 5, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearin' sandals.

The person who had pizza must live in the fourth house, 'cause the person who is wearin' sandals can't live in the first house, and they can't live in the second house 'cause the person who is wearin' runnin' shoes lives there.

The answer is (A)."
"So, let's figure this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all got different stuff: one's eatin' mangos, one's eatin' apples. One's got a rose bouquet, one's got lilies. And one's a pianist, one's a saxophonist.

Now, we got some clues. First, the person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the lilies. That's like, basic. Second, the saxophonist don't live in the first house. And third, the person eatin' mangos lives in the first house.

So, if the person eatin' mangos lives in the first house, that means the person eatin' apples lives in the second house. Now, we gotta figure out who's got the rose bouquet and who's got the lilies. The person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the lilies, so they must live in the first house. And since the person eatin' mangos lives in the first house, the person with the rose bouquet must be the one eatin' mangos.

But wait, we know the saxophonist don't live in the first house. And we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house. So, the saxophonist must live in the second house. And since the person eatin' apples lives in the second house, that means the person with the lilies must be the one eatin' apples.

So, the person eatin' apples lives in the second house. That's the answer.

**The correct answer is:**
(B) 2"
"Let's figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. We gotta find out where the coffee drinker lives.

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives left of the person with a phone. That means the person with a phone can't be in the first house.

From clue 2, the person who likes green lives right of the person with a convertible. That means the person with a convertible can't be in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who only drinks water don't live in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live next to each other.

From clue 5, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

From clue 15, the person who has a radio lives in the first house.

From clue 14, the basketball player lives left of the person who likes red.

From clue 12, the person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live next to each other.

So, the order of the first three houses is: 1 (radio) - 2 (basketball player) - 3 (minivan).

From clue 10, the person who likes red lives left of the golfer.

From clue 14, the basketball player lives left of the person who likes red.

So, the order of the first three houses is: 1 (radio) - 2 (basketball player) - 3 (person who likes red).

From clue 10, the person who likes red lives left of the golfer.

So, the order of the first four houses is: 1 (radio) - 2 (basketball player) - 3 (person who likes red) - 4 (golfer).

From clue 5, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

From clue 16, the coffee drinker lives left of the person who has a television.

So, the order of the first four houses is: 1 (radio) - 2 (basketball player) - 3 (person who likes red) - 4 (coffee drinker).

From clue 11, the person who owns an SUV don't live in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the person who owns a sedan lives left of the swimmer.

From clue 8, the person who likes milk lives right of the person who likes yellow.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live next to each other.

From clue 6, the person who likes yellow lives left of the cricketer.

So, the order of the last three houses is: 5 (swimmer) - 4 (person who only drinks water) - 3 (person who owns a sedan).

Now, we got the order of the houses: 1 (radio) - 2 (basketball player) - 3 (person who likes red) - 4 (coffee drinker) - 5 (swimmer).

The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is: (E) 4"
"Let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people. Each person got different flowers and cars. 

First, we know the person with tulips ain't in the third house. That's clue number one. 

Now, clue number two says the person with an SUV lives next to the person with lilies. That means the person with lilies can't be in the first house, 'cause then the SUV person would be in the second house, and that's not next to the third house. So, the person with lilies is in the third house.

Clue number three says the person with a sedan and the person with a rose live next to each other. Clue number four says the person with a rose ain't in the second house. That means the person with a rose is in the first or third house. But we already said the person with lilies is in the third house, so the person with a rose is in the first house.

Now we got the first house with a rose, the second house with... we don't know yet, and the third house with lilies. Clue number three also says the person with a sedan and the person with a rose live next to each other. That means the person with a sedan is in the second house.

Now we got the first house with a rose, the second house with a sedan, and the third house with lilies. Clue number two says the person with an SUV lives next to the person with lilies. That means the person with an SUV is in the first house.

Now we got the first house with an SUV, the second house with a sedan, and the third house with lilies. We still don't know what's in the second house. Clue number one says the person with tulips ain't in the third house, which we already knew. Clue number two says the person with an SUV lives next to the person with lilies, which we already knew. Clue number three says the person with a sedan and the person with a rose live next to each other, which we already knew.

We still don't know what's in the second house. We know the person with a sedan is in the second house, but we don't know what the other person is. We know the person with a rose is in the first house, and the person with lilies is in the third house. We also know the person with an SUV is in the first house. 

The only one left is the person with tulips. They can't be in the third house, so they must be in the second house.

"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got three houses, and three people, and they all like different kinds of books and ate different foods and like different colors. 

From what I understand, the person who likes green lives in the third house. That's clue 1.

Clue 2 says the person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live next to each other. Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

Now, clue 3 says the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the right of the person who had stew. But we don't know who had stew yet, so we can't figure that out yet.

Clue 4 says the person who ate grilled cheese doesn't live in the second house. That means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in either the first or the third house.

Clue 5 says the person who had stew lives to the left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house, and the romance book lover must live in the third house.

Now, let's think about the books. We know the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the second house. That means the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

So, the person who likes blue lives in the first house. That's option (C)."
"Let's figure this out. 

We know the person with carnations lives in the first house. That's clue 7. 

Now, clue 1 says the person with tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. So, they gotta be in the second and third houses. 

Clue 6 says the person with horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. That means they gotta be in the first and second houses. But wait, that means the person with carnations can't be in the first house 'cause the person with horses is. So, the person with horses is in the second house, and the person who likes blue is in the first house.

Now, clue 4 says the person who likes yellow is in the third house. That means the person with tulips is in the second house, and the bird keeper is in the third house.

So, the bird keeper lives in the third house. 

The answer is (C)."
"So, let's figure this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all like different stuff. One plays the piano, one plays the cello, one likes red, one likes green, and one likes mystery books and one likes fantasy books.

We know the person who likes fantasy books lives in the first house. We also know the person who plays the cello lives in the first house. And we know the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red.

So, the person in the first house is a cello player and a fantasy book reader, and they like green. That's the only way it makes sense. The person in the second house has to be the one who likes red, and they must be the piano player. And that leaves the person in the second house as the mystery book reader.

So, the mystery book reader lives in the second house. That's house number 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

"Let's figure this out. 

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all like different stuff. 

One person ate fried rice, one person ate spaghetti. One person likes cats, one person likes horses. One person likes history books, one person likes romance books. And one person wears sandals, one person wears running shoes.

Clue 1: The person who wears sandals lives next to the person who likes horses.

Clue 2: The person who likes history books lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.

Now, let's think about it. If the person who likes horses lives in the right house, then the person who wears sandals must live in the left house. 

But then, the person who likes history books has to live next to the person who ate spaghetti. If the person who ate spaghetti lives in the right house, then the person who likes history books has to live in the left house. But we already said the person who wears sandals lives in the left house. So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the left house.

Now, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the left house. But we also know the person who ate fried rice didn't eat spaghetti. So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the right house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"I don't know much about this stuff, but I'll try my best to figure it out.

Okay, so there's two houses, one on the left and one on the right. And there's a person in each house. They all got different stuff, like flowers and instruments and cars.

The person with the sedan lives to the left of the person with the lilies. That's what it says. And the flutist don't live in the first house.

So, if the flutist don't live in the first house, that means they live in the second house. And the person with the sedan lives in the first house. That's what it says.

Now, if the person with the sedan lives in the first house, and the person with the lilies lives to the right of the person with the sedan, that means the person with the lilies lives in the second house.

So, the answer is... (B) 2."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, we know there's a person in each house, and they all like different things. There's a cricketer, a swimmer, a golfer, and a tennis player. Then there's different flowers: rose, carnations, lilies, and daffodils. And they all like different kinds of books: history, romance, mystery, and fantasy.

From what I know, the person with carnations lives in the fourth house. That's a fact.

Now, the tennis player can't live in the fourth house, so they must live in the first, second, or third house.

The person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house. That's another fact.

There's one house between the person with daffodils and the person with a rose bouquet. That means the person with daffodils lives in the second house.

The golfer lives to the right of the person with daffodils. Since the person with daffodils lives in the second house, the golfer must live in the third or fourth house. But the person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house, so the golfer must live in the fourth house. That means the person with daffodils lives in the second house.

The fantasy book person lives to the left of the swimmer. Since the person with daffodils lives in the second house, the swimmer must live in the third house. That means the fantasy book person lives in the second house.

The mystery book person lives to the left of the swimmer. Since the mystery book person lives in the first house, the swimmer must live in the third house. That means the tennis player lives in the fourth house.

There are two houses between the mystery book person and the romance book person. Since the mystery book person lives in the first house, the romance book person must live in the fourth house. But wait, the tennis player lives in the fourth house. That can't be right.

Let's try again. The mystery book person lives in the first house. The tennis player lives to the right of the mystery book person. That means the tennis player lives in the second house. The person with daffodils lives in the second house, so the tennis player must live in the second house. But we already said that. Let's try again.

The mystery book person lives in the first house. The person with daffodils lives to the left of the swimmer. That means the person with daffodils lives in the second house.

"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 5 houses with different people in 'em. Each person's got a drink, a device, some flowers, and they play a musical instrument. We gotta figure out who lives in which house.

Okay, so the person who likes coffee lives in the third house. That's clue number 3.

Now, the person who likes milk lives in the fifth house. That's clue number 14.

The person who has a TV don't live in the fifth house, so they must live in one of the other four houses. That's clue number 15.

The person who only drinks water and the person who plays the saxophone live next to each other. That's clue number 16. And the person who likes milk lives in the fifth house, so the person who only drinks water and the saxophonist must live in the first or second house.

The person who has a phone lives to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. That's clue number 17. And the person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live next to each other. That's clue number 10. So, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the second house.

The person who has a bouquet of daffodils don't live in the second house, so they must live in the first house. That's clue number 7.

The person who has a radio lives to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. That's clue number 4. So, the person who has a radio must live in the second or third house.

The person who has a gameboy lives to the left of the person who has a computer. That's clue number 5. And the person who has a computer lives to the right of the cellist. That's clue number 11. So, the person who has a computer must live in the fourth or fifth house.

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the left of the percussionist. That's clue number 12. And the percussionist lives in the third house. So, the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the second house.

The person who only drinks water don't live in the fourth house. That's clue number 13. So, the person who only drinks water must live in the first house.

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house. That's what I figured out.

So, the answer is (E)."
"Let's figure this out. 

We got three houses, and three people. Each person is different. They all got different shoes, food, cars, sports, and flowers. 

One person wears boots, one wears high heels, and one wears running shoes. One person ate grilled cheese, one ate fried rice, and one had pizza. One person drives a minivan, one drives a convertible, and one owns a sedan. One person is a cricketer, one is a tennis player, and one is a golfer. One person got a rose bouquet, one got tulips, and one got carnations.

Now, let's look at the clues:

1. The person who wears boots lives next to the person who drives a minivan. The minivan person lives in the third house, so the boots person lives in the second house.

2. The person who had pizza lives to the right of the person who got a rose bouquet. This means the person who had pizza can't live in the second house, 'cause the rose person can't live there neither.

3. The person who wears running shoes don't live in the first house.

4. The cricketer lives next to the person who got tulips. The cricketer lives in the first house, so the tulips person lives in the second house.

5. The person who had pizza don't live in the second house. This means the person who had pizza lives in the third house.

6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who owns a sedan. The sedan person lives in the first house, so the grilled cheese person lives in the second house.

7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the third house. This is already known.

8. The golfer lives in the first house.

9. The person who got a rose bouquet don't live in the second house. This means the person who got a rose bouquet lives in the first or the third house.

Now, let's put it all together. The person who wears boots lives in the second house. The person who got tulips lives in the second house too. This means the person who wears boots and the person who got tulips can't live in the same house. So, the person who wears boots lives in the second house, and the person who got tulips lives in the first house.

The person who got a rose bouquet can't live in the second house, so they must live in the third house. The person who had pizza lives in the third house too. This means the person who got a rose bouquet and the person who had pizza can't live in the same house. But we already know the person who had pizza lives in the third house, so the person who got a rose bouquet must live in the third house.

The final answer is (B) 3."

From clue 4, the saxophonist lives in the third house. 

From clue 7, the person who likes yellow lives to the left of the saxophonist. So, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From clue 8, the flutist lives in the second house.

From clue 12, there is one house between the person who likes yellow and the root beer lover. Since the flutist lives in the second house, the root beer lover must live in the fourth house.

"Let's figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each house got a person in it. Each person ate somethin' different: pizza, stew, grilled cheese, fried rice, and spaghetti. And each person likes a different color: blue, yellow, white, green, and red.

Clue 1 says the person who likes green don't live in the second house. Clue 2 says the person who had stew don't live in the second house. Clue 3 says the person who had stew don't live in the fourth house. Clue 4 says the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Clue 5 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white. Clue 6 says the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew. Clue 7 says the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. Clue 8 says there's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

Let's start with clue 7. We know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. That's a good start.

Now, let's think about clue 8. It says there's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. That means the person who likes white can't live in the first or the fifth house, 'cause there wouldn't be a house between 'em.

Now, let's think about clue 1. It says the person who likes green don't live in the second house. That's good to know.

Now, let's think about clue 2. It says the person who had stew don't live in the second house. That's good to know.

Now, let's think about clue 3. It says the person who had stew don't live in the fourth house. That's good to know.

Now, let's think about clue 4. It says the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. That's good to know.

Now, let's think about clue 5. It says the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white. That's good to know.

Now, let's think about clue 6. It says the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew. That's good to know.

Now, let's put it all together. If the person who likes white lives in the first house, then the person who likes red must live in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fifth house. But that would mean the person who likes green lives in the fifth house, which is okay, I guess.

But wait, that can't be right. If the person who likes white lives in the first house, then the person who likes red must live in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fifth house. But that would mean the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, which is not okay.

So, let's try again. If the person who likes white lives in the second house, then the person who likes red must live in the first house, the person who had stew must live in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fifth house.

Clue 3 says the cat person don't live in the second house. Clue 4 says the person wearin' loafers lives to the right of the person with a computer.

So, the history book person lives in the first house. The cat person can't live in the second house, so they must live in the first house. The person with a computer must live in the second house 'cause the history book person lives in the first house.

Now we got the computer person in the second house and the cat person in the first house. Clue 1 says the person wearin' high heels lives to the left of the person with daffodils. So, the person with daffodils must live in the second house.

From clue "
"Let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people. Each person plays a different instrument, and eats a different fruit. We gotta find out where the pianist lives.

So, the pianist and the person who eats kiwis live next to each other. That's clue number one. 

Now, the flutist lives to the right of the violinist. That's clue number two.

There's one house between the person who eats grapes and the person who eats kiwis. That's clue number three.

And there's one house between the violinist and the person who eats kiwis. That's clue number four.

Okay, so if the violinist is in the first house, the person who eats grapes is in the second house, and the person who eats kiwis is in the third house. But that don't work, 'cause the pianist and the person who eats kiwis gotta live next to each other.

If the violinist is in the second house, the person who eats grapes is in the first house, and the person who eats kiwis is in the third house. That don't work either, 'cause the pianist and the person who eats kiwis gotta live next to each other.

So, the violinist must be in the third house. The person who eats grapes is in the first house, and the person who eats kiwis is in the second house. That means the pianist is in the third house.

So, the pianist lives in house number 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"So, there's two houses next to each other, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. There's a person in each house. They like different things, like different kinds of fruit and different kinds of books.

One person's eating kiwis and one's eating oranges. One person likes history books and the other likes fantasy books.

We know the person eating kiwis lives in the first house. And we know the person who likes fantasy books doesn't live in the first house.

So, if the person eating kiwis lives in the first house, that means the person eating oranges lives in the second house. And since the person who likes fantasy books doesn't live in the first house, they must live in the second house.

So, the person who likes fantasy books lives in house number 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. That's clue 5. 

Now, clue 10 says the person who has a television lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. So, the person who has a television lives in the second house.

Clue 1 says the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other. But wait, the person who has a television is in the second house, and the person who likes yellow is in the first house. That means the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the person who has a television must be in the third house. But that can't be right, because the bird keeper and the person who likes yellow can't be next to each other. So, the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the person who has a television must be in the third house.

Now, clue 2 says the person who likes green doesn't live in the second house. That means the person who likes green lives in the first, third, or fourth house.

Clue 8 says the person who likes red lives in the third house. And clue 9 says the person who has a radio lives in the third house. So, the person who likes red and the person who has a radio both live in the third house.

Clue 7 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house. Clue 3 says the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the dog owner. But we don't know who the dog owner is yet. Clue 6 says the person who had pizza doesn't live in the third house. That means the person who had pizza must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

Clue 11 says the person who has a computer doesn't live in the second house. That means the person who has a computer lives in the first, third, or fourth house. But the person who likes red and the person who has a radio already live in the third house, so the person who has a computer must live in the first or fourth house.

Clue 4 says the cat lover lives to the right of the bird keeper. But the bird keeper lives in the second house, so the cat lover must live in the third or fourth house. But the person who likes red and the person who has a radio already live in the third house, so the cat lover must live in the fourth house.

Clue 12 says there's one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who has a television. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, and the person who has a television lives in the third house. That's one house between them, so that works.

So, the order of the houses is:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Person who likes red, has a radio, and had pizza
- House 4: Cat lover, has a computer, and ate grilled cheese

The person who likes red lives in the third house, so the answer is (D) 3."
"So, let's figure this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They like different things: one likes root beer and one likes tea. And they play different instruments: one is a pianist and one is a cellist.

We know the root beer person don't live in the second house. That's clue number one. And clue number two says the pianist lives next to the cellist, but the pianist is to the left.

So, if the pianist is to the left of the cellist, that means the pianist lives in the first house and the cellist lives in the second house. And since the root beer person can't live in the second house, they must live in the first house.

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each one's got a different person in it. Each person's got different shoes and different flowers. We gotta figure out who's where.

First, we know the person with carnations lives in the fifth house. That's clue 7.

Now, clue 1 says the person with boots and the person with carnations live next to each other. That means the person with boots lives in the fourth house.

Clue 2 says the person with tulips lives to the left of the person with loafers. But clue 6 says the person with tulips can't live in the fourth house, so they must live in the first or second house.

Clue 8 says the person with daffodils and the person with running shoes live next to each other. That means they can't live in the fourth or fifth house, 'cause the person with boots is in the fourth house, and the person with carnations is in the fifth house.

Clue 5 says the person with tulips lives to the right of the person with daffodils. So, the person with tulips can't live in the first house, 'cause that would mean the person with daffodils lives to the left of the person with tulips, but that's not possible. So, the person with tulips must live in the second house, and the person with daffodils must live in the first house.

Clue 8 says the person with running shoes lives next to the person with daffodils. So, the person with running shoes must live in the third house.

Clue 4 says there's one house between the person with running shoes and the person with lilies. That means the person with lilies must live in the third house. But wait, we already said the person with running shoes lives in the third house! That's a problem.

Let's try again. Clue 5 says the person with tulips lives to the right of the person with daffodils. So, the person with tulips must live in the third house, and the person with daffodils must live in the second house.

Clue 8 says the person with running shoes lives next to the person with daffodils. So, the person with running shoes must live in the first house.

Clue 4 says there's one house between the person with running shoes and the person with lilies. That means the person with lilies must live in the third house.

Clue 2 says the person with tulips lives to the left of the person with loafers. So, the person with loafers must live in the fourth house.

Clue 7 says the person with carnations lives in the fifth house.

So, the order of the houses is: 1 (running shoes), 2 (daffodils), 3 (tulips), 4 (loafers), 5 (carnations).

The person with lilies must live in the house that's not yet assigned, which is the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 4 houses with different people in 'em. Each person plays a different instrument, likes a different color, plays a different sport, eats a different fruit, and drinks a different drink.

From clue 1, we know there's two houses between the person who likes blue and the person who eats apples. That means the person who likes blue can't be in the first or last house.

From clue 2, the baseball player ain't in the second house.

From clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes white.

From clue 4, the swimmer lives to the left of the person who only drinks water.

So, we got swimmer, white, water, and then the person who likes blue. That's three houses.

From clue 5, there's one house between the person who eats grapes and the tennis player.

From clue 7, the saxophonist lives to the left of the tennis player.

From clue 12, the person who likes blue lives to the left of the tea drinker.

From clue 8, there's one house between the person who likes blue and the person who eats oranges.

From clue 1, there's two houses between the person who likes blue and the person who eats apples.

So, we got a bunch of clues, but I think I can figure it out.

Let's start with the first three houses: swimmer, white, water. That's what clue 4 and 3 say.

Now, the person who likes blue lives to the left of the tea drinker, so it can't be in the last house. And there's two houses between the person who likes blue and the person who eats apples, so it can't be in the first house.

So, the person who likes blue is in the third house. That means the person who eats apples is in the last house.

Now, let's look at the person who eats grapes. There's one house between the person who eats grapes and the tennis player, so the person who eats grapes is in the second house.

The saxophonist lives to the left of the tennis player, so the saxophonist is in the first house.

Now, we got the first three houses: saxophonist, grapes, tennis. But we already know the first three houses are swimmer, white, water. So, the saxophonist must be the swimmer, and the person who eats grapes must be the person who likes white.

But that can't be right, because the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. And the person who eats grapes lives to the left of the tennis player, but the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water.

So, let's try again. The person who eats grapes is in the second house, and the saxophonist is to the left of the tennis player. That means the saxophonist is in the first house.

The person who likes blue lives to the left of the tea drinker, and there's two houses between the person who likes blue and the person who eats apples. So, the person who likes blue is in the third house.

The person who eats grapes is in the second house, and the saxophonist is in the first house. That means the person who eats grapes is in the second house, and the saxophonist is in the first house.

Now, let's look at the person who eats oranges. There's one house between the person who likes blue and the person who eats oranges, so the person who eats oranges is in the fourth house.

The person who eats apples is in the last house, and the person who eats oranges is in the fourth house. That means the person who eats apples is in the third house.

Now, we got the first three houses: saxophonist, grapes, tennis. But we already know the first three houses are swimmer, white, water. So, the saxophonist must be the swimmer, and the person who eats grapes must be the person who likes white.

But that can't be right, because the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. And the person who eats grapes lives to the left of the tennis player, but the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water.

So, let's try again. The person who eats grapes is in the second house, and the saxophonist is to the left of the tennis player. That means the saxophonist is in the first house.

The person who eats apples is in the last house, and the person who eats oranges is in the fourth house. That means the person who eats apples is in the third house.

Now, we got the first three houses: saxophonist, grapes, tennis. But we already know the first three houses are swimmer, white, water. So, the saxophonist must be the swimmer, and the person who eats grapes must be the person who likes white.

The person who eats apples is in the last house, and the person who eats oranges is in the fourth house. That means the person who eats apples is in the third house.

Now, we got the first three houses: saxophonist, grapes, tennis. But we already know the first three houses are swimmer, white, water. So, the saxophonist must be the swimmer, and the person who eats grapes must be the person who likes white.

But that can't be right, because the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. And the person who eats grapes lives to the left of the tennis player, but the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water.

Now,"
"Let's figure this out. 

We know the person who likes white lives in the first house. That's clue 2. 

Now, the person who likes green lives in the second house. That's clue 4. 

The person who had stew can't live in the second house, so they must live in the first or the third house. That's clue 7.

Now, the person who wears boots lives to the left of the person who had stew. That means the person who wears boots can't live in the third house, so they must live in the first house. That's clue 6.

Now, the person who wears high heels can't live in the third house, so they must live in the second house. That's clue 1.

So, we got this so far:
- The person who likes white lives in the first house.
- The person who wears boots lives in the first house.
- The person who had stew lives in the third house.
- The person who wears high heels lives in the second house.
- The person who likes green lives in the second house.

Now, the person who ate spaghetti can't live in the second house, so they must live in the first or the third house. That's clue 3.

But, the person who wears high heels can't live in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

Now, we got this:
- The person who likes white lives in the first house.
- The person who wears boots lives in the first house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
- The person who had stew lives in the third house.
- The person who wears high heels lives in the second house.

The only one left is the person who ate fried rice. They must live in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's figure this out. We got four houses, and each house got a person in it. Each person got different flowers and likes different kinds of books. 

We know the person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house. That's clue 5. 

Now, let's look at clue 4. It says the person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other. Since the person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house.

Clue 1 says the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

Now, let's look at clue 3. It says the romance book lover lives directly left of the person with a vase of tulips. Since the person with a vase of tulips can't live in the first or second house, they must live in the fourth house. This means the romance book lover must live in the third house.

However, we already know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house. This creates a contradiction.

Let's re-examine clue 3 again. It says the romance"
"So, there's two houses next to each other, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all got different stuff:

- One person drinks coffee, the other drinks water.
- One person wears loafers, the other wears sandals.
- One person likes science fiction books, the other likes romance books.

Now, I got some clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearin' sandals.
2. The person who likes science fiction books lives in the first house.

So, the person who likes science fiction books lives in the first house. That means the coffee drinker can't live in the first house 'cause the person who likes science fiction books is already there. So, the coffee drinker must live in the second house.

Now, we got this:

- House 1: Science fiction book lover
- House 2: Coffee drinker

The only thing left is the shoes and the drink. The person in the first house can't be the coffee drinker, so they must be the water drinker. And the person in the second house is the coffee drinker, so they must be wearin' loafers.

So, the person who likes romance books must be in the first house. The correct answer is:

(B) 1"
"So, there's two houses next to each other, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. There's a person in each house, and they're different. One plays the piano and the other plays percussion. One's got a radio and the other's got a phone.

Now, I know the percussionist lives next to the person with the radio. That means the person with the radio lives in the house on the right, which is house 2.

So, the percussionist lives in house 1, and the person with the radio lives in house 2. That means the person with the phone lives in house 1.

So, the answer is (A)."
"So, there's three houses, right? And each one's got a different person in it. They all like different colors - white, blue, and yellow. And they all got different cars - a minivan, a convertible, and a sedan.

Now, let's figure this out. We know the person with the convertible lives in the second house. That's a good start.

Then, we got a clue that says there's one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes a sedan. That means they can't be next to each other.

And then there's another clue that says the person who likes yellow lives right next to the person who likes a sedan. That means the person who likes yellow can't be in the second house, 'cause that's where the convertible is.

So, if the person who likes yellow lives next to the person who likes a sedan, and they can't be in the second house, that means the person who likes yellow must be in the first house."

"So, let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people. Each person ate somethin' different: fried rice, spaghetti, and grilled cheese. And they all like different kinds of books: science fiction, fantasy, and mystery.

Now, let's look at the clues:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house too. That means the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast are in the same house.

Now, let's think about the science fiction book fanatic. They gotta live to the left of the person who ate fried rice, 'cause that's what clue 2 says. And the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house.

But wait, clue 1 says the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. That means the person who ate spaghetti can't live in the first house, 'cause the science fiction book fanatic is already there. So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

Now, we got the science fiction book fanatic in the first house, the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast in the second house, and the person who ate spaghetti in the third house. That leaves the person who ate grilled cheese. They must live in the first house, 'cause that's the only house left.

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"So, there's two houses next to each other, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. They got different flowers in their houses, one's got tulips and the other's got carnations. And they got different pets too, one's got a dog and the other's got horses.

Now, I know the person with the carnations lives to the left of the dog owner. That means if the dog owner's in the second house, the carnations person's gotta be in the first house. And if the dog owner's in the first house, the carnations person's gotta be in the second house. But we know the carnations person lives to the left of the dog owner, so the dog owner can't be in the first house. That means the dog owner's in the second house, and the carnations person's in the first house.

So, the person with the carnations lives in house number 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure this out. 

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all like different stuff: one likes milk, one likes water; one likes yellow, one likes green; one eats kiwis, one eats grapes; and one wears high heels, one wears sandals.

Now, let's look at the clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives next to the person who wears high heels.
2. The person who wears sandals lives next to the person who likes yellow.
3. The person who eats kiwis lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who eats kiwis lives in the second house. That means the person who eats grapes lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the person who wears sandals lives next to the person who likes yellow. Since the person who eats kiwis lives in the second house, the person who wears sandals must live in the first house.

Now, let's look at clue 1. It says the person who only drinks water lives next to the person who wears high heels. If the person who wears sandals lives in the first house, then the person who wears high heels must live in the second house.

So, the person who wears high heels lives in the second house. That's house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure this out. 

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all got different stuff: one's got a TV, one's got a phone. One's wearin' high heels, one's wearin' sandals. One likes tea, one only drinks water. And one's eatin' kiwis, one's eatin' grapes.

Now, let's see... The person in high heels lives to the left of the person in sandals. That's a start.

Then, we got the person eatin' grapes and the person in sandals livin' next to each other. That means the person eatin' grapes lives in the left house, and the person in sandals lives in the right house.

Now, the person who likes tea lives to the left of the person with a TV. That means the person with a TV lives in the right house, and the person who likes tea lives in the left house.

So, we got this:

- Left house: person eatin' grapes, person in high heels, person who likes tea
- Right house: person in sandals, person with a TV, person eatin' kiwis

So, the person eatin' kiwis lives in the right house, which is house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"So, there's three houses, right? And each one's got a person in it. They all like different drinks and play different instruments. 

The person who likes tea lives in the first house. That's clue number 3. 

Now, the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the cellist. That's clue number 1. So, the cellist can't be in the last house, 'cause then the water drinker would be to the left of the cellist, which don't make no sense. 

The violinist don't live in the last house, that's clue number 4. So, the violinist must be in either the first or the second house. 

Now, there's one house between the violinist and the guitarist, that's clue number 2. If the violinist is in the first house, then the guitarist would be in the last house, but we already know the violinist don't live in the last house. So, the violinist must be in the second house.

Now we got this: 
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist or Water drinker

But we know the cellist can't be in the last house, so the cellist must be in the second house. That means the water drinker is in the last house.

So, the order is: 
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker

The guitarist must be in the second house, but we already know the cellist is in the second house. So, the guitarist must be in the first house, no, wait, that's not right. The tea drinker is in the first house. So, the guitarist must be in the last house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure this out. 

We know there's a person in each house, and they all got different shoes and drink different stuff. We gotta find out where the person who only drinks water lives.

From what I know, the person with sandals lives in the third house. That's clue 1.

Now, the person with sandals lives next to the person who only drinks water, right? That's clue 3. So, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

That's it, I think. I'm pretty sure that's right."
"Let's figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each house got a different person. Each person got a different thing: phone, gameboy, computer, radio, or TV. And each person ate different food: spaghetti, pizza, stew, grilled cheese, or fried rice.

Clue 1: The person with the gameboy and the person with the computer live next to each other.

Clue 2: The person with the TV lives to the left of the person with the phone.

Clue 3: There's one house between the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a radio.

Clue 4: There's one house between the person who has a gameboy and the person who ate fried rice.

Clue 6: The person who has a radio don't live in the fourth house.

Clue 7: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

Clue 8: The person who has a computer don't live in the fourth house.

Now, let's think about this. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. That means the person who has a computer and the person who has a gameboy can't live in the fourth house. They gotta live in the first, second, or third house.

The person who has a radio don't live in the fourth house, so they gotta live in the first, second, third, or fifth house.

The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. That means the person who ate spaghetti can't live in the first house, 'cause there ain't no house to the left of the first house.

The person who has a TV lives to the left of the person who has a phone. That means the person who has a phone lives in the third or fifth house. So, the person who has a TV lives in the first, second, or third house.

Now, let's think about the person who has a gameboy. They gotta live next to the person who has a computer. And they can't live in the fourth house. So, they gotta live in the first or second house.

The person who ate fried rice lives one house to the right of the person who has a gameboy. That means they gotta live in the third or fourth house.

Now, let's put it all together. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. The person who has a computer and the person who has a gameboy live in the first or second house. The person who has a radio don't live in the fourth house, so they live in the first, second, third, or fifth house. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, so the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second or third house.

The person who has a TV lives to the left of the person who has a phone, so the person who has a phone lives in the third or fifth house. The person who ate fried rice lives one house to the right of the person who has a gameboy, so they live in the third or fourth house.

Now, let's think about it some more. The person who has a radio don't live in the fourth house, so they live in the first, second, third, or fifth house. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, so the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second or third house.

The person who has a TV lives to the left of the person who has a phone, so the person who has a phone lives in the third or fifth house. The person who ate fried rice lives one house to the right of the person who has a gameboy, so they live in the third or fourth house.

Now, let's think about it some more. The person who has a radio don't live in the fourth house, so they live in the first, second, third, or fifth house. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, so the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second or third house.

"So, let's figure this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all got different stuff goin' on.

One person plays the drums, and the other person plays the guitar. One person had pizza, and the other person had grilled cheese. And one person's got a dog, and the other person's got a bird.

Now, let's see... Clue 1 says the person who had grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird person. That means the bird person can't be in the second house, 'cause then the person who had grilled cheese would be in the same house, and that don't make no sense.

So, the bird person's gotta be in the first house. Clue 2 says the drummer ain't in the second house. That means the drummer's gotta be in the first house, but wait, we just said the bird person's in the first house. So, the drummer's gotta be in the second house.

Now we got this:
- Bird person's in the first house
- Drummer's in the second house

Clue 1 also says the person who had grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird person. That means the person who had grilled cheese is in the second house. But we already said the drummer's in the second house, and the drummer had grilled cheese. So, the person who had grilled cheese is the drummer.

"Let's figure this out. We got four houses, and each house got a person in it. Each person is eatin' a different kind of fruit: kiwis, grapes, mangos, and bananas. And each person likes a different color: green, yellow, red, and white.

Clue 1 says the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who's eatin' kiwis. Clue 2 says the person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other. Clue 3 says there's one house between the person who likes white and the person who's eatin' a banana. Clue 4 says the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. Clue 5 says there's one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes red. Clue 6 says the person who's eatin' grapes lives in the second house.

Let's start with clue 6. We know the person who's eatin' grapes lives in the second house. Now, we gotta figure out who's in the other houses.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other. Since the person who's eatin' grapes lives in the second house, the person who likes green and the person who likes red can't be in the second house. So, they must be in the first and third houses, or the second and fourth houses. But since the person who's eatin' grapes lives in the second house, the person who likes green and the person who likes red can't be in the second and fourth houses. So, they must be in the first and third houses.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes green and the person who likes red are in the first and third houses, the person who likes yellow must be in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know there's one house between the person who likes white and the person who's eatin' a banana. Since the person who's eatin' a banana can't be in the first house (because the person who's eatin' kiwis is in the first house), the person who's eatin' a banana must be in the fourth house. So, the person who likes white must be in the second house.

But wait, we already know the person who's eatin' grapes lives in the second house. So, the person who likes white must be eatin' grapes, and the person who's eatin' grapes must be eatin' a different fruit. That's a problem.

Let's try again. From clue 6, we know the person who's eatin' grapes lives in the second house. From clue 2, we know the person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other. Since the person who's eatin' grapes lives in the second house, the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in the first and third houses, or the second and fourth houses. But since the person who's eatin' grapes lives in the second house, the person who likes green and the person who likes red can't be in the second and fourth houses.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes green and the person who likes red are in the first and third houses, the person who likes yellow must be in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know there's one house between the person who likes white and the person who's eatin' a banana. Since the person who's eatin' a banana can't be in the first house (because the person who's eatin' kiwis is in the first house), the person who's eatin' a banana must be in the fourth house.

"Let's figure this out. 

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all like different stuff. 

One person had stew, one had fried rice. One person likes horses, one likes cats. One person is eating oranges, one is eating apples. One person likes mystery books, one likes science fiction. And one person is wearin' running shoes, one is wearin' sandals.

Now, let's see what we got here. The person wearin' running shoes lives to the right of the person eatin' oranges. That's clue number one.

The person who likes mystery books lives next to the cat person. That's clue number two.

And the person who likes mystery books and the person who had stew live next to each other. That's clue number three.

Now, let's think about it. If the person who likes mystery books lives next to the cat person, and they live next to the person who had stew, that means the person who had stew must be the cat person.

Now, let's think about the person who's eatin' oranges. They can't be the cat person, 'cause the cat person had stew. So, they must be eatin' oranges. And they can't be wearin' running shoes, 'cause the person wearin' running shoes lives to the right of the person eatin' oranges. So, the person eatin' oranges must be wearin' sandals.

Now, let's put it all together. The person who had stew (the cat person) lives next to the person who likes mystery books. The person who's eatin' oranges (not the cat person) is wearin' sandals. And the person who's wearin' running shoes lives to the right of the person who's eatin' oranges.

So, the only way it can work is:

House 1: Person eatin' oranges (sandals) - person who likes mystery books
House 2: Person who had stew (cat person) - person wearin' running shoes

So, the person who had stew lives in house 2. The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people. Each person got different flowers, drinks, and devices. We gotta find out where the person who likes milk lives.

From clue 1, we know the person with daffodils lives left of the person with a phone. That means the person with daffodils can't be in the first house, 'cause the person with a phone can't be in the first house neither. So the person with daffodils must be in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. But wait, we just said the person with daffodils lives in the second house. That means the person with daffodils must be the person who only drinks water.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in the first house. So the person with daffodils ain't the root beer lover.

From clue 5, we know the person with a television lives to the right of the person with tulips. That means the person with tulips must be in the first house, and the person with a television must be in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person with a television don't live in the second house. That's already known.

Now we know the first house has tulips, the second house has daffodils, and the third house has a television. The person with a phone must be in the second house, 'cause the person with daffodils lives left of the person with a phone.

We still don't know who likes milk. Let's think about it. The person with a computer, television, or phone must be in the second or third house. The person with a computer can't be in the third house, 'cause the person with a television lives there. So the person with a computer must be in the second house.

The person with a phone is in the second house, and the person with a computer is in the second house. That means the person with a phone and the person with a computer are the same person. But that's not possible, 'cause the person with a phone lives left of the person with daffodils, and the person with a computer lives in the second house. So the person with a computer must be in the third house.

Now we know the first house has tulips, the second house has daffodils and a phone, and the third house has a computer and a television. The person with a computer lives in the third house, and the person with a television lives in the third house. That means the person with a computer and the person with a television are the same person.

The person with a computer and a television lives in the third house, and the person with a phone lives in the second house. The person with a computer, television, and phone can't be the same person, so the person with a computer and a television must be the person who likes milk.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's figure this out. 

We know the person in the first house is wearin' loafers. That's clue number one. 

Now, the person with a phone lives to the left of the person eatin' mangos. That means the person with a phone can't be in the third house, 'cause the person eatin' mangos can't be in the first house. So the person with a phone is in the first house.

The person eatin' grapes lives to the left of the person drinkin' water. That means the person eatin' grapes is in the first house, and the person drinkin' water is in the second house.

Now, the person eatin' kiwis can't be in the first house, 'cause that's already taken. And the person eatin' kiwis lives to the left of the person drinkin' milk. That means the person eatin' kiwis is in the second house, and the person drinkin' milk is in the third house.

The person with a gameboy can't be in the first house, 'cause the person with a phone is there. And the person wearin' boots can't be in the third house, 'cause that's already taken. So the person with a gameboy is in the second house, and the person wearin' boots is in the first house... no, wait, that can't be right. The person wearin' boots can't be in the first house, 'cause the person wearin' loafers is there. So the person with a gameboy is in the second house, and the person wearin' boots is in the third house.

Now, the person with a computer can't be in the first house, 'cause that's already taken. And the person with a computer can't be in the third house, 'cause that's already taken too. So the person with a computer is in the second house.

The answer is (C) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got three houses, and three people, and they all like different things. One likes baseball, one likes golf, and one likes cricket. One has carnations, one has daffodils, and one has roses. And one likes fish, one likes horses, and one likes cats.

Clue 1 says the golfer don't live in the third house. Clue 2 says the fish person lives to the left of the horse person. Clue 3 says the golfer and the baseball person live next to each other. Clue 4 says the person with carnations and the horse person live next to each other. Clue 5 says the person with carnations lives to the left of the baseball person. Clue 6 says the person with roses lives to the left of the person with daffodils. Clue 7 says the cricket person don't live in the third house.

Okay, so let's start with clue 6. If the person with roses lives to the left of the person with daffodils, that means the person with roses must be in the first house, and the person with daffodils must be in the third house.

Now, let's look at clue 4. If the person with carnations and the horse person live next to each other, that means the person with carnations must be in the first house, and the horse person must be in the second house.

But wait, clue 5 says the person with carnations lives to the left of the baseball person. So, the person with carnations must be in the first house, and the baseball person must be in the second house.

Now, let's look at clue 2. If the fish person lives to the left of the horse person, that means the fish person must be in the first house, and the horse person must be in the second house.

But wait, clue 3 says the golfer and the baseball person live next to each other. So, the golfer must be in the third house, and the baseball person must be in the second house.

Now, let's put it all together:

1. The person with roses lives in the first house.
2. The person with carnations lives in the first house.
3. The person with daffodils lives in the third house.
4. The person with horses lives in the second house.
5. The person with baseball lives in the second house.
6. The person with golf lives in the third house.

So, the person with horses lives in the second house. The answer is:

(C) 2"
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got three houses, and three people, and they all got different stuff. One's got a bird, one's got a dog, and one's got horses. One's got a convertible, one's got a truck, and one's got a sedan. And they all eat different fruits: one's got a banana, one's got mangos, and one's got oranges.

We know the person with oranges lives in the first house. That's clue number one. 

Now, let's think about the truck. The person with the truck lives to the left of the person with the convertible. That's clue number two.

We also know the bird keeper lives to the right of the dog owner. That's clue number three.

The person with mangos don't live in the third house. That's clue number four.

The person with horses lives in the third house. That's clue number five.

And the person with mangos and the person with the convertible live next to each other. That's clue number six.

Okay, so the person with oranges lives in the first house. That means the person with mangos can't live in the third house, so they must live in the second house. And since the person with mangos and the person with the convertible live next to each other, the person with the convertible must live in the third house.

Now, we know the person with the truck lives to the left of the person with the convertible. That means the person with the truck must live in the second house. But wait, we already said the person with mangos lives in the second house. This can't be right.

Let's try again. The person with oranges lives in the first house. The person with mangos lives in the second house. And the person with the convertible lives in the third house. But this can't be right, because the person with the truck lives to the left of the person with the convertible.

I think I got it now. The person with oranges lives in the first house. The person with the truck lives in the second house. And the person with mangos lives in the third house. But this can't be right, because the person with mangos and the person with the convertible live next to each other.

Wait a minute... I got it! The person with oranges lives in the first house. The person with the truck lives in the second house. And the person with mangos lives in the third house. But the person with mangos and the person with the convertible live next to each other, so the person with the convertible must live in the third house. And the person with the truck must live in the second house.

So, the person with the truck lives in the second house. That's option A."
"Let's figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each person in 'em is different. They all like different books and eat different food, and they all play different instruments.

From clue 1, the percussionist lives left of the person who had stew. That's a good start.

From clue 3, the science fiction book fanatic lives left of the percussionist. So, we got: science fiction book fanatic, percussionist, and then the person who had stew.

From clue 7, the guitarist lives left of the percussionist. So, we got: guitarist, science fiction book fanatic, percussionist, and then the person who had stew.

From clue 5, the mystery book reader lives left of the romance book lover. And from clue 9, there's one house between the mystery book reader and the history book buff. So, we got: mystery book reader, romance book lover, history book buff.

From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese lives right of the mystery book reader. So, we got: mystery book reader, person who ate grilled cheese, romance book lover, history book buff.

From clue 4, there are two houses between the person who had pizza and the saxophonist. That means the saxophonist can't be in the first or second house. And from clue 2, the percussionist lives right of the mystery book reader. So, the percussionist can't be in the first house.

From clue 6, the fantasy book enthusiast lives left of the flutist. And from clue 10, the person who ate spaghetti doesn't live in the third house.

Now, let's put it all together. We got: guitarist, science fiction book fanatic, percussionist, mystery book reader, person who ate grilled cheese, romance book lover, history book buff, person who had stew, person who ate spaghetti, person who had pizza, and saxophonist, and fantasy book enthusiast, and flutist.

"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 5 houses and 5 people, and each person is different in some way. They all got different cars, like a minivan, a convertible, a truck, an SUV, and a sedan. They all like different kinds of books, like fantasy, romance, science fiction, mystery, and history. They all eat different fruits, like grapes, apples, bananas, mangos, and oranges. They all like different colors, like red, green, white, yellow, and blue. And they all ate different things for lunch, like fried rice, stew, pizza, grilled cheese, and spaghetti.

Okay, so the person who ate grilled cheese don't live in the third house (clue 1). The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house (clue 2). The romance book lover lives in the third house (clue 10). The person who ate fried rice don't live in the first house (clue 4). The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes white (clue 5). There's one house between the science fiction book fanatic and the person who's eating a banana (clue 6). There's two houses between the person who had pizza and the person who ate fried rice (clue 7). The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who likes green (clue 8). The person who likes red don't live in the first house (clue 9). The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the mystery book reader (clue 11). The person who's eating mangos lives to the right of the person who owns an SUV (clue 12). The person who likes white don't live in the fourth house (clue 13). The history book buff don't live in the fifth house (clue 14). There's one house between the person who's eating apples and the person who drives a minivan (clue 15). The science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese (clue 16). The person who's eating apples and the person who likes yellow live next to each other (clue 17). The person who's eating grapes lives to the left of the romance book lover (clue 18).

Let's see... The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house. The romance book lover lives in the third house. The person who's eating grapes lives to the left of the romance book lover, so that's the second house. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who likes green, but we don't know who that is yet.

"Let's figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each one's got a person in it. Each person likes a different color, plays a different instrument, and has a different device.

From clue 1, the percussionist and the guitarist live next to each other. That's a good start.

From clue 7, the person who likes green lives in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who has a radio lives in the third house. So, the person who likes green and the person who has a radio live in the third house.

From clue 12, the person who has a computer lives to the left of the person who has a phone. And from clue 11, the person who has a computer doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who has a computer must live in the first house.

From clue 12, the person who has a phone lives to the right of the person who has a computer. So, the person who has a phone must live in the second house.

From clue 9, the person who likes red doesn't live in the second house. And from clue 3, the person who has a TV lives to the left of the person who likes red. So, the person who has a TV must live in the fourth house.

From clue 8, the percussionist lives to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white can't live in the first house (because the person who has a computer lives there), the person who likes white must live in the fifth house. So, the percussionist must live in the fourth house.

From clue 1, the percussionist and the guitarist live next to each other. So, the guitarist must live in the third house.

From clue 4, there's one house between the guitarist and the person who likes yellow. Since the guitarist lives in the third house, the person who likes yellow must live in the fifth house.

"Let's figure this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all like different stuff: one likes tea, one likes root beer; one plays the cello, one plays the guitar; one likes horses, one likes cats; and one likes mystery books, one likes history books.

We got some clues. The cello player lives to the left of the mystery book person. That's clue number one. The history book person lives to the left of the cat person. That's clue number two. And the root beer person and the guitar person live next to each other. That's clue number three.

Let's start with the history book person and the cat person. They gotta be next to each other, but one has to be to the left of the other. So, they can be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 1. But we don't know which one is which yet.

Now, let's think about the cello player and the mystery book person. The cello player lives to the left of the mystery book person. So, if the history book person is in house 1, the cello player has to be in house 1 too, and the mystery book person has to be in house 2. But if the history book person is in house 2, the cello player has to be in house 2, and the mystery book person has to be in house 1.

Now, let's think about the root beer person and the guitar person. They live next to each other, so they can be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 1. But they can't be in the same house as the person who likes horses, because that person is not the cello player, the history book person, the cat person, or the mystery book person.

So, let's try to put it all together. If the history book person is in house 1, the cat person is in house 2. The cello player is in house 1, and the mystery book person is in house 2. The root beer person and the guitar person can be in houses 2 and 1, or 1 and 2. But the cello player is in house 1, so the root beer person and the guitar person have to be in houses 2 and 1.

If the history book person is in house 2, the cat person is in house 1. The cello player is in house 2, and the mystery book person is in house 1. The root beer person and the guitar person can be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 1. But the cello player is in house 2, so the root beer person and the guitar person have to be in houses 1 and 2.

Now, let's think about the person who likes horses. They can't be the cello player, the history book person, the cat person, or the mystery book person. They can only be the root beer person or the guitar person. But the root beer person and the guitar person live next to each other, so they can't be in the same house as the person who likes horses.

So, the person who likes horses has to be in house 1, and the root beer person and the guitar person have to be in houses 2 and 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure this out. 

We got three houses, and three people. Each person has different pets and different flowers. 

One person has a carnations arrangement, one has a vase of tulips, and one has a rose bouquet. And one person has a dog, one has a cat, and one has a bird.

From what I know, the person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper. That means the bird keeper can't be in the third house, 'cause then the person with carnations would be in the fourth house, but we only got three houses.

Now, the dog owner can't be in the second house. That means the dog owner is either in the first or the third house.

The person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner. If the dog owner is in the first house, then the person with tulips is in the second house. If the dog owner is in the third house, then the person with tulips would be in the fourth house, but we only got three houses, so that can't be right.

So, the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person with tulips must be in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure dis out. 

From clue 4, we know the swimmer lives in the fourth house.

From clue 6, we know the person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person with a vase of tulips must live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person with a vase of tulips. Therefore, the person wearing high heels must live in the first house.

From clue 7, we know the person with a phone lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since the person with a vase of tulips lives in the second house, the person with a phone must live in the first house. However, we already know the person wearing high heels lives in the first house. This means the person with a phone must live in the second house.

From clue 8, we know the person eating oranges lives to the left of the person with a computer. Since the person with a vase of tulips lives in the second house, the person eating oranges must live in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing loafers does not live in the second house. Since the person with a phone lives in the second house, the person wearing loafers must live in the third house.

From clue 12, we know the person with a gameboy lives to the left of the basketball player. Since the person with a vase of tulips lives in the second house, the person with a gameboy must live in the first house. However, we already know the person eating oranges lives in the first house. This means the person with a gameboy must live in the third house.

From clue 8, we know the person eating oranges lives to the left of the person with a computer.

Since the person with a vase of tulips lives in the second house, the person with a gameboy must live in the first house. However, we already know the person wearing loafers lives in the first house. This means the person with a gameboy must live in the second house.

From clue 11, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person eating a banana. Since the person with a vase of tulips lives in the second house, the person with a rose bouquet must live in the first house. However, we already know the person wearing loafers lives in the first house. This means the person with a rose bouquet must live in the third house.

From clue 12, we know the person with a gameboy lives to the left of the basketball player.

From clue 12"
"Let's figure this out. 

We got four houses, and each one's got a different person in it. They all got different pets and eat different fruits. 

One person's eatin' mangos, and that's the first house. 

Now, the person with the horses don't live in the first house. That's all we know so far.

Next, the bird keeper and the person eatin' kiwis, they live right next to each other. That's a clue.

The person eatin' a banana don't live in the third house. That's another clue.

The person with the horses don't live in the second house. That's another one.

And the person eatin' a banana lives right next to the person with the dog. That's the last clue.

Now, let's put it all together. The person eatin' mangos is in the first house. The person eatin' a banana lives next to the person with the dog, so the banana person's gotta be in the second house, and the dog person's gotta be in the third house.

Now we got:
- House 1: Person eatin' mangos
- House 2: Person eatin' banana
- House 3: Person with the dog

The bird keeper and the person eatin' kiwis live next to each other. Since the banana person's in the second house, the bird keeper and the person eatin' kiwis gotta be in the first and third houses, but we already know the first house is taken by the person eatin' mangos. So, the bird keeper's gotta be in the third house, and the person eatin' kiwis is in the fourth house.

So, the bird keeper lives in the third house. That's the answer.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"I don't rightly know how to do this puzzle, but I'll give it a shot. 

So, there's three houses, and three people in 'em. Each person likes a different kind of book: mystery, history, and romance. And each person's got a different pet: a cat, a bird, and horses. 

Now, I know the person who likes mystery books lives in the first house. That's clue number one. 

Clue number two says the person who likes romance books don't live in the third house. And clue number three says the person who's got a bird lives next to the person who likes history books. 

Now, if the person who likes mystery books lives in the first house, and the person who's got a bird lives next to the person who likes history books, that means the person who's got a bird must live in the second house, and the person who likes history books must live in the third house. 

Clue number two also says the person who's got horses don't live in the third house. So, the person who's got horses must live in the first house or the second house. But we already know the person who likes mystery books lives in the first house, so the person who's got horses must live in the second house.

Now, we got the person who's got a bird in the second house, and the person who's got horses in the second house. That means the person who's got a bird and the person who's got horses must be in the same house, but that's not possible. So, I made a mistake.

Let me try again. If the person who likes mystery books lives in the first house, and the person who's got a bird lives next to the person who likes history books, that means the person who's got a bird must live in the second house, and the person who likes history books must live in the third house. 

Clue number two says the person who likes romance books don't live in the third house. So, the person who likes romance books must live in the first house or the second house. But we already know the person who likes mystery books lives in the first house, so the person who likes romance books must live in the second house.

So, the person who likes romance books lives in the second house. That's my answer.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 4 houses, and each one's got a person in it. They all like different drinks and eat different fruits. Here's what we know:

- One person likes root beer, one likes coffee, one only drinks water, and one likes tea.
- One person eats mangos, one eats apples, one eats kiwis, and one eats grapes.

Now, let's see what we got:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person eating apples lives next to the person who only drinks water.
3. The person eating mangos don't live in the first house.
4. The person eating mangos don't live in the third house.
5. The person eating apples lives to the left of the person who likes tea.
6. The person eating kiwis don't live in the third house.

Okay, so the coffee drinker lives in the second house. That's a start.

Now, let's think about the person eating apples. They live next to the person who only drinks water, and they live to the left of the person who likes tea. That means the person eating apples can't live in the second house, 'cause that's where the coffee drinker lives. So, the person eating apples must live in the first house.

Now, the person who only drinks water lives next to the person eating apples, so they must live in the third house.

So, we got this so far:

1. Person eating apples
2. Coffee drinker
3. Person who only drinks water
4. ? (we don't know yet)

Now, the person eating mangos don't live in the first house, and they don't live in the third house. That means they must live in the fourth house.

And the person eating kiwis don't live in the third house, so they must live in the second house is not possible because the coffee drinker lives there. So, the person eating kiwis must live in the first house is not possible because the person eating apples lives there. So, the person eating kiwis must live in the fourth house is not possible because the person eating mangos lives there. So, the person eating kiwis must live in the second house is not possible because the coffee drinker lives there. So, the person eating kiwis must live in the third house.

So, we got this:

1. Person eating apples
2. Coffee drinker
3. Person eating kiwis
4. Person eating mangos

The coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's figure this out. 

From clue 9, we know the person who likes white lives in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red. So, the person who likes red must live in the third house.

From clue 12, we know the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the soccer player lives in the third house. But we already know the person who likes red lives in the third house, so the soccer player must be the person who likes red.

From clue 8, we know the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

From clue 11, we know the person who likes green lives in the fifth house. Since the baseball player lives in the fifth house, the person who likes green must be the baseball player.

From clue 10, we know there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the baseball player lives in the fifth house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the person who is eating oranges lives in the first house, the golfer must live in the second house. But we already know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house. So, the golfer must live in the first house, and the person who is eating oranges must be the person who is eating kiwis.

From clue 6, we know the cricketer does not live in the fifth house. Since the person who likes green lives in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth house.

From clue 6, we know the cricketer lives in the fourth house. Since the person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house, the cricketer must be the person who is eating apples.

From clue 8, we know the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house.

So, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house. The correct answer is:

(D) 3"
"Let's figure this out. 

First, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. That's a given.

Now, we gotta think about the rose bouquet. It's gotta be next to the spaghetti eater, right? So, the spaghetti eater is in the third house, and the person with the rose bouquet is in the first house.

The golfer is to the right of the person with the rose bouquet, so the golfer is in the third house. That's the same house as the spaghetti eater. 

Now, the person who had stew is to the right of the person in high heels. That means the person in high heels can't be in the third house, so they're in the first house. The person who had stew is in the second house.

The history book buff is to the right of the person who had stew, so the history book buff is in the third house. But we already said the golfer is in the third house, so the history book buff and the golfer are the same person. That's not possible, so we gotta rethink this.

Let's try again. The person who had stew is to the right of the person in high heels, and the history book buff is to the right of the person who had stew. That means the person in high heels is in the first house, the person who had stew is in the second house, and the history book buff is in the third house.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet is in the first house, and the person with the rose bouquet is next to the spaghetti eater. That means the spaghetti eater is in the third house, and the person with the rose bouquet is in the first house.

The person with the daffodils is to the left of the golfer, and there's one house between them. That means the person with the daffodils is in the first house, and the golfer is in the third house.

Now we got:
- House 1: person with high heels, person with daffodils, mystery book reader
- House 2: person who had stew, running shoes, soccer player
- House 3: person who ate spaghetti, history book buff, golfer

The only one left is the person with the carnations. The person in the second house is wearing running shoes, and the person in the first house is wearing high heels. That means the person in the second house is the soccer player, and the person in the first house is wearing high heels. The person in the second house is wearing running shoes, the person in the first house is wearing high heels, and the person in the third house is wearing loafers. The person in the first house has a bouquet of daffodils, the person in the second house has carnations, and the person in the third house has a rose bouquet.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people in 'em. Each person plays a different instrument: flutist, percussionist, and cellist. Each person wears different shoes: boots, high heels, and loafers. Each person has a different device: gameboy, phone, and television. And each person drives a different car: convertible, minivan, and truck.

Clue 1 says the person with a phone lives to the left of the person with a minivan. Clue 2 says the person with a truck and the person with a gameboy live next to each other. Clue 3 says the person with a minivan and the cellist live next to each other. Clue 4 says the person with high heels and the person with a television live next to each other. Clue 5 says the person with a minivan lives to the right of the person with a truck. Clue 6 says the flutist lives to the left of the person with a minivan. Clue 7 says the person with boots lives to the right of the percussionist.

Let's start with clue 2. If the person with a truck and the person with a gameboy live next to each other, that means they can be in either the first or second house. But clue 5 says the person with a minivan lives to the right of the person with a truck. So, the person with a truck must be in the first house, and the person with a minivan must be in the third house.

Now, clue 6 says the flutist lives to the left of the person with a minivan. So, the flutist must be in the first house. Clue 1 says the person with a phone lives to the left of the person with a minivan. So, the person with a phone must be in the first house, but we already know the flutist is in the first house. This means the person with a phone must be the flutist.

Now, we know the person with a truck is in the first house, the person with a minivan is in the third house, and the flutist is in the first house. Clue 3 says the person with a minivan and the cellist live next to each other. So, the cellist must be in the third house.

Now, we know the person with a truck is in the first house, the person with a minivan is in the third house, the flutist is in the first house, and the cellist is in the third house. Clue 4 says the person with high heels and the person with a television live next to each other. So, the person with high heels and the person with a television must be in the second and third houses, but we already know the person with a minivan and the cellist are in the third house. This means the person with high heels must be in the second house, and the person with a television must be in the third house.

Clue 1 says the person with a phone lives to the left of the person with a minivan. We already know the person with a phone is the flutist, and the flutist is in the first house. This means the person with a phone is in the first house.

Now, we know the person with a truck is in the first house, the person with a minivan is in the third house, the flutist is in the first house, the cellist is in the third house, the person with high heels is in the second house, the person with a television is in the third house, the person with boots is in the third house, the person with a gameboy is in the first house, and the person with a phone is in the first house.

"Let's figure this out. 

From clue 5, we know the person with daffodils lives in the second house.

From clue 13, we know the person with daffodils lives left of the person with a TV. So, the person with a TV lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person with a TV lives left of the person with lilies. So, the person with lilies lives in the fourth house.

From clue 10, we know the person with lilies lives left of the pianist. So, the pianist lives in the fifth house.

From clue 6, we know the person eating grapes lives in the fifth house. But we also know the pianist lives in the fifth house, so the person eating grapes is the pianist.

From clue 11, we know the violinist and the person eating oranges live next to each other. From clue 12, we know the person eating oranges lives left of the saxophonist. So, the order of the first three houses is: violinist, person eating oranges, saxophonist.

From clue 2, we know the person eating mangos lives right of the violinist. But we already know the person eating grapes lives in the fifth house, so the person eating mangos can't live in the fifth house. 

From clue 7, we know the person with a gameboy and the guitarist live next to each other. Since the person eating grapes lives in the fifth house, the person with a gameboy and the guitarist must live in the first and second houses.

From clue 3, we know the person with a gameboy lives left of the person with carnations. Since the person with a gameboy lives in the first house, the person with carnations lives in the third house.

From clue 8, we know the person with a phone lives left of the person with a radio. Since the person with a gameboy lives in the first house, the person with a phone lives in the second house, and the person with a radio lives in the third house.

"Let's figure this out. 

We got three houses, and each house got a different person. Each person got different flowers, drinks, and cars. We gotta find out where the coffee drinker lives.

We know the person with lilies lives in the second house. That's clue 5.

Now, clue 3 says the person with an SUV lives left of the coffee drinker. That means the person with an SUV can't live in the second house 'cause that's where the lilies are. So, the person with an SUV must live in the first house.

Clue 2 says the person with a rose lives left of the coffee drinker. But we already know the person with an SUV lives in the first house, and the person with lilies lives in the second house. So, the person with a rose must live in the third house.

From what I know, the person who likes blue lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. That means the blue person is on the left, and the spaghetti person is on the right of them.

Now, the person who had stew lives to the left of the person with lilies. That means the stew person can't be on the right, 'cause then they'd be to the left of the lilies person, but the spaghetti person would be to the right of the stew person, which don't make sense.

So, the stew person must be on the left. The blue person is on the left, so the stew person must be in the first house. The lilies person is on the right, so they're in the third house.

Now, the person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who had stew. That means the minivan person is in the first house with the stew person.

The person who has a rose bouquet lives next to the person who drives a truck. That means the rose person is on the left, and the truck person is on the right.

Now we got a problem. The rose person is in the second house, but the daffodils person is in the second house too. That don't make sense. So, the minivan person must be in the second house, and the daffodils person is in the first house.

The rose person lives next to the truck person, so the rose person is in the second house, and the truck person is in the third house.

So, the person who drives a truck lives in the third house. That's option (A) 3."

"Let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people. Each person is different. One's wearin' boots, one's wearin' running shoes, and one's wearin' sandals. One's got a gameboy, one's got a phone, and one's got a TV. One likes blue, one likes red, and one likes white. And they're all eatin' different fruits: mangos, grapes, and apples.

Now, let's see what we got here. Clue number one says the person eatin' grapes lives to the right of the person who likes red. That means the person who likes red can't be in the last house.

Clue number three says there's one house between the person eatin' apples and the person wearin' sandals. That means the person eatin' apples can't be in the last house, and the person wearin' sandals can't be in the first house.

Clue number four says the person with a gameboy lives in the last house. Clue number five says the person who likes red lives in the second house. Clue number six says the person who likes white lives to the left of the person eatin' grapes.

"Let's figure this out. 

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all like different stuff. 

One person drinks tea, one person drinks water. One person likes romance books, one person likes science fiction. One person plays the saxophone, one person plays percussion. One person likes golf, one person likes baseball. One person eats mangos, one person eats grapes.

Now, let's look at the clues:

1. The person who drinks tea and the person who eats grapes live next to each other.
2. The person who plays the saxophone and the person who likes golf live next to each other.
3. The person who likes baseball and the person who eats grapes live next to each other.
4. The person who plays the saxophone lives in the first house.
5. The person who likes romance books and the person who likes golf live next to each other.

From clue 4, the saxophonist lives in the first house. Since the saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other (clue 2), the golfer must live in the second house.

From clue 5, the romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other. Since the golfer lives in the second house, the romance book lover must live in the first house.

From clue 2, the saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other, and we already know the golfer lives in the second house. This means the saxophonist lives in the first house, which we already know.

From clue 1, the tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the saxophonist lives in the first house, the tea drinker must live in the second house.

From clue 3, the baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the tea drinker lives in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must live in the first house.

Now we got this:
- The saxophonist lives in the first house.
- The romance book lover lives in the first house.
- The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house.
- The tea drinker lives in the second house.
- The golfer lives in the second house.

Since the person who is eating grapes lives in the first house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the second house.

The answer is (B)"
"Let's figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each house got a person with different stuff. They all like different things, like fruits, instruments, shoes, colors, and books.

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives left of the person who likes blue. That's all we know so far.

From clue 2, the person who eats apples lives left of the mystery book reader. That means the mystery book reader lives in the 5th house.

From clue 3, there's two houses between the pianist and the person with sandals. That's all we know so far.

From clue 4, the person who eats grapes don't live in the first house.

The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

The answer is (D)."
"Let's figure this out. 

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There's a person in each house. They all like different stuff: different colors, fruits, books, cars, and shoes.

Clue 1 says the person eating grapes lives next to the person driving a truck. That means the person eating grapes lives in the left house, and the person driving a truck lives in the right house.

Clue 3 says the person who likes yellow lives next to the person driving a truck. Since the person driving a truck lives in the right house, the person who likes yellow lives in the left house.

Now we know the left house has the person who likes yellow and eats grapes. That means the person in the right house likes red, 'cause the other person likes yellow.

Clue 2 says the person wearing boots lives next to the mystery book reader. Since the person in the left house likes yellow and eats grapes, the person in the right house must be the mystery book reader and wear boots.

Now we got this:

- Left house: person who likes yellow, eats grapes, and wears running shoes
- Right house: person who likes red, eats oranges, is a mystery book reader, and wears boots

The only thing left is the car. The person in the left house likes yellow and eats grapes, so the person in the right house likes red and eats oranges. The person in the right house is a mystery book reader, so the person in the left house must like fantasy books.

So, the person who likes fantasy books lives in the left house, which is house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each person's got a favorite color, a car, and they ate somethin' different for lunch. We gotta figure out who lives in which house.

From clue 9, we know the person who likes green lives in the third house. That's a good start.

From clue 8, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. That means the person who drives a minivan can't be in the first house, 'cause then the person who drives a truck would be in the second house, and there ain't no room for the person who likes green in the third house.

From clue 7, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader. That means the person who drives a minivan lives in the second house, and the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.

From clue 13, the romance book lover lives directly left of the mystery book reader. That means the romance book lover lives in the third house.

From clue 1, the history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. That means the history book buff can't live in the first house, 'cause then the person who had stew would be in the second house, and the person who drives a minivan would be in the third house, and the romance book lover would be in the fourth house, and the mystery book reader would be in the fifth house. That's too many people in the third house.

From clue 3, the history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. That means the person who owns an SUV can't live in the first house, 'cause then the history book buff would be in the second house, and the person who drives a minivan would be in the third house, and the romance book lover would be in the fourth house, and the mystery book reader would be in the fifth house. That's too many people in the second house.

From clue 2, there are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the person who had stew lives. That means the person who had stew lives in the fifth house, and the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.

From clue 10, there is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives. That means the person who drives a convertible lives in the fifth house, and the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. That means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house.

From clue 6, the person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. That means the person who likes white can't live in the first house, 'cause then the person who likes blue would be in the second house, and the person who drives a minivan would be in the third house, and the romance book lover would be in the fourth house, and the mystery book reader would be in the fifth house. That's too many people in the second house.

From clue 4, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic. That means the person who likes blue lives in the second house, and the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

From clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes blue. That means the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house, and the person who likes blue lives in the second house.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. That means the person who had pizza lives in the first house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the fifth house.

From clue 12, the person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. That means the person who drives a minivan lives in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

The answer is (E)."

"So, let's figure this out. We got three houses, and three people. Each person plays a different instrument and a different sport. We gotta find out where the soccer player lives.

We know the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer. That means the cellist can't be in the first house, 'cause if they were, the cricketer would be to the left of the cellist, not the other way around.

We also know the basketball player lives in the second house. And the violinist lives in the second house too. But they can't be the same person, so they must be in the second house together.

Now, the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer, so the cellist must be in the third house. That leaves the first house for the soccer player. The soccer player can't be in the second house 'cause that's where the basketball player and violinist are. And they can't be in the third house 'cause that's where the cellist is.

So, the soccer player must be in the first house.

The answer is (A)."

"Let's figure this out. We got four houses, and each house got a person in it. Each person plays a different instrument, got a different pet, likes a different drink, and plays a different sport.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes milk don't live in the third house. That's all we know from that clue.

"So, let's figure this out. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. They're next to each other. There's a person in each house. They got different flowers in their house, and they play different instruments.

We know one person got a bouquet of daffodils, and one person is a pianist. And we know the pianist lives in the second house. That's a big clue right there.

So, if the pianist lives in the second house, that means the person with the daffodils can't live in the second house, 'cause they gotta live next to each other. That means the person with the daffodils lives in the first house.

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure this out. We got 5 houses, and each house got a person in it. Each person is eatin' a different kind of fruit, and they all got different cars and flowers in their foyer.

From clue 1, we know the person with tulips lives to the left of the person with a convertible. That means the person with tulips is in the first or second house.

From clue 2, we know the person eatin' oranges is in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person eatin' apples lives to the left of the person with daffodils. That means the person with daffodils is in the third or fourth house.

From clue 8, we know the person eatin' grapes ain't in the fifth house. That means the person eatin' grapes is in the second, third, or fifth house.

From clue 9, we know the person with an SUV is in the fourth house.

Now, let's put it all together. The person with tulips is in the first house, and the person with oranges is in the first house. That means the person with tulips is in the second house. The person with apples is in the second house, but that's already taken by the person with tulips. So, the person with apples is in the third house. The person with daffodils is in the third house, but that's already taken by the person with apples. So, the person with daffodils is in the fourth house. The person with a minivan is in the fourth house, but that's already taken by the person with daffodils. So, the person with a minivan is in the fifth house.

Now, we got the person with carnations in the second house, and the person with lilies is in the fifth house. The person with a sedan is in the third house.

The answer is (A) 3."

"So, there's two houses next to each other, one's number 1 and the other's number 2. There's a person in each house, and they're all different. One person likes cats, one likes birds, one has a computer, one has a gameboy, one plays the violin, and one plays the guitar.

We know the violinist lives in the first house. That's a start. Now, we gotta figure out who's in the second house. We know the person with the computer lives to the left of the bird keeper. Since the violinist is in the first house, the person with the computer must be in the first house too. That's because there ain't no house to the left of the first house.

So, the first house has the violinist and the computer. Now we gotta figure out who's in the second house. The person in the second house has a gameboy, a guitar, and a bird. That's it. They can't have a cat, a computer, or a violin.

So, the bird keeper lives in the second house."
"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got 5 houses with different people in 'em. Each person's got different stuff: flowers, shoes, devices, food, and books. I'll just go through the clues and see what I can figure out.

Clue 1 says the person wearin' boots lives in the second house. That's a good start.

Clue 4 says the person with a rose bouquet lives in the first house. That's easy, 'cause we already know the person in the first house is the gameboy user.

Clue 10 says the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. That's good to know.

Clue 5 says the person who had pizza lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fifth house.

Clue 2 says the person wearin' boots lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person wearin' boots lives in the second house, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house.

"I'm gonna try to figure this out. So, we got three houses, and three people, and they all like different kinds of books. One likes mystery books, one likes science fiction, and one likes history books. And they all got different devices: a computer, a television, and a phone.

Clue 1 says the mystery book reader lives next to the history book buff. Clue 2 says the mystery book reader lives in the first house. Clue 3 says the person with a computer lives to the right of the person with a phone. Clue 4 says the mystery book reader lives next to the person with a television.

Okay, so the mystery book reader is in the first house. And they live next to the history book buff, so the history book buff must be in the third house. Now, the person with a television lives next to the mystery book reader, so they must be in the second house.

Now, we gotta figure out who's got the computer and who's got the phone. Clue 3 says the person with a computer lives to the right of the person with a phone. So, if the person with a phone is in the first house, the person with a computer can't be in the second house, 'cause the person with a television is in the second house. So, the person with a phone must be in the first house, and the person with a computer must be in the third house.

Now, we got our houses filled in: 
- House 1: Phone (mystery book reader)
- House 2: Television
- House 3: Computer (history book buff)

But wait, the history book buff is in the third house, and they're supposed to be in the third house, but they're also supposed to be in the third house with the computer. So, the person with a computer must be in the third house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

Now, we gotta figure out who likes science fiction. We got mystery, history, and science fiction. The mystery book reader is in the first house, the history book buff is in the third house, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.

So, the answer is: **(C) 2**"
"I don't think so. People with St. Vitus's Dance, they got these weird movements they can't control. It's like their body's doin' its own thing. They can't really dance like normal people do, 'cause they can't control their movements. So, I don't think they'd be good at ballet competitions."
"Pig Latin is a funny way of talkin'. You take the first sound of a word and move it to the end and add ""ay"". So, if you say ""hello"", it becomes ""ellohay"". I reckon a pig could learn to do that. They're smart animals, after all. They can learn tricks and stuff. So, I'd say it's possible for a pig to use Pig Latin."
"I think Ringo Starr would probably have the pot roast at a restaurant. He's a Beatles guy, and they're from England, but they liked American food too."
"I don't think the 1936 Olympics stadium is big enough for a Super Bowl crowd. I mean, a Super Bowl is like, a huge football game, right? They got a lot of people goin' to it. The Olympics stadium, it's like, old and stuff. I don't think it could fit all them people."
"I think I know a little bit about fish. I've seen some pictures of fish and stuff. Brown rock fish, huh? I'm pretty sure I've seen some fish like that in the ocean. They're pretty common, I think. I've heard of Saint Kitts and Nevis, it's a place in the Caribbean, right? I'm pretty sure they got fish in the ocean there. So, I'd say... 

(B) Yes"
"Growin' seedless cucumbers can be a real pain for people who are scared of bugs. They're more prone to gettin' infested with aphids, whiteflies, and other tiny critters. You gotta check 'em every day to make sure they're not gettin' eaten alive. It's just too much stress for someone who's already freaked out by bugs."
"If Martin Luther posted one thesis a day, he wouldn't run out in half a year. There's 95 theses, and half a year is like, 6 months, right? That's not enough time for him to post all of 'em."
"Waltz is less injurious than slam dance. Waltz is like a slow dance, you know, you just kinda sway back and forth. It's pretty chill. Slam dance is like, super high-energy and people jump around a lot. That's just askin' for a hurt."
"A: (B) No

I don't think a 1943-S penny would be good for makin' silverware. I mean, it's a penny, and pennies are made of zinc, right? I don't know if you can make silverware outta zinc."
"I don't think you can snowboard on Venus. I mean, it's a really hot place, and it's got a lot of bad stuff in the air. It's not like the mountains where I go snowboarding. There's no snow on Venus, and it's just not a place you can go snowboarding."
"I don't think Charlemagne's dad was involved in the Battle of Tours. I think it was his granddad, Charles Martel, who fought in that battle."
"I think they do. Nissan is a Japanese company, and they use chopsticks in Japan."
"Hermes and Vulcan ain't the same god. Hermes is the Greek god, and he's all about messengers and stuff. He's got wings on his feet, and he's pretty cool. 

Vulcan, on the other hand, is the Roman god, and he's all about fire and blacksmiths. He's got a hammer, and he's like, super strong. They're two different gods, from different cultures, so they can't be the same."
"Ariana Grande, she's a singer, right? And she went through some stuff, like a bad thing happened at her concert. She talked about it, and she said she got PTSD. So yeah, she's a good example of someone who's been through that."
"I don't think Jack Black is gonna win no award against Bear McCreary. Jack Black is an actor, and Bear McCreary is a music guy. He does the scores for movies and TV shows. I don't think Jack Black does that."
"Cucumbers ain't all the same, ya know? I mean, I've had some that are super crunchy and some that are all squishy. Some are even kinda bitter, like the ones my grandma uses for pickles. And then there's the ones that are long and skinny, they're like the ones you find in the fancy stores. They're all different, I swear."
"I think Rick and Morty could be kinda bad for kids of alcoholics. I mean, the dad, Rick, he's always drinkin' and stuff, and it's not exactly a good example. He's also super mean to his family, and that's not healthy. I don't know, but I think it could be kinda triggering for some people."
"I don't think Simon Cowell can vote for the next Supreme Court judge. I mean, he's a TV guy, right? He's on that show where people sing and dance. He don't got nothin' to do with the government or nothin'."
"I don't think Jack Dempsey ever saw Conor McGregor fight. Jack Dempsey was a boxer a long time ago, like in the 1900s. Conor McGregor is a fighter too, but he's from way later, like in the 2000s. They're from different times, so it's unlikely Jack Dempsey would've seen him fight."
"I don't think Amy Winehouse was into Star Wars: Rogue One. I don't know much about her, but I don't think she was a fan of that movie."
"Euphoria is when you feel super happy or excited, like you're on top of the world. It's like a rush, you know? And yeah, some people get that feeling from doin' drugs. They like it so much they keep doin' it, even if it's bad for 'em. So, I guess the answer is:

(A) Yes"
"I don't think the Apollos could beat the D'Artagnans. I mean, the Apollos are like, mythological guys, right? They're all about poetry and music and stuff. They don't seem like they'd be very good at fightin'. And the D'Artagnans, they're like, sword fighters and adventurers. They're from a book, I think. They're pretty good with swords and all that.

So, I'd say the D'Artagnans would probably win in a fight against the Apollos. I mean, who's gonna win when you got a bunch of poets and musicians against a bunch of sword fighters? It's just not a fair fight.

So, my answer is: (A) No"
Sunscreen ain't gonna help with skin cancer. It's like puttin' a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. It's just a band-aid.
"I don't think the French Defence can stop a four-move checkmate. I mean, I've seen some chess games where people try to checkmate their opponents in just a few moves, and it's pretty hard to stop. The French Defence is a good opening, but it's not like it's foolproof or anything."
"I don't think it's a good idea to drink week-old chlorine water. Chlorine is like, a disinfectant, right? It's meant to kill germs and stuff. But if it's been sitting around for a week, I don't know if it's still good. I mean, I've heard that chlorine can be bad for you if you drink too much of it. It can make your stomach hurt and stuff.

I think it's better to be safe than sorry. If you're not sure if the water is safe to drink, it's best to get some fresh water from somewhere else. You know, like a bottle or a filter or something. That way you can be sure it's clean and safe to drink.

So, I'd say the answer is:

(B) No"
"I don't think a person with color blindness can tell the difference between chlorine gas and neon gas. They're both colorless, so it's not like they'd be able to see a difference in color."
"I think Elizabeth I of England could've seen the play Dido, Queen of Carthage. It was written by some fella named Christopher Marlowe, and it was around when she was still queen."
"You wanna know if you can avoid them internet trolls on Reddit?  Well, yeah, you can. Here's what you can do:

First, you can just ignore 'em. Like, if someone's bein' a jerk, you can just not look at their posts or comments no more. It's like, you know, they're not even there.

Or, you can block 'em. That's like, a button you can press, and they can't bother you no more.

If they're bein' super mean or breakin' the rules, you can report 'em. That's like, tellin' the mods, and they'll take care of it.

You can also hide their posts or comments. That way, you don't have to see 'em.

And, like, don't engage with 'em, 'kay? Don't respond or nothin'. That just makes it worse.

You can also use some special tools on your browser to block 'em or filter out their stuff.

And, if all else fails, just take a break from Reddit. It's like, a big ol' website, and you can just step away for a bit.

So, yeah, you can avoid internet trolls on Reddit."
"Sea turtles are doin' alright, I guess. They're just chillin' in the ocean, eatin' their seaweed and swimmin' around. They don't really care about all the stuff that's goin' on on land."
"I think Jesus would understand the Easter Bunny. I mean, it's a symbol of new life and stuff, right? Easter's about Jesus comin' back to life, and the bunny's got eggs and all that. It's like, a reminder of the whole thing."
"I think an elephant would definitely win in a fight against a macaque. I mean, just look at the size difference. Elephants are huge, like, massive. They're like the biggest land animals on Earth. Macaques are just little monkeys, right? They're like, tiny compared to an elephant. I don't think the macaque would stand a chance."
Augustus wasn't his real name. His real name was Gaius Octavius.
"I don't think the Confederacy spoke Old English before the Civil War. I mean, I've heard people talk about how they spoke English, but it was the kind of English we still speak today, not some old language from a long time ago. I've never heard of anyone talkin' about Old English bein' spoken in the South."
"Robert Wadlow, that's the fella who was super tall, right? He was like a giant. I mean, I've seen pictures of him and he's just huge. He's like a skyscraper compared to a dog. I got a friend who's got a German Shepherd, and that dog's not even as tall as my knee. So yeah, Robert Wadlow would definitely tower over a German Shepherd."
"Jack Kerouac, the writer guy, he didn't really benefit from drinkin' a lot. He had a lot of health problems, like back pain and stuff. I think the drinkin' made it worse."
"I think the most expensive color in the world is blue. I mean, I've heard that the pigment ultramarine blue is super hard to make and costs a lot of money. It's like, made from a special kind of rock or something. I'm not really sure, but I've heard it's really pricey."
"I don't think Ryan Crouser could throw a Bengal fox. I mean, it's a wild animal, and it's not like a heavy weight or a ball that you can just pick up and throw. It's got bones and fur and stuff, and it's gonna be hard to hold onto, let alone throw. Plus, it's not like it's gonna just sit there and let him throw it, it's gonna try to get away. So, I'd say the answer is:

(B) No"
"I think Lord Voldemort would've been barred from Hogwarts. I mean, he was a bad egg, always causin' trouble and hurtin' people. He even killed his own mom, which is just plain wrong. I reckon the teachers at Hogwarts wouldn't have put up with that sorta behavior."
"The Jackson 5 was a big family band. They had like, five brothers in the band. There was Michael, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon. They sang a lot of songs together and were super popular.

The Isley Brothers were a family band too, but they only had three brothers. They were still pretty famous, but I think the Jackson 5 was bigger. They had more brothers and they were on TV and stuff."
"You don't need lactobacillus to make pickles. You can just use vinegar and salt to soak 'em. Some people might use that lactobacillus stuff, but it's not necessary."
"I don't know much about this stuff, but I think the Wall Street Crash of 1929 hurt a lot of people's investments. I'm pretty sure it affected a lot of companies, including the ones that made robots. I mean, if people don't have money, they ain't gonna buy no robots, right? So yeah, I think it hurt the stocks of robotics companies."
"I don't know what Khanbaliq is, but I do know Moon Jae-in is a person from South Korea. He's the president, right? I think he was born in South Korea, not in some other country. So, I'd say... 

(A) No"
"People with anorexia nervosa are more likely to break a bone. This is because they don't eat enough food, and their bodies get weak. They don't have enough calcium and other stuff that helps keep their bones strong. It's like when you don't eat enough fruits and veggies, your body gets weak, right? Same thing with anorexia nervosa. Their bones get weak too, and they're more likely to break."
"Travelers on the Oregon Trail, they sang songs. They called 'em sea shanties, but I reckon that's a bit of a stretch. They were more like folk songs, hymns, and other kinds of tunes. They'd sing 'em to lift spirits, keep each other's company, and make the long journey a mite more bearable. So, the answer is:

 (A) Yes"
"Shootin' a bald eagle ain't gonna get you more time than Michael Vick. I mean, I don't know what Vick did, but I know he got 23 months for it. If you shoot a bald eagle, you might get a year in jail, that's it."
"I don't think Gandhi watched Bonanza. He lived a long time ago, and Bonanza was a TV show that came out way after he passed away."
"Hornets? They got nothin' to do with the ocean, right? I mean, they're bugs that live on land. But, I guess they do help pollinate plants and stuff. And some birds and other animals eat 'em. So, I guess they do have some kinda connection to the ocean, even if it's just through the food chain. So, I'd say... 

(B) Yes"
I don't know what Esperanza Base is.
"Grey seals and whales, like the big one in that book, they live in the ocean. They swim in the same waters, so yeah, they can swim together."

"I don't think people celebrate Earth Day with a ceremonial tire fire. I mean, that just don't sound right. We're supposed to be tryin' to take care of the Earth, not burnin' stuff."
Buddy the Elf knows a guy who works in publishing.
"Q: Could a hamster experience two leap years?

A: (B) Yes

I think a hamster could live for a pretty long time if it's well taken care of. Like, I've had hamsters as pets and they can live for years. If a hamster lives for 4 years or more, it's possible it could see a leap year and then another one. I mean, leap years happen every 4 years, right? So if a hamster lives for 5 years, it could see two leap years."
"I don't think Rahul Dravid is a cricket, the insect. He's a person who plays cricket, a sport."
"I don't think the 23rd amendment gave Puerto Ricans the right to vote for president. I mean, I don't know much about it, but I know it's not that simple."

(B) No"
I don't know who Jacques Duèze is.
"You can't hide a pet macaque under your desk. They're big and strong, and they need room to move around. They're like little monkeys, and they'd probably just knock the desk over or get hurt tryin' to squeeze under it."
"I don't think Justin Bieber is gonna be takin' over Mike Pence's job. I mean, Justin Bieber is a singer, right? He sings songs and stuff. I don't think he's got anythin' to do with politics."
"Yeah, I think people on YouTube get a lot of advice from others. Like, if they're watchin' an audiobook, someone will be like, ""Hey, you should read this other book"" or ""You should listen to this other narrator."" It's like, unsolicited advice, you know? They're just tellin' you what to do, and you're like, ""Uh, thanks, I guess."""
"I think lengths are measured in metres. I've seen it on the telly and in shops, they all use metres."
"I don't know much about this stuff, but I heard that Walt Disney, the guy who made Goofy, was a Catholic. And I think I read somewhere that he got in trouble with the church. Apparently, he didn't want to take a loyalty oath to the Pope, and that's a big no-no in the Catholic Church. So, I guess that's like, a pretty serious offense. 

So, I'm gonna go with... (A) Yes."
"There are some mental disorders that people can hide. Like, you might know someone who seems fine on the outside, but they're dealing with stuff on the inside. For example, some people with anxiety might be able to put on a happy face, but they're really struggling. Or, someone with depression might be able to pretend like everything's okay, but they're really hurting.

It's like, you can't always tell what's going on with someone just by looking at them. They might be hiding their feelings or their problems, and you wouldn't even know it. It's like they're wearing a mask, and you can't see what's really going on underneath.

So, to answer your question, I'd say:

(A) Yes"
"I think Paul Bunyan would be a bad choice for urban planner. He's a big fella, but he's also kinda known for causin' a ruckus. I mean, have you heard the stories about him makin' the Grand Canyon? He's like a giant, but not exactly the kinda guy you wanna trust with buildin' a city."
"You can find parsley in a lot of places in the grocery store. I've seen it in the produce section, and sometimes it's with the other herbs in the fridge. I've even seen it in the salad bar, and sometimes it's with the international foods. I think it's 'cause it's used in a lot of different kinds of food."
"I think you could fit a football field on Alcatraz Island. I mean, it's a pretty big island, right? I've seen pictures of it, and it's like, a lot of land. I'm pretty sure a football field would fit on it."
"I think kaffir lime would be good in a White Russian. It's a weird flavor, but it might work. I mean, it's citrusy, so it might cut through the richness of the cream and the vodka. I'd try it, but I'm not sure if it'd be good or not."
"I don't think a goblin shark could ride a bike even if it had limbs. They're fish, and they're meant to swim, not ride bikes. They don't have the right body for it. They're all slippy and don't have legs or hands to hold onto the bike. It's just not gonna work."
"Kurt Cobain was a famous musician, right? He was the lead singer of Nirvana. They were a pretty big deal back in the day. I mean, I don't really know much about music, but I know they were popular.

Anyway, after Kurt Cobain died, his music didn't just disappear. People still listen to it. In fact, it's still pretty popular today. I've seen people wearing Nirvana t-shirts and stuff. And there are still bands out there that sound like them.

I think it's because his music was different from what was out at the time. It was like a breath of fresh air or something. And it's still fresh today. People like it because it's real, you know? It's not all fancy and produced like some other music.

So, to answer your question, I'd say... 

(B) Yes"
"You wanna know if a spice grinder is useless for cheap cinnamon sticks? Nah, it's not useless. You can grind 'em up real good with a spice grinder. It's like a little machine that makes 'em all powdery and stuff. It's way easier than tryin' to crush 'em with a spoon or somethin'."
A slingshot ain't artillery. Artillery's them big guns that shoot far and do a lot of damage. A slingshot's just a little thing you use to shoot marbles or rocks. It's not the same thing at all.
"You can eat soup with yer hands, yeah. Like, if it's a thick soup, like a stew or a chili, you can just scoop it up with some bread or a spoon. Or if it's a thin soup, like a broth, you can just drink it straight from the bowl."
"Katy Perry don't make gospel music. She sings pop songs. I think most people like her for her pop music, not gospel."
"I don't think the Capricorn symbol is a chimera. I mean, I've seen the symbol before, it's a goat, right? It's like a picture of a goat's head or something. I don't know what a chimera is, but it's not a goat."
"I don't think so. I don't know who Dafne Keen is, but I don't think she's a singer. She's probably an actress or something."
"I think they'd be pretty good at a UPS job. Iris and Hermes are both super fast and good at deliverin' stuff. They're like messengers, you know? They'd be able to get packages from one place to another quick and on time. They're like the ultimate delivery team. So, I'd say they'd be great at UPS. 

(A) No
(B) Yes"
"Cookie Monster eats cookies, right? And cookies are made from flour and sugar and stuff. That's not healthy, I don't think. I mean, I like cookies too, but they're not good for you. So, I'd say Cookie Monster's diet is not Paleo friendly."
"I don't know much about this stuff, but I'll give it a shot. 

Pi is like, a number that's used for circles and stuff. It's like 3 point 1 4 1 5 and so on. The square root of 5 is like, 2 point 2 3 6. I think. 

So, if you compare the two, pi is bigger than the square root of 5. That means the answer is... 

(B) No"

"I don't think Alice from ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" could join a Masonic Lodge. I mean, she's just a kid, right? And I don't think they let kids in those places.

(A) No"
"I don't think a bull shark bite hurts worse than a crocodile bite. I mean, I've heard people say that sharks got strong jaws, but crocodiles are like, super strong too.

In some places, they might even stone 'em. That's right, stone 'em. It's like, a punishment from the olden days. So, if a cleric is not married and they're having sex, they might get stoned."
"The Riksdag is like a big group of people who make decisions for Sweden. They're like the government, but not the president or the king. They make laws and stuff. It's like a big meeting where they talk and vote on things. So, yeah, the Riksdag is a political entity. 

(B) Yes"
"You know, I think spaghetti should not be slick when it's cooked. I mean, if it's all slick, it's like it's too wet or somethin'. It's supposed to have a little bit of bite to it, like it's still got some texture. If it's all slick, it's just not right."

So, I'd say you're just as likely to die of hypothermia in either place, but probably not very likely at all."

"I don't think it's dark in Basel during the day. I mean, Basel is a city in Switzerland, right? And Switzerland is like, a normal place with normal daylight hours. It's not like it's always dark or anything. So, I'd say it's not dark in Basel during the day."

I don't know anyone who started a new religion in the Himalayas in the 19th century."

"Huh, I don't think handedness has anything to do with how you use American Sign Language. I mean, I've seen people sign with their left hand and their right hand, and it's all the same to me.

"You wanna know if you can swap out the pins in a bowling alley with Oscars?  I reckon you could, but it'd be kinda weird. I mean, the Oscars are them fancy gold statues, and the pins are just, well, pins. But, I guess if you had a bunch of Oscars and you wanted to use 'em for bowling, you could do it. Just don't expect it to be a real game of bowling, 'cause them Oscars are a lot heavier than regular pins."

Plus, they're little, so they can fit in some tight spaces on the board."

I've heard that Jesus was a real person who lived a long time ago, and his story is based on what people who knew him said about him. I don't think it's like the stories of Egyptian gods, which are just made-up myths. Jesus is a real person, and his story is about what he did and what he taught, not just some made-up story.

So, I think the answer is:

(A) No"
"Methuselah is a tree, right? It's super old, like, really old. I think it's over 4,800 years old. That's crazy. If it's still alive today, it would be the oldest living thing, I reckon. So, I'd say it would hold a record in the Common Era."

And some deaf people even make their own music, like with sign language or dance. They can still feel the rhythm and the emotions of the music, even if they can't hear it."
"Human footprints on Mount Sharp?  I think I've heard of that place.  It's a big mountain on Mars, right?  I'm pretty sure I've seen pictures of it.  And I'm pretty sure I've seen footprints on it too.  I mean, who else could've made 'em?  It's not like it's a natural thing, like a rock or something.  So, I'm gonna say...

I don't get why people make such a big deal about leap years. It's just an extra day, right? So if someone was born in '96, they'd be 4 years old in 2000, not 1. That's just basic math."
"I don't think Kobe is used in a BLT. I mean, I've never seen it in a BLT before. I think it's some kinda fancy beef, but I don't think it's what they put in a BLT."
"Clark Gable, he was a famous actor, right? He was married a few times, I think. I'm pretty sure he was married three times. 

Richard Burton, he was another famous actor, and I think he was married a lot more than Clark Gable. I'm pretty sure he was married five times."
"Frost in September in Texas? Nah, that's weird. I mean, it's still summer, right? I don't think I've ever seen that before. I reckon it's pretty rare. So, I'd say it's (B) Yes."
"Mickey Mouse is a cartoon character, ya know? He's not a real person, so he can't go buy stuff online or in stores. He's just a character in cartoons and movies. So, he's unlikely to make a purchase at Zazzle. 

The answer is (B) Yes."
"I think the animals in the Chinese calendar are animals, right? And animals are, like, living things. And living things are in the Chordata phylum, I think. That's like, a group of animals that have a notochord, which is like a backbone or something. So, yeah, the animals in the Chinese calendar are in the Chordata phylum.

So, the answer is: (A) Yes"
"I don't think a Halloween cruise in the Gulf of Mexico is a good idea. I mean, have you ever heard of hurricanes? They're like super strong storms that can ruin your whole trip. And they happen a lot in the Gulf of Mexico, especially around Halloween. I've seen it on the news before, people's cruises get cancelled 'cause of a hurricane. So, I'd say it's not a good idea to go on a cruise there around Halloween."
"I think Phileas Fogg's trip would be hard to do during that Pope's time. The Pope, John Paul I, only lasted a short time, like a month or somethin'. I reckon it'd be tough to go around the world in 80 days with all the changes in transportation and stuff back then."
"I don't know much about ŽRK Kumanovo, but I do know the Spice Girls. They're a famous girl group from England. They sing and dance, right? ŽRK Kumanovo sounds like a sports team. I think they play some kind of ball game. 

If the Spice Girls were to do a show or a performance, I reckon they could compete against ŽRK Kumanovo. Maybe they could sing a song or dance during a break in the game. That would be kinda cool. So, I'd say... 

(A) Yes"
"Raw carrots are better for gettin' vitamin A. They're like, super good for your eyesight and stuff. When you cook 'em, they lose some of that good stuff. My grandma always says to eat 'em raw, and she's always been right about these kinda things."
"You wanna know if you gotta be in eleventh grade to get a driver's license? Nah, I don't think so. I mean, I got my license when I was 16, and I was in tenth grade."
"Iggy Pop's real name is James Newell Osterberg. He got that name from his dad, James Newell Osterberg Sr. So, he wasn't named after his dad, Iggy."
"I think Cyndi Lauper would use milk substitute in her rice pudding. She's a vegan, ya know?"
"I don't think olive oil can kill rabies. I mean, I've heard of people using it for cooking and stuff, but I ain't never heard of it being used for nothin' like that. If you get bitten by a rabid animal, you gotta go see a doctor, not pour olive oil on the wound."
"Chinchillas, they're warm-blooded, ya know? They got them thick fur coats, so they stay warm even when it's cold outside. They're like us, they got a body temperature that stays the same no matter what the weather's like."
"I don't think Eskimos sunbathe a lot. They live in really cold places, like the Arctic, and they're always dressed in warm clothes. They're more worried about staying warm than getting a tan."
"I don't think onions can make a thermonuclear bomb. I mean, I've never heard of anyone tryin' to make a bomb out of onions. They're just a food, right? You can eat 'em, put 'em in a salad, or sauté 'em in a pan. They're not gonna blow up the world."
"I don't think the Communist Party would support that trickle-down thing. They're all about helping the people, not just the rich folks. They want everyone to be equal, and that doesn't sound like what trickle-down economics is all about. It sounds like it's just for the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer. So, I'd say the answer is:

(B) No"
"I don't think a kid in eleventh grade can be president. They're too young. You gotta be 35 years old to be president, right?"

"Christopher Columbus, he sailed to the New World, right? He was from Italy, but he went to Spain to get the money and the support to do it. So, he was sailin' for Spain, not Italy."
I don't think you need ropes to run a frigate. They're them big ships with engines and stuff. They don't use ropes like we do on a sailboat.
"I don't know much about libraries, but I think the Library of Alexandria would need less shelf space than the Library of Congress. I mean, the Library of Congress is like, super big and has a lot of stuff, right? I've heard it's got millions of books and things. The Library of Alexandria, I don't know, it's been destroyed and all, but I think it was smaller. So, I'd say (B) Yes."
"Paratroopers are good at mountain rescue. They're trained to jump outta planes and land in the middle of nowhere, so they must know how to survive in the wilderness. They're like superheroes, but with more gear and less fancy suits.

They can climb mountains, find food and water, and fix broken bones. They're like the Swiss Army knife of rescue teams. They can do it all."
"I don't think Quiet would be a good fit for teachin' at Haub. I mean, she's a sniper and a soldier, not a teacher. She's all about sneakin' around and shootin' people, not standin' up in front of a classroom and talkin' about books. I don't think she'd be very good at explainin' things to students, and she might even scare 'em with her whole silent-but-deadly vibe. So, I'd say (B) Yes, she'd be a poor choice for a lecturer."
"I don't think watermelons are grown in Antarctica. I mean, it's all ice and snow there. They don't have no soil or nothin' to grow stuff in. Brazil, on the other hand, is a warm place with lots of sunshine and water. They can grow all sorts of fruits and veggies there, including watermelons. So, I'd say watermelons are definitely grown more in Brazil than in Antarctica. 

The answer is (A) No."

"You're askin' if someone could use an armadillo as a shield?  Well, I reckon that's a pretty weird question, but I'll give it a shot. Yeah, I think you could use an armadillo as a shield. They got them hard shells on 'em, right? That's like, their defense mechanism or somethin'. So, if you were in a tight spot and you had an armadillo handy, you could probably use it to block somethin'. Just don't hurt the armadillo, that's just cruel."

And the Statue of Liberty is in America. I'm pretty sure the Statue of Unity is more level with the Statue of Liberty than that old lighthouse in Egypt. I mean, I've heard of the Lighthouse of Alexandria, but I don't know much about it. But I'm pretty sure the Statue of Unity is taller than the Statue of Liberty, so it must be more level with it than that old lighthouse.

So, my answer is: (B) Yes"
I don't think Moon Jae-in got that Abitur thing. I'm pretty sure he didn't.
"I don't think Tom Cruise can explain mental auditing. I mean, he's an actor, right? He's good at acting, but I don't think he's a doctor or a scientist or anything like that.

(A) Yes
(B) No"

Now, I ain't no math whiz, but I heard that the Tiger Stadium in Detroit could fit a whole lotta people. I'm talkin' thousands, maybe even tens of thousands.

Answer: (B) No"
"I think Oscar Wilde got a pretty bad deal. He got arrested and stuff for bein' gay, and it was all because of some old laws that said it was wrong.

"I don't think World of Warcraft is heavy at all. It's like, a video game, right? You play it on a computer or a console. It's not something you can hold in your hand or put on a scale. It's just a bunch of code and stuff. So, I'd say it's not heavy like a loaf of bread."
"Mongeese and rhinos, they're both old animals, but I think the rhinos came first. Rhinos have been around for a long time, and they're pretty big and strong. I'm pretty sure they existed before the mongooses."
"I don't think the Joker is in a healthy relationship. He's a crazy guy, always causin' trouble and hurtin' people. He's got a thing with that Harley Quinn chick, but it don't seem right. She's all about him, and he's just usin' her for his own gain. It's like he's playin' with her, and she's just goin' along with it. That don't seem like a healthy relationship to me.

(A) No
(B) Yes"

It sounds like a fella who works with that other guy, you know, the one who makes all the movies with the guys in them. I think his name is Marty, and he's friends with Robert De Niro. I'm pretty sure Jennifer Lawrence's middle name is the same as that guy's last name."

"I don't think SSRIs are as safe for teenagers and young adults as they are for adults. I mean, I've heard that some people who take those meds for depression can get really bad thoughts and even try to hurt themselves. It's like, the FDA put a warning on the labels or something, saying that it's not good for kids and young adults. I'm not a doctor or anything, but it seems like it's not worth the risk."
"I don't think Christians believe in Sheol after death. I mean, I've heard of it, but it's more of a Jewish thing, right? I think Christians believe in heaven and hell, and that's it. They don't really talk about some place called Sheol. So, I'd say the answer is:

 (B) No"
"I don't know much about music, but I think Lil Jon had a big hit with ""Get Low"". I'm pretty sure that was with the Ying Yang Twins. I don't think it was with The Lox, though.

(B) Yes"
"I don't think the United States Military Academy would reject someone with multiple sclerosis. I mean, they're not gonna turn someone away just 'cause they got a disease. They're gonna look at the person as a whole, right? They'll see if the person can handle the physical stuff they gotta do at the Academy.

I think they'll look at how bad the MS is and if the person's got it under control. If they're takin' meds and stuff, and they're doin' okay, I reckon they'd be fine. They'd probably just have to get a doctor's note or somethin' to say they're good to go.

So, I'd say the answer is (A) No. They wouldn't reject someone with multiple sclerosis."

"Strawberries can get worms. I mean, I've seen 'em. They're like little tiny things that live inside the strawberry. I don't know what they are, but they're like little worms.

They got sandwiches, muffins, and pastries too. It's like the same menu, just in a different place. So, I'd say it's a yes."
"I don't think General Zod would care about no phone. He's a super powerful alien, right? He's got way better tech than any phone. I mean, he's from Krypton, and they're way more advanced than us. He'd probably have his own fancy device that's way better than an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy S4. So, I'd say he'd choose neither of those. 

(B) No"
"I don't know how many people go through that 30th Street Station every day, but I do know Dorton Arena can hold a lot of people. It's like, 14,000 or something. I don't think all those people could fit in there, though."

"I don't know much about this stuff, but I'll try my best to answer. 

Paul the Apostle was a Christian guy who got beheaded by the Romans. I think that's a pretty violent way to die. Ahimsa is a word I've heard before, it's like, non-violence, right? So, if someone gets beheaded, that's kinda the opposite of non-violence. 

So, I'd say Paul's death did violate the tenets of Ahimsa."
"I don't think Muhammed was a member of the Uniting Church in Australia. I mean, Muhammed was a prophet and all that, and the Uniting Church is a Christian church. They're two different things, right? So, I'd say the answer is:

"I think an ocelot could outrun a kindergartner. I mean, ocelots are like, wild cats, right? They're fast and stuff. They're like little predators. And kindergartners are just little kids. They're fast too, but not as fast as a wild animal. I've seen videos of ocelots running, and they're like, super quick. I don't think a kindergartner could keep up with that."
"Nancy Pelosi, she's a Democrat, right? And Democrats are usually for women's rights, like, you know, the right to choose. So, I think she'd be against denouncin' abortion."

"I don't think the Holy Land belonged to Adamu's tribe. I mean, I don't know who Adamu is, but I think the Holy Land is a place in the Bible, and it's got a lot of history and stuff. I'm pretty sure it's not associated with some tribe called Adamu."

"If you eat too many oranges, you might get the runs. I mean, I love oranges, but my cousin's mom ate a whole bag of them one time and she was running to the bathroom all day. I think it's because oranges are kinda acidic and they can mess with your stomach. My friend's sister said it's because of the sugar, but I don't know about that. All I know is that eating too many oranges ain't good for you."
"I don't think Sara Paxton is Latino. I don't know much about her, but I know she's an American actress and model."

(A) No
(B) Yes"

"I don't think Don King killed nobody. He's a boxing promoter, you know? He's all about the fights and the money. I ain't heard nothin' about him hurtin' nobody. Charles Manson, on the other hand, was a bad dude. He was involved in some murders back in '69."

"I think Marvel's Gateway would be pretty jealous of the Doctor's TARDIS. I mean, the TARDIS can change its look to fit in with its surroundings, like a chameleon or something. It's like it's got a magic cloak or something. The Gateway, on the other hand, just makes portals to other places. It's like, yeah, it's cool and all, but the TARDIS is like, super sneaky and can hide in plain sight. So, yeah, I think the Gateway would be pretty envious of the TARDIS. 

(B) Yes"
"I don't think you can watch all of JAG in six months. I mean, there's a lot of episodes. I've seen some of 'em, and they're pretty long. I don't know how many there are, but it's a lot. You'd have to watch like, a whole bunch every day. I don't think that's possible."

"The Pantheon in Paris, it's called the Panthéon."
"I don't think a diamond can float on water. I mean, I've never seen one do it. Diamonds are heavy, right? They're like, super hard and stuff. Water's got some weight too, so I reckon a diamond would just sink."

(A) No"
"Harry Potter was way better for Warner Bros. I mean, it made a lot more money. They made a bunch of movies and they all did super good. I think the last one made over a billion dollars.

(B) No"

So, to answer your question: 

(B) Yes"
"I don't think the NY Stock Exchange closing bell would be heard at Universal Music Group's headquarters. They're in different places, right? The NYSE is in New York, and Universal Music Group is in California."
"I think The Jungle Book has some pretty racist stuff in it. I mean, the way Kipling talks about the Indian and African characters is kinda weird. He makes them out to be savage and uncivilized, and it's like, that's not really fair. And the way he portrays the bad guy, Shere Khan, is pretty racist too. He's a Muslim tiger, and Kipling makes him out to be this evil, evil guy just because of his religion. It's like, that's not right.

So, I think The Jungle Book does have some racist subtext. I mean, it's an old book and stuff, but that doesn't make it okay. It's still pretty messed up.

(B) Yes"

"I don't think Japanese serfdom was better than English serfdom. I mean, serfdom is just a fancy word for being a slave, right? You're stuck on a farm or land and you gotta do what the lord says. In Japan, I heard they had some freedom, but it's still not like you're free. You're still tied to the land and gotta give the lord some of your stuff.

In England, I think it was even worse. They had to work on the lord's land for free, like, a lot of the time. And they had to give them food and other stuff too. It's like, you're basically a slave. So, I think English serfdom was worse than Japanese serfdom. 

So, the answer is (A) No."

It's like, I don't know, maybe it's just a coincidence, but it's kinda weird.

So, I guess the answer is (B) Yes."

I'm pretty sure his daughter, Catherine of Austria, married Arthur, Prince of Wales. And Arthur was the brother of Henry VIII, the famous king of England. So, yeah, I think the answer is that the king of Portugal in 1515 had familial ties to the Tudors."

Answer: (B) No"

Martin Luther King Jr. was a preacher too, but he lived a lot later, in the 1900s. He was a civil rights leader and he fought for equality for black people in America. He's the one who gave that famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech.

So, they're two different people with the same name, but they did different things."

So, I'd say the answer is:

(A) No"

"Let's figure this out. Eve starts with Helga. Then Eve and Alice switch, so Eve is with Ophelia. Then Dave and Claire switch, but that don't change Eve's partner. Then Claire and Eve switch, so Eve is with Helga again. Then Bob and Alice switch, but that don't change Eve's partner. Then Bob and Dave switch, but that don't change Eve's partner either.

Claire was dancing with Sam before she switched with Alice. And before that, Eve was dancing with Claire, but that don't matter. What matters is who Claire was dancing with before that. Claire was dancing with Sam.

So, Dave is dancing with Bob, and Bob was dancing with Eve, and Eve was dancing with Claire, and Claire was dancing with Sam. That means Dave is dancing with Sam.

The answer is (C) Sam."

Finally, Dave and Eve swap gifts. Dave gets the blue present and Eve gets the purple present.

Now, let's see what Bob has. He got the purple present first, then the red present. So, at the end of the event, Bob has the red present."
"So, let's figure this out. There's five people: Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve. They all got a ball each. Alice got a brown ball, Bob got a green ball, Claire got a purple ball, Dave got a red ball, and Eve got a black ball.

Now, they start swappin' balls. First, Bob and Dave swap. So, Bob got the red ball and Dave got the green ball.

Next, Eve and Alice swap. Now Eve got the brown ball and Alice got the black ball.

Then, Bob and Dave swap again. But they already swapped, so they're goin' back to the same thing. Bob still got the red ball and Dave still got the green ball.

After that, Bob and Claire swap. Now Bob got the purple ball and Claire got the green ball.

Finally, Claire and Alice swap. Now Claire got the black ball and Alice got the purple ball.

So, let's see who got the red ball. It's Dave. He's the one with the red ball.

The answer is (A) red ball."
"So, let's figure this out. Claire starts with a red ball. Then, she swaps with Dave, so she gets the purple ball. Then, Dave swaps with Alice, but that don't matter 'cause Claire already got the purple ball. Then, Claire swaps with Bob, so she gets the brown ball. Then, Dave and Claire swap again, but Claire already had the purple ball, so she still has the brown ball. Then, Bob and Eve swap, but that don't change Claire's ball.

So, Claire has the brown ball. The answer is (A)."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, Claire and Bob swap gifts. Claire gets the pink ball, and Bob gets the black ball.

Then, Bob and Dave swap gifts. Now Bob has the orange ball, and Dave has the black ball.

Next, Eve and Claire swap gifts. Claire gets the brown present, and Eve gets the pink ball.

After that, Bob and Alice swap gifts. Now Bob has the red present, and Alice has the orange ball.

Finally, Dave and Claire swap gifts. Dave gets the brown present, and Claire gets the black ball.

So, Dave has the brown present. The answer is (A)."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, Claire and Eve switch partners. So Claire is now dancing with Jamie, and Eve is dancing with Sam.

Then, Dave and Alice switch partners. Now Dave is dancing with Alice, and Alice is dancing with Izzi.

Next, Claire and Dave switch partners. Claire is now dancing with Dave, and Dave is dancing with Jamie.

After that, Claire and Alice switch partners. Claire is now dancing with Alice, and Alice is dancing with Dave.

Finally, Bob and Eve switch partners. Now Bob is dancing with Eve, and Eve is dancing with Lola.

"So, let's figure this out. At the start, Alice is the goalkeeper, Bob is the striker, Claire is the cheerleader, Dave is the center midfielder, and Eve is the right midfielder.

First, Eve and Dave swap positions. Now Eve is the center midfielder, and Dave is the right midfielder.

Then, Dave and Bob swap. Now Dave is the striker, and Bob is the center midfielder.

Next, Dave and Claire swap. Now Dave is the cheerleader, and Claire is the center midfielder.

After that, Dave and Bob swap again. Now Dave is the center midfielder, and Bob is the striker.

Finally, Alice and Bob swap. Now Alice is the striker, and Bob is the goalkeeper.

So, at the end of the match, Alice is playing striker. The answer is (D)."
"So, let's figure this out. There's Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve. They're all playin' soccer, right? At first, Alice is playin' fullback, Bob's playin' right midfielder, Claire's cheerleader, Dave's right winger, and Eve's center midfielder.

Then, Claire and Eve switch places. So now, Alice is still fullback, Bob's still right midfielder, Claire's center midfielder, Dave's right winger, and Eve's cheerleader.

Next, Bob and Claire switch. Now, Alice is still fullback, Bob's center midfielder, Claire's right midfielder, Dave's right winger, and Eve's cheerleader.

Then, Bob and Dave switch. Now, Alice is still fullback, Bob's right winger, Claire's right midfielder, Dave's center midfielder, and Eve's cheerleader.

Then, Alice and Claire switch partners. Now Alice is with Claire, and Claire is with Dave (who was with Karl).

Next, Alice and Eve switch partners. Now Alice is with Eve, and Eve is with Claire (who was with Dave, who was with Karl).

After that, Bob and Dave switch partners. This don't change Alice's partner, so she's still with Eve.

Lastly, Dave and Claire switch partners. This don't change Alice's partner either, so she's still with Eve.

So, Eve was with Sam at the start, and she's still with Alice at the end. That means Alice is with Sam.

The answer is (A) Sam."

"So, let's figure this out. They all got a book at first. Then, Alice and Dave swapped. So, Alice got Ulysses, and Dave got The Pearl. Then, Dave and Claire swapped. Now Dave got Frankenstein, and Claire got Ulysses. Then, Alice and Bob swapped. So, Alice got The Great Gatsby, and Bob got Ulysses. Then, Dave and Claire swapped again. They already had Frankenstein, so that didn't change. Then, Eve and Alice swapped. Now Alice got Catch-22, and Eve got The Great Gatsby.

So, Alice has Catch-22. The answer is (E)."
"So, let's figure this out. There's five people: Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve. They all got a ball, and they trade 'em around. 

First, Bob and Claire swap. So now Bob's got the green ball, and Claire's got the brown ball.

Then Dave and Eve swap. Now Dave's got the red ball, and Eve's got the white ball.

Next, Alice and Eve swap. Now Alice's got the white ball, and Eve's got the blue ball.

After that, Dave and Claire swap. Now Dave's got the red ball, but then he swaps with Bob."
"So, let's figure this out. We got five people: Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve. They're all playin' soccer, and they start in different positions. 

Alice is playin' right midfielder, Bob's on the bench, Claire's the goalkeeper, Dave's the left winger, and Eve's the center midfielder.

Then, Eve and Alice swap positions. So now Eve's playin' right midfielder, and Alice is playin' center midfielder.

Next, Dave and Alice swap. Now Dave's playin' center midfielder, and Alice is playin' left winger.

Then, Alice and Eve swap again. So Eve's back to center midfielder, and Alice is back to right midfielder.

After that, Dave and Claire swap. Now Dave's the goalkeeper, and Claire's the center midfielder.

Finally, Bob and Claire swap. So Bob's the goalkeeper, and Claire's on the bench.

So, at the end of the match, Bob is playin' goalkeeper. That's option (E)."
"So, let's figure this out. Eve starts out as left midfielder. Then, she swaps with Alice, so she's now striker. Then, she swaps with Claire, but that don't matter 'cause she's already swapped once. Then, she swaps with Bob, so she's back to being striker. Then, Bob swaps with Dave, but that don't change Eve's position. Then, Eve swaps with Dave, and now she's right winger.

So, Eve is playin' right winger at the end of the match. The answer is (D)."
"So, let's figure this out. 

First, Alice and Claire swap positions. That means Alice is now playin' right winger, and Claire is playin' goalkeeper.

Then, Alice and Bob swap. Now Alice is playin' left midfielder, and Bob is playin' goalkeeper.

Next, Dave and Bob swap. Now Dave is playin' goalkeeper, and Bob is playin' striker.

After that, Bob and Eve swap. Now Bob is playin' center midfielder, and Eve is playin' striker.

Finally, Dave and Eve swap. Now Dave is playin' center midfielder, and Eve is playin' goalkeeper.

So, Alice is now playin' left midfielder."

Finally, Alice and Dave swap balls. Now Alice has Dave's ball, which is white, and Dave has Alice's ball, which is orange.

So, Eve has the pink ball."
"Let's figure this out. So, Dave starts with Melissa, then he switches with Bob, so now Dave is with Patrick. Then Claire and Dave switch, so Claire is with Patrick and Dave is with Ophelia. Now Eve and Alice switch, so Eve is with Jamie and Alice is with Rodrigo. Then Claire and Eve switch, so Claire is with Eve and Eve is with Patrick. Finally, Alice and Eve switch, so Alice is with Patrick and Eve is with Rodrigo. Now, let's see who Dave is with. He was with Ophelia after the second switch, and that didn't change. So, Dave is with Ophelia."
"So, let's figure this out. They started with Alice as striker, Bob as fullback, Claire as left midfielder, Dave as right midfielder, and Eve as benchwarmer. Then, Alice and Bob swapped positions. So now Alice is fullback and Bob is striker.

Next, Dave and Bob swapped. Now Dave is fullback and Bob is right midfielder.

Then, Alice and Eve swapped. Now Alice is benchwarmer and Eve is fullback.

After that, Dave and Claire swapped. Now Dave is left midfielder and Claire is fullback.

Finally, Alice and Eve swapped again. Now Alice is fullback and Eve is benchwarmer.

So, at the end of the match, Eve is playing benchwarmer.

The answer is (C) benchwarmer."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, Bob and Dave swap gifts. So now Bob has the brown present and Dave has the yellow present.

Then, Eve and Bob swap gifts. Now Eve has the yellow present and Bob has the orange present.

Next, Bob and Dave swap gifts again. But they already swapped gifts, so they're back to the same thing: Bob has the brown present and Dave has the yellow present.

After that, Eve and Alice swap gifts. Now Alice has the orange present and Eve has the pink ball.

Finally, Claire and Eve swap gifts. Now Eve has the green present and Claire has the orange present. But we don't care about Eve, we care about Alice. And Alice has the orange present.

So, the answer is (C)."
"Let's figure this out.

"So, let's figure this out. They started with Alice as striker, Bob as fullback, Claire as left winger, Dave as center midfielder, and Eve as benchwarmer. Then, Claire and Bob swapped, so Claire is now fullback and Bob is left winger. Next, Dave and Claire swapped, so Claire is now center midfielder and Dave is fullback. Then, Alice and Bob swapped, so Alice is now left winger and Bob is striker. After that, Eve and Dave swapped, so Eve is now center midfielder and Dave is benchwarmer. Finally, Alice and Dave swapped, so Alice is now center midfielder and Dave is left winger.

Finally, Claire and Alice swap balls again. Claire gets Alice's pink ball, and Alice gets Claire's blue ball. But we want to know what Claire has, not Alice. So, Claire has the blue ball.

The answer is (A) blue ball."
"So, let's figure this out. We got 7 people on the team: Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude. They all start with different positions. Eve is the goalkeeper, Bob is the cheerleader, Claire is the right winger, Dave is the fullback, Fred is the center midfielder, Alice is the left midfielder, and Gertrude is the benchwarmer.

Then, Eve and Fred swap positions. Eve becomes the center midfielder, and Fred becomes the goalkeeper. Next, Bob and Claire swap positions.

Finally, Eve and Alice swap books. Eve gets The Odyssey, and Alice gets Lolita.

Now, let's see what Dave has. Dave started with Catch-22, then got The Great Gatsby, then got Ulysses, then got The Great Gatsby, then got Ulysses, and finally got The Great Gatsby. So, Dave has The Great Gatsby.

The correct answer is (G) The Great Gatsby."

"Let's figure this out. 

First, we gotta know who's dancing with who at the start. We got Alice with Lola, Bob with Melissa, Claire with Helga, Dave with Karl, Eve with Sam, Fred with Izzi, and Gertrude with Patrick.

Now, let's see what happens. Alice and Eve switch partners. That means Alice is now dancing with Sam, and Eve is dancing with Lola.

Next, Dave and Fred switch partners. That means Dave is now dancing with Izzi, and Fred is dancing with Karl.

Then, Eve and Claire switch partners. That means Eve is now dancing with Helga, and Claire is dancing with Sam.

"Let's figure this out. 

First, Dave and Alice swap balls. So Dave has Alice's ball, which is pink, and Alice has Dave's ball, which is green.

Then, Alice and Fred swap balls. Now Alice has Fred's ball, which is black, and Fred has Alice's ball, which is green.

Next, Fred and Dave swap balls. Now Fred has Dave's ball, which is pink, and Dave has Fred's ball, which is green.

Fred got The Fellowship of the Ring, and Claire got Catch-22. Then, Claire and Alice swapped. Claire got The Odyssey, and Alice got Catch-22. Then, Bob and Dave swapped again. This trade didn't change anything, 'cause Bob already had The Pearl. Then, Eve and Fred swapped. Eve got The Fellowship of the Ring, and Fred got The Great Gatsby.

Now, let's see what Gertrude has. She started with Moby Dick, but then she swapped with Bob and got Hound of the Baskervilles. There ain't no more trades for Gertrude, so she still has Hound of the Baskervilles.

The answer is (G)."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, Eve and Fred swap gifts. Eve has a black ball, and Fred has a pink ball.

Next, Alice and Bob trade positions. Now Alice is cheerleader and Bob is striker.

Then, Fred and Alice trade positions. So now Alice is center midfielder and Fred is cheerleader.

After that, Gertrude and Dave trade positions. Now Dave is right winger and Gertrude is benchwarmer.

Then, Alice and Eve trade positions again. Now Alice is striker and Eve is center midfielder.

Next, Claire and Bob trade positions. Now Bob is fullback and Claire is cheerleader.

Finally, Fred and Alice trade positions one more time. Now Alice is cheerleader and Fred is striker.

So, at the end of the match, Bob is playin' fullback."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, Eve and Fred swap books. Eve gets Moby Dick, and Fred gets Frankenstein. 

Then, Claire and Bob swap books. Claire gets The Fellowship of the Ring, and Bob gets The Great Gatsby.

Now, Eve and Fred swap books again. Eve gets Moby Dick back, and Fred gets Frankenstein back.

Next, Gertrude and Alice swap books. Gertrude gets Lolita, and Alice gets Ulysses.

After that, Gertrude and Eve swap books. Gertrude gets Frankenstein, and Eve gets Ulysses.

Finally, Dave and Fred swap books. Dave gets Moby Dick back, and Fred gets Hound of the Baskervilles.

So, Alice has Ulysses."
"So, let's figure this out. We got a bunch of people playin' soccer, and they all start in different positions. Then they start swappin' places. 

First, the goalkeeper and the fullback swap. That means the person who was keepin' the ball out of the goal is now playin' defense, and the person who was defendin' is now keepin' the ball out of the goal.

Next, the fullback and the striker swap. Now the person who was defendin' is tryin' to score, and the person who was tryin' to score is now defendin'.

Then, the goalkeeper and the right winger swap. Now the person who was keepin' the ball out of the goal is playin' on the right side, and the person who was on the right side is now keepin' the ball out of the goal.

After that, the cheerleader and the goalkeeper swap. Now the person who was cheerin' is keepin' the ball out of the goal, and the person who was keepin' the ball out of the goal is now cheerin'.

Next, the left winger and the fullback swap. Now the person who was on the left side is defendin', and the person who was defendin' is now on the left side.

Then, the fullback and the right midfielder swap. Now the person who was defendin' is playin' in the middle, and the person who was in the middle is now defendin'.

Finally, the right winger and the left winger swap. Now the person who was on the right side is on the left side, and the person who was on the left side is now on the right side.

So, after all that swappin', the person who was the goalkeeper at the start is now... the cheerleader."
"So, let's figure this out. We got Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude. They're all playin' soccer, right? At first, Alice is playin' left midfielder, Bob is cheerleader, Claire is right winger, Dave is right midfielder, Eve is striker, Fred is left winger, and Gertrude is fullback.

Then, Fred and Gertrude switch places. Now, Gertrude is left winger and Fred is fullback.

Next, Dave and Gertrude switch. Now, Gertrude is right midfielder and Dave is fullback.

Then, Gertrude and Fred switch again. Now, Gertrude is fullback and Fred is right midfielder.

After that, Alice and Bob switch. Now, Alice is cheerleader and Bob is left midfielder.

Then, Claire and Dave switch. Now, Claire is fullback and Dave is right winger.

Next, Eve and Claire switch. Now, Eve is right winger and Claire is striker.

Finally, Alice and Gertrude switch. Now, Alice is fullback and Gertrude is left midfielder.

So, at the end of the game, Alice is playin' fullback. That's option (B)."
"Let's figure this out. They all got new books at first. Then they started swappin' 'em around. 

First, Fred and Eve swapped. Fred got Hound of the Baskervilles, and Eve got Catch-22. 

Then Gertrude and Alice swapped. Gertrude got Moby Dick, and Alice got Frankenstein.

Next, Dave and Claire swapped. Dave got Ulysses, and Claire got The Fellowship of the Ring.

After that, Alice and Bob swapped. Alice got Lolita, and Bob got Frankenstein.

Then Alice and Fred swapped again. Alice got Hound of the Baskervilles, and Fred got Lolita.

Then Eve and Dave swapped. Eve got Ulysses, and Dave got Catch-22.

Finally, Eve and Alice swapped. Eve got Frankenstein, and Alice got Catch-22.

So, let's see who Fred has. He had Hound of the Baskervilles after the first swap. Then he got Lolita after the second swap. And he didn't swap again after that. So, Fred has Lolita.

The answer is (C)."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, Bob and Eve swap gifts. So Bob gets Eve's red present, and Eve gets Bob's white present.

Then, Claire and Gertrude swap gifts. This don't change what Bob's got.

Then, Alice and Claire switch partners. Now Alice is dancing with Sam, and Claire is dancing with Helga.

Finally, Eve and Gertrude switch partners. Now Eve is dancing with Izzi, and Gertrude is dancing with Helga.

So, Alice is dancing with Sam. The answer is (E) Sam."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, Claire and Bob swap books. Claire gets The Pearl, and Bob gets Lolita. 

Then, Alice and Claire swap books. Claire gets Catch-22, and Alice gets Lolita.

Now, let's see who has what. Claire has Catch-22, Alice has Lolita, Dave has Moby Dick, Eve has The Fellowship of the Ring, Fred has Hound of the Baskervilles, and Bob has The Pearl. Gertrude had The Odyssey, but I don't see any trades involving her after that. So, Gertrude still has The Odyssey.

The answer is (B) The Odyssey."

"Let's figure this out. We got a bunch of dancers, and they keep switchin' partners. We gotta follow it step by step.

First, Dave and Bob switch partners. That means Dave is now with Sam, and Bob is with Dave's old partner, which is Rodrigo.

Next, Claire and Bob switch partners. Now, Claire is with Bob, and Bob is with Izzi.

Then, Eve and Bob switch partners. Now, Eve is with Bob, and Bob is with Karl.

"Let's figure this out. 

First, Claire and Bob swap gifts. Claire has the blue present, and Bob has the brown present.

Then, Fred and Bob swap gifts. Fred has the brown present, and Bob has the black ball.

Next, Dave and Claire swap gifts. Claire has the black ball, and Dave has the blue present.

The answer is (B)."
"Let's figure this out. We got 7 people: Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude. They're all dancing with different people. At the start, Alice is with Karl, Bob is with Sam, Claire is with Jamie, Dave is with Ophelia, Eve is with Helga, Fred is with Izzi, and Gertrude is with Rodrigo.

First, Bob and Claire switch partners. So now Bob is with Jamie and Claire is with Sam.

Next, Fred and Alice switch partners. Now Fred is with Karl and Alice is with Izzi.

Then, Bob and Dave switch partners. So Bob is with Ophelia and Dave is with Jamie.

After that, Alice and Bob switch partners. Now Alice is with Ophelia and Bob is with Izzi.

"So, let's figure this out. We got 7 people on a soccer team: Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude. They all start in different positions. 

First, Dave and Eve swap places. So, Dave is now on the left, and Eve is on the fullback. Then, Eve and Alice swap. Now Alice is on the left, and Eve is on the right. Next, Claire and Gertrude swap. Claire is now the striker, and Gertrude is the center midfielder. Then, Fred and Dave swap. Now Fred is on the left, and Dave is the cheerleader. After that, Bob and Dave swap. So, Bob is the fullback, and Dave is the right winger. Then, Claire and Dave swap again. Claire is now the fullback, and Dave is the striker. Finally, Gertrude and Claire swap. Now Gertrude is the center midfielder, and Claire is the striker.

So, let's see where Alice is now. She started on the right, then moved to the left, and stayed there. The answer is (A) left winger."
"So, let's figure this out. We got these people, Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude. They're all playin' soccer, and they got different positions. 

First, Gertrude and Claire switch places. Gertrude was playin' left midfielder, and Claire was playin' fullback. Now they're switched.

Then, Alice and Eve switch. Alice was sittin' on the bench, and Eve was playin' striker. Now they're switched.

Next, Claire and Bob switch. Claire was playin' fullback again, and Bob was cheerleader. Now they're switched.

After that, Eve and Dave switch. Eve was playin' striker again, and Dave was goalkeeper. Now they're switched.

Next, Dave and Gertrude switch. Dave was playin' striker, and Gertrude was playin' goalkeeper. Now they're switched.

Finally, Fred and Eve switch. Fred was playin' right midfielder, and Eve was playin' goalkeeper. Now they're switched.

So, after all that switchin', let's see where Bob is. He was playin' cheerleader at the start, but he switched with Claire a few times. Claire switched with Gertrude, and then Claire switched with Bob. So, Bob ended up switchin' with Claire, and Claire was playin' fullback. That means Bob is playin' fullback.

The answer is (E) fullback."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, Alice and Fred swap balls. So, Fred has the green ball now. Then, Gertrude and Fred swap balls. Now, Fred has the brown ball. Next, Bob and Dave swap balls. This don't change what Fred has.

This don't change what Fred has. Finally, Alice and Eve swap balls. This don't change what Fred has.

So, Fred has the black ball."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, we gotta know who's dancing with who at the start. We got Alice with Patrick, Bob with Ophelia, Claire with Lola, Dave with Rodrigo, Eve with Jamie, Fred with Sam, and Gertrude with Karl.

Now, let's see what happens. Claire and Fred switch partners. That means Claire is now dancing with Sam, and Fred is dancing with Lola.

"Let's figure this out. So, we got these people, Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude. They all got a book at the start. Alice got Hound of the Baskervilles, Bob got Lolita, Claire got The Great Gatsby, Dave got The Odyssey, Eve got Ulysses, Fred got The Pearl, and Gertrude got Frankenstein.
