"Let's figure out where the person with a vase of tulips lives.

We know there are four houses, and each house has a different person. Each person has a different flower in their foyer: carnations, daffodils, tulips, and lilies. They also play different musical instruments: guitar, piano, percussion, and flute.

The flutist lives in the second house. This means the person in the first house can't play the flute.

The person with tulips lives next to the guitarist. This means the guitarist can't be in the first house because the person with tulips has to be next to them.

The person with lilies lives next to the person with carnations. This means the person with lilies can't be in the first house because the person with carnations has to be next to them.

The person with the piano lives two houses away from the flutist. This means the person with the piano lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's think about the houses. The person with the piano lives in the fourth house. The person with the flute lives in the second house. This means the person with the piano lives two houses away from the person with the flute. The person with the flute can't be in the first house, so the person with the piano must be in the fourth house.

The person with the flute lives in the second house. The person with the piano lives in the fourth house. This means the person with the flute lives two houses away from the person with the piano.

From clue 6, we know the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must live in the second and third houses.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have 5 houses with people in them. Each person likes a different drink and ate a different food for lunch. We need to find out who lives in the fifth house.

From clue 1, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. So, the answer is (A) 5."
"Let's figure out where the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a different person. The people in these houses like different sports, eat different fruits, and have different flowers in their foyer.

Clue 1: The soccer player lives to the left of the person eating oranges.

Clue 2: The swimmer and the person with a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other.

Clue 3: The person with a vase of tulips lives to the right of the person eating mangos.

Clue 4: The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person eating oranges.

Let's think about this. If the person eating oranges lives in house 1, the swimmer and the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 2 and house 3. But then the person with a vase of tulips can't live to the right of the person eating mangos.

So, the person eating oranges must live in house 2. The swimmer and the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 1 and house 3. The person eating mangos must live in house 3, and the person with a vase of tulips must live in house 1.

But wait, the soccer player lives to the left of the person eating oranges. So, the soccer player must live in house 1, and the person with a vase of tulips must live in house 3.

No, that can't be right. The person with a vase of tulips lives to the right of the person eating mangos. So, the person eating mangos must live in house 1, and the person with a vase of tulips must live in house 3.

But then the soccer player can't live to the left of the person eating oranges.

Let's try again. If the person eating oranges lives in house 2, the person eating mangos must live in house 1. The person with a vase of tulips lives to the right of the person eating mangos, so they must live in house 3.

The soccer player lives to the left of the person eating oranges, so they must live in house 1.

The swimmer and the person with a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person eating oranges. So, the swimmer must live in house 1, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 2.

No, that can't be right. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person eating oranges, so they must live in house 3.

The correct order is: house 1 - soccer player, house 2 - person eating oranges, house 3 - person with a bouquet of daffodils.

The correct answer is (B)."
"Let's figure out where the person with a vase of tulips lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a different person. The people in these houses like different things: one likes science fiction books, one likes mystery books, and one likes history books. They also eat different foods: one had pizza, one had fried rice, and one had spaghetti. Each person has a different device: one has a radio, one has a TV, and one has a phone. And they like different flowers: one has carnations, one has tulips, and one has daffodils.

We know the violinist lives in the first house. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the percussionist. So, the violinist is in the first house, the percussionist is in the second house, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house.

The person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone live next to each other. The person with a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, so the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone must be in the second and third houses.

The history book buff lives to the right of the person with a vase of tulips. This means the person with a vase of tulips is in the second house, and the history book buff is in the third house.

The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the percussionist. The percussionist is in the second house, so the person who ate fried rice is in the third house.

There is one house between the person with a radio and the history book buff. The history book buff is in the third house, so the person with a radio is in the first house.

The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house. The person who ate fried rice is in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti is in the first house.

The mystery book reader lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. The violinist is in the first house, so the mystery book reader is in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house.

The person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone live next to each other. The person with a vase of tulips is in the second house, so the person with a phone is in the second house too.

Clue 8: The person who plays the cello does not live in the third house.

Let's start with Clue 2. We know the person who likes mystery books lives in the second house.

Now, let's look at Clue 4. The person who likes history books lives next to the person with lilies. This means the person with lilies cannot live in the first house, because the person who likes history books would have to live in the first house, and there's no room for the person with lilies. So, the person with lilies must live in the third house.

Now, let's look at Clue 5. The person who plays the drums lives next to the person with a computer. This means the person with a computer must live in the first house, because the person who plays the drums would have to live in the second house.

Now, let's look at Clue 7. The person with a gameboy lives next to the person with roses. This means the person with roses must live in the second house, because the person with a gameboy would have to live in the first house.

Now, let's look at Clue 8. The person who plays the cello does not live in the third house. This means the person who plays the cello must live in the first house.

Now, let's put it all together. The person with a computer lives in the first house, the person with roses lives in the second house, and the person with lilies lives in the third house.

The person with a gameboy lives next to the person with roses, so the person with a gameboy must live in the first house.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have two houses next to each other. One person lives in each house. We know some things about them:

- One person wears sandals and the other wears boots.
- One person likes mystery books and the other likes history books.
- One person drives a convertible and the other drives a truck.

We have some clues to help us solve this puzzle.

Clue 1: The person who drives a convertible lives next to the person who likes history books.

Clue 2: The person who wears boots does not live in the first house.

Let's think about this. If the person who likes history books lives in the second house, then the person who drives a convertible must live in the first house because they live next to each other. But if the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, then the person who wears boots can't live in the first house because the person who wears boots does not live in the first house.

So, the person who likes history books must live in the first house. And the person who drives a convertible must live in the second house because they live next to the person who likes history books.

Now, we know the person who wears boots can't live in the first house, so they must live in the second house. But we also know the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house, so the person who wears boots can't live in the second house.

This means the person who wears boots must live in the first house. And the person who wears sandals must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (B)."
"Let's figure out where the basketball player lives.

We know there's a golfer in the first house. 

The swimmer lives next to the person who likes romance books. This means the swimmer can't be in the first house because the golfer is already there. So, the swimmer must be in the second or third house.

The person who likes mystery books lives next to the person who likes history books. This means they can't be in the first house because the golfer is already there. So, the person who likes mystery books must be in the second or third house.

The swimmer can't be in the third house because the person who likes mystery books has to be next to the person who likes history books. This means the swimmer must be in the second house, and the person who likes mystery books must be in the third house.

Now we have: 
- Golfer in the first house
- ? in the second house (swimmer)
- ? in the third house (mystery book reader)
- ? in the fourth house (romance book lover)

The person who likes history books must be in the fourth house because the person who likes mystery books is in the third house.

Now we have: 
- Golfer in the first house
- Swimmer in the second house
- Mystery book reader in the third house
- History book buff in the fourth house

The basketball player can't be in the fourth house because the person who likes history books is there. The basketball player can't be in the first house because the golfer is there. So, the basketball player must be in the second or third house. But the swimmer is in the second house, so the basketball player must be in the third house.

The final answer is (A) 3."

Now, let's think about the order of the houses. If the person wearing sandals lives next to the person who likes romance books, and there are only 4 houses, the person wearing sandals must live in the first house, and the person who likes romance books must live in the second house.

The person wearing high heels can't live in the second house (clue 1), so they must live in the fourth house.

The person wearing loafers can't live in the first or second house, so they must live in the first house or the third house. But the person who likes mystery books lives in the third house (clue 3), so the person wearing loafers must live in the first house.

The person who likes history books lives to the right of the person wearing loafers (clue 2). Since the person wearing loafers lives in the first house, the person who likes history books must live in the fourth house.

So, the order of the houses is:
- House 1: person wearing loafers, person who likes history books
- House 2: person who likes romance books, person wearing sandals
- House 3: person who likes mystery books
- House 4: person wearing high heels

The person who likes mystery books lives in the third house, so the answer is:

(B) 3"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know there are three houses with people in them. Each person has a different device: a phone, a computer, or a gameboy. And each person likes a different color: yellow, blue, or green.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.

From clue 2, we know the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.

So, the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house, and the person who has a computer lives in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who likes yellow must live in the third house.

The person who has a phone must live in the second house, as it is the only remaining option.

So, the order of the houses from left to right is: green, phone, yellow, gameboy, computer. However, this is not possible as the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.

"Let's figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

We know there are four houses, and each house has a person with a favorite color, drink, and book. We also have some clues to help us solve the mystery.

From clue 5, we know the person who loves root beer lives in the third house. But clue 7 says the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the person who likes red and loves root beer is the same person.

From clue 8, we know the person who loves romance books lives next to the person who loves history books. Since the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who loves romance books and the person who loves history books must live in the first and second houses.

But clue 4 says the person who loves romance books doesn't live in the first house. This means the person who loves history books lives in the first house, and the person who loves romance books lives in the second house.

From clue 9, we know the person who loves tea doesn't live in the second house. Since the person who loves history books lives in the first house, the person who loves tea must live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the person who loves coffee lives two houses to the right of the person who likes green. But we already know the person who likes green can't live in the first house. This means the person who likes green must live in the fourth house, and the person who loves coffee lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know there are two houses between the person who likes white and the person who loves coffee. Since the person who loves coffee lives in the third house, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

From clue 6, we know the person who loves mystery books doesn't live in the fourth house. Since the person who likes green lives in the fourth house, the person who loves mystery books must live in the second house.

Now we have the following information:
- House 1: History book buff (likes white)
- House 2: Romance book lover (mystery book reader)
- House 3: Root beer lover (likes red)
- House 4: Tea drinker (likes green)

The coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The answer is (D)."
"Let's figure out where the cat lover lives.

We know there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The person in the first house likes a different book than the person in the second house. One person likes mystery books and the other likes fantasy books. We know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.

The person in the first house also has a different favorite color than the person in the second house. One person likes green and the other likes yellow. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house, the person in the second house must like green.

The person in the first house also has a different pet than the person in the second house. One person likes cats and the other likes fish. We know the fish enthusiast does not live in the first house, so the person in the first house must like cats.

The person in the first house also ate something different for lunch than the person in the second house. One person had pizza and the other had spaghetti. Since the person in the first house does not have pizza, the person in the second house must have had pizza.

So, the person in the first house likes cats, has a fantasy book, likes yellow, and had spaghetti. The person in the second house likes green, has a radio, likes fantasy books, and had pizza. But we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house, so the person in the second house must like mystery books.

The person in the second house also has a radio, but we already know the person in the first house has a radio. This means the person in the second house must have a phone.

So, the person in the first house is a cat lover, and the answer is:

(A) 1"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

From clue 4, the dog owner lives in the second house.

From clue 14, the dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the dog owner is in the second house, the person who likes red must be in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who had stew does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in the first house.

From clue 17, the tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white cannot be in the first house (because the person who had stew is in the first house), the person who likes white must be in the fourth house, and the tea drinker must be in the third house.

From clue 12, the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes red is in the third house, the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza must be in the fourth and fifth houses, respectively.

From clue 13, there are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives. Since the person who had pizza is in the fifth house, the person who owns horses must be in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who owns horses is in the first house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From clue 2, the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in the first house (because the person who owns horses is in the first house), the person who likes blue must be in the fifth house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house.

From clue 9, the root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes blue is in the fifth house, the romance book lover must be in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is occupied by the person who likes milk. Therefore, the person who likes milk and the romance book lover must be in the third and fourth houses, respectively, and the person who likes blue must be in the fifth house is incorrect. The person who likes blue is in the fifth house, the person who likes milk is in the fourth house, and the romance book lover is in the third house.

From clue 8, the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who likes milk is in the fourth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fifth house.

From clue 5, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is occupied by the person who likes milk. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house is incorrect. The person who ate spaghetti is in the fifth house is incorrect.

"Let's figure out where the fish enthusiast lives.

We know there are four houses with different people. Each person has a different pet and a different type of flower in their house.

The cat lover lives in the first house. 

The person with tulips lives to the left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the dog owner must be in the second house. This means the person with tulips is in the first house, but that can't be true because the cat lover is in the first house. So, the person with tulips must be in the second house, and the cat lover is in the first house.

The person with daffodils doesn't live in the second house. The dog owner is in the second house, so the person with daffodils must live in either the first or the fourth house. But the cat lover is in the first house, so the person with daffodils must live in the fourth house.

There is one house between the person who owns horses and the person with carnations. Since the person with daffodils is in the fourth house, the person with carnations must be in the fourth house too. But we already said the person with daffodils is in the fourth house, so the person with carnations must be in the third house.

The person with lilies lives to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the person with carnations is in the third house, the person with lilies must be in the third house, but we already said that. So, the person with lilies must be in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Person with tulips
- House 3: Person with lilies
- House 4: Person with carnations and daffodils

The only person left is the fish enthusiast. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the fish enthusiast must be in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know there are two houses next to each other. One person lives in each house. Each person has different shoes, pets, and devices.

Clue 1: The person with a phone lives in the first house.

Clue 2: The person wearing boots does not live in the second house.

Clue 3: The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other.

Since the person with a phone lives in the first house, let's start with that. We know the person in the first house has a phone.

Now, let's think about the person wearing boots. Clue 2 says they don't live in the second house. So, they must live in the first house. But wait, we already know the person in the first house has a phone. So, the person in the first house can't be wearing boots.

This means the person in the first house must be wearing high heels.

The person in the second house must be wearing boots, and they must own horses and have a radio because they live next to the person in the first house.

So, the person wearing high heels lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve the puzzle.

We have three houses with people in them. Each person has different shoes, favorite colors, favorite fruits, lunch, and devices.

From clue 1, we know that the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other.

From clue 2, we know that the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know that the person who is eating apples does not live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know that the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots.

From clue 5, we know that there is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives.

From clue 6, we know that the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house.

From clue 7, we know that the person who had pizza does not live in the second house.

From clue 8, we know that the person who is eating mangos lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.

From clue 9, we know that the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live next to each other.

From clue 10, we know that the person who has a computer lives to the left of the person who has a phone.

Let's start by combining clues 1 and 9. Since the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live next to each other, and the person who has a computer lives to the left of the person who has a phone, we can conclude that the order of the houses is: computer, loafers, phone.

From clue 1, we know that the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other. Since the person who has a computer is in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

From clue 2, we know that the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. This is already satisfied.

From clue 3, we know that the person who is eating apples does not live in the first house. Since the person who has a computer is in the first house, the person who is eating apples must be in the second house.

However, this contradicts clue 1, which states that the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other. This means that our previous conclusion was incorrect.

Let's try again. From clue 1, we know that the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other. 

From clue 2, we know that the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know that the person who is eating apples does not live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know that the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots.

From clue 5, we know that there is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives.

From clue 6, we know that the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house.

From clue 7, we know that the person who had pizza does not live in the second house.

From clue 3, we know that the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the fish enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 10, we know that the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

From clue 9, we know that the person who had stew lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 2, we know that the cat lover lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know that the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.

Now, let's put the information together:

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the fish enthusiast, so the fish enthusiast lives in the second house.
- The person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who had stew, so the person who had stew lives in the fourth house, the person who ate fried rice lives in the fifth house, and the person who has a computer lives in the third house.

Now, we know the person who has a computer lives in the third house, but the cat lover lives in the third house. This means the person who has a computer is not the cat lover. The cat lover lives in the third house, so the person who has a computer lives in the second house is not possible because the fish enthusiast lives in the second house. The person who has a computer lives in the third house is not possible because the cat lover lives in the third house. The only option left is the person who has a computer lives in the fourth house is not possible because the person who had stew lives in the fourth house.

The person who had pizza does not live in the third house, so the person who had pizza lives in the second house or the fourth house. The person who has a computer lives in the third house, so the person who had pizza lives in the second house or the fourth house.

"Let's figure out where the person with a television lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a different person. Each person plays a different instrument, wears different shoes, eats different fruit, and has a different device.

From clue 1, we know the pianist doesn't live in the first house. 

From clue 3, we know the person wearing high heels and the pianist live next to each other. This means they can't be in the first house, because the pianist can't be there. So, they must be in the second or third house.

From clue 5, we know the person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person wearing boots. This means the person eating kiwis must be in the first house.

From clue 7, we know the person eating oranges lives to the left of the person with a television. This means the person with a television can't be in the first house, because the person eating oranges would be in the second house, and the person eating kiwis is already in the first house. So, the person with a television must be in the third house.

From clue 6, we know the person with a radio lives to the left of the person wearing high heels. This means the person with a radio must be in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live next to each other. This means they can't be in the first house, because the person with a radio is already there. So, they must be in the second or third house.

From clue 3, we know the person wearing high heels and the pianist live next to each other. Since the person with a radio is in the first house, the person wearing high heels must be in the second house. This means the pianist is also in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person eating oranges lives to the right of the person eating kiwis. This means the person eating oranges must be in the second house.

Now we know the order of the houses: 1, 2, 3. We also know the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the person eating oranges is in the second house, and the person with a television is in the third house.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's figure out where the person who owns a sedan lives.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes milk lives in the third house, the person who is eating a banana must live in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the person who only drinks water must live in the first house.

From clue 13, we know the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow cannot live in the first house (because the person who only drinks water lives there), the person who owns a sedan must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Let's figure out who lives in which house.

We know there are three houses, and each person has a different car and eats a different fruit. The person in the first house eats kiwis.

The person in the first house can't drive a truck because the person who drives a truck doesn't live in the first house. The person in the first house also can't eat a banana because the person who eats a banana doesn't live in the second house.

So, the person in the first house eats kiwis and drives a convertible.

The person in the second house can't eat kiwis because the person in the first house eats kiwis. The person in the second house also can't drive a truck because the person who drives a truck doesn't live in the first house. And the person in the second house can't eat a banana because the person who eats a banana doesn't live in the second house.

So, the person in the second house eats mangos.

The person in the third house can't eat kiwis because the person in the first house eats kiwis. The person in the third house can't eat mangos because the person in the second house eats mangos. The person in the third house can't drive a convertible because the person in the first house drives a convertible. And the person in the third house can't drive an SUV because the person who owns an SUV doesn't live in the third house.

So, the person in the third house eats a banana and drives a truck.

The person in the second house can't drive a convertible because the person in the first house drives a convertible. The person in the second house can't drive a truck because the person in the third house drives a truck. So, the person in the second house must drive an SUV.

The correct answer is (B)."
"Let's figure this out.

We have three houses with people living in them. Each person ate something different for lunch: spaghetti, stew, and fried rice. They also play different sports: swimming, cricket, and tennis.

2. The person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who ate fried rice.
3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
4. The person who plays cricket doesn't live in the third house.

Let's think about it. If the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, then the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house because they live next to each other.

Now, we know the swimmer lives in the first house. The person who plays cricket can't live in the third house, so they must live in either the first or the second house. But the swimmer is already in the first house, so the cricket player must live in the second house.

So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

The answer is: **(B)**"

We know there are 5 houses with people wearing different shoes and driving different cars. The people are wearing sandals, running shoes, loafers, boots, and high heels. They are driving a minivan, SUV, truck, convertible, and sedan.

From clue 1, we know the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

The cricketer lives in the first house. 

The person who owns horses lives to the left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the person who owns horses can't be in the first house because the cricketer is already there. So, the person who owns horses must be in the second house, and the person who owns a sedan must be in the third house.

Now, let's think about the cat lover. The cat lover lives to the right of the person who owns a sedan. Since the person who owns a sedan is in the third house, the cat lover must be in the third house too.

But wait, we said the cat lover lives to the right of the person who owns a sedan, and the cat lover is also in the third house. This means the person who owns a sedan must be in the second house, and the person who owns horses must be in the first house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Horse owner
- House 2: Sedan owner
- House 3: Cat lover

The person who drives a truck lives to the right of the basketball player. This means the basketball player can't be in the third house because the cat lover is there.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know there are 4 houses, and each house has a different person. We also know that one person drives a minivan, and that person lives in the fourth house.

From clue 8, we know the basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means the person who drives a truck can't live in the first house because there's no one to the left of them. So, the person who drives a truck must live in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a person who likes a different drink: water, coffee, and tea. We also know each person has a different kind of car: a convertible, a sedan, and a minivan. And each person likes a different kind of book: fantasy, science fiction, and history. Lastly, each person is eating a different kind of fruit: apples, oranges, and mangos.

From the clues, we know the person who likes tea lives in the first house.

The person who likes apples lives to the left of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person who likes tea is in the first house, the person who likes apples must be in the first house too. This means the person who drives a minivan is in the third house.

The person who drives a convertible lives to the right of the person who likes science fiction. But if the person who drives a minivan is in the third house, the person who drives a convertible can't be in the third house. So, the person who drives a convertible must be in the second house.

Now, we know there's one house between the person who likes fantasy and the person who likes coffee. Since the person who drives a convertible is in the second house, the person who likes fantasy must be in the first house, and the person who likes coffee must be in the second house.

The person who likes oranges can't live in the second house. Since the person who likes apples is in the first house, the person who likes oranges must be in the third house.

So, the order is:
- House 1: Tea, Fantasy, Apples
- House 2: Coffee, ?, Mangos
- House 3: Minivan, Science fiction, Oranges

The person who likes science fiction is in the third house, and the person who likes mangos is in the second house. This means the person who likes coffee is in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

From Clue 3, we know the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the person who likes mystery lives in the third house, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person who likes fantasy does not live in the first house. Since the person who likes white lives in the first house, the person who likes fantasy must live in either the second or third house.

"Let's figure out where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

We know there are four houses, and each person likes a different kind of book, eats a different kind of fruit, and wears different shoes.

From clue 7, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.

From clue 8, we know the person who eats a banana lives to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the person who eats a banana lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, we know the person who eats apples doesn't live in the third house. Since the person who eats a banana lives in the fourth house, the person who eats apples must live in the first or second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who wears running shoes lives directly left of the person who eats apples. So, the person who wears running shoes must live in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the person who eats mangos lives directly left of the person who wears sandals. Since the person who wears running shoes lives in the first house, the person who eats mangos must live in the second house, and the person who wears sandals must live in the third house.

From clue 6, we know there's one house between where the person who eats apples lives and where the person who wears boots lives. Since the person who eats apples lives in the first or second house, and the person who wears boots can't live in the first house, the person who eats apples must live in the second house, and the person who wears boots must live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fourth house.

"Let's figure out where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

We know that one person ate fried rice and the other person ate spaghetti. We also know that one person owns a sedan and the other person owns an SUV.

We also know that the person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house. This means the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

Now, let's think about the person who likes white. We know that the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the person who likes white lives in the first house.

If the person who likes white lives in the first house, then the person who is wearing loafers must also live in the first house. This means the person who owns an SUV and the person who is wearing loafers both live in the first house.

The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. We know the person who owns a sedan lives in the second house, but we don't know who ate spaghetti yet.

The person who is wearing sandals must live in the second house because the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house, and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. The person who is wearing sandals must be the person who ate spaghetti.

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The answer is (B)."

We know the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other. This means they can't be in the first house because the person who only drinks water can't be in the first house (clue 3).

The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house because they live to the left of the person who eats mangos (clue 2). The person who eats apples lives to the left of the violinist (clue 9), and the person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who eats apples (clue 8).

The person who eats apples lives in the second house, and the violinist lives to the right of the person who eats apples (clue 9). So, the violinist lives in the third house.

"Let's figure this out.

We have two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The person in the left house is number 1, and the person in the right house is number 2.

We know two things:

1. The person with lilies doesn't live in the left house.
2. The person with a television lives in the left house.

So, the person with a television lives in the left house, which is number 1. And the person with lilies lives in the right house, which is number 2.

Now, we know the person in the left house has a television, and the person in the right house has lilies. That means the person in the left house must have a computer, because the other person has lilies.

So, the person with a computer lives in the left house, which is number 1.

The answer is: **(B)**"
"Let's figure out where the percussionist lives.

We know there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The people in these houses like different things.

One person had pizza and one had spaghetti. One person likes tulips and one likes daffodils. One person likes history books and one likes science fiction books. One person plays baseball and one plays golf. One person plays the guitar and one plays the drums (percussion).

We know the person who likes science fiction books lives to the left of the person who plays golf. This means the person who plays golf is in the house on the right.

We also know the person who had pizza and the person who likes history books live next to each other. Since the person who plays golf is in the house on the right, the person who had pizza and the person who likes history books must be in the house on the left.

The person who likes daffodils lives to the right of the person who plays the guitar. This means the person who plays the guitar is in the house on the left.

Now we have some information:
- House on the left: Person who had pizza, likes history books, and plays the guitar
- House on the right: Person who had spaghetti, likes daffodils, and plays golf

The only thing left is the person who plays the drums (percussion). Since the person in the house on the right had spaghetti and the person in the house on the left had pizza, the person in the house on the right must be the percussionist.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure out where the percussionist lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each house has a different person. The people in these houses have different pets, play different musical instruments, and have different devices.

From clue 1, we know the person who has a gameboy lives to the right of the guitarist. This means the guitarist can't be in the last house.

"Let's figure out where the violinist lives.

We know that one person has a bouquet of lilies and lives in the first house. This is a good clue to start with.

We also know that the person who has a radio lives to the right of the person who eats apples. And the person who has a radio also lives to the right of the violinist.

The basketball player lives in the second house. This means the person who eats apples can't live in the second house because the basketball player lives there.

So, the person who eats apples must live in the first house. But we already know the person with lilies lives in the first house. This means the person who eats apples can't live in the first house.

This means the person who eats apples lives in the second house. And the person who has a radio lives to the right of the person who eats apples, so the person who has a radio lives in the third house. But there is no third house, so this can't be right.

Let's think about it again. If the person who eats apples lives in the second house, then the person who has a radio lives to the right of the person who eats apples. This means the person who has a radio lives in the second house. But we already know the basketball player lives in the second house.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There are two people living in these houses. Each person ate something different for lunch, has a favorite color, favorite drink, and likes a different sport. They also wear different shoes.

From the clues, we know:

1. The person wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.

Let's start with Clue 2. If the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, then the person who likes white must live in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house.

Now, let's look at Clue 3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, the baseball player must also live in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know the person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, the person who only drinks water must also live in the second house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person who likes white lives in the first house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.
- The baseball player lives in the second house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.

Since the person who likes white lives in the first house, the person who likes red must live in the second house. The person who likes red cannot be the baseball player, as the baseball player lives in the second house. The person who likes red must be the person who ate stew, as the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person who likes white lives in the first house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.
- The baseball player lives in the second house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- The person who ate stew lives in the first house.

From the remaining information, we know the person who wears loafers must live in the first house, as the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

So, the person who wears loafers lives in the first house. The answer is:

(B) 1"
"Let's figure out where the person who loves root beer lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a different person. Each person eats a different kind of fruit: grapes, oranges, and mangos. And each person drinks a different drink: coffee, root beer, and water.

From the clues, we know:

1. The person who drinks coffee lives to the left of the person who eats mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who loves root beer.
3. The person who loves root beer does not live in the second house.
4. The person who eats oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's think about it. If the person who loves root beer lives in the first house, the person who drinks water must live in the third house. But then the person who drinks water lives to the right of the person who loves root beer, which is correct. So, the person who loves root beer must live in the first house.

Now, let's think about the other two houses. The person who eats oranges can't live in the second house, so they must live in either the first or the third house. But if they lived in the first house, the person who drinks coffee would have to live in the third house, and the person who eats mangos would have to live in the second house. But then the person who drinks coffee wouldn't live to the left of the person who eats mangos, which is not correct.

So, the person who eats oranges must live in the third house. The person who drinks coffee must live in the second house, and the person who eats mangos must live in the first house. But we already know the person who loves root beer lives in the first house, so that can't be right.

Wait, let's think about it again. If the person who eats oranges lives in the third house, the person who drinks water must live in the second house. And the person who drinks coffee must live in the first house. But then the person who drinks coffee wouldn't live to the left of the person who eats mangos, which is not correct.

So, the person who eats oranges lives in the third house, the person who drinks water lives in the second house, and the person who drinks coffee lives in the first house. But we already know the person who loves root beer lives in the first house, so that can't be right.

Let's think about it one more time. If the person who eats oranges lives in the third house, the person who drinks water must live in the second house. And the person who drinks coffee must live in the first house. But then the person who drinks coffee would live to the left of the person who eats mangos, which is correct.

"Let's figure out where the person who is wearing loafers lives.

We know that there are three houses, and each person ate something different for lunch: spaghetti, pizza, and fried rice. We also know that each person is wearing different shoes: loafers, running shoes, and boots.

From the clues, we know that the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. That's clue 3.

Now, let's look at clue 2. It says that the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. This means that the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, because if the person who is wearing boots lived in the third house, the person who ate fried rice would be to the right of the person who is wearing boots, not to the left.

So, we have the following arrangement so far:
- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Fried Rice

Now, let's look at clue 1. It says that the person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house. We already know that the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, so this clue is already true.

Now, let's look at clue 4. It says that the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. We know that the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, so the person who is wearing loafers must live in either the second or the third house.

But we already know that the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. This means that the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

From clue 9"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have two houses next to each other. One person lives in each house. They all have different things: one eats grapes, one eats mangos, one drives a convertible, one drives a minivan, one plays cricket, and one plays baseball.

We know the following clues:

1. The person eating grapes does not live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

From clue 2 and 3, we know the person in the second house is a baseball player and drives a convertible.

Now, let's think about the first clue. It says the person eating grapes does not live in the first house. This means the person eating grapes must live in the second house. But wait, we already know the person in the second house is a baseball player and drives a convertible. So, the person eating grapes cannot live in the second house.

This means the person eating grapes must live in the first house.

Now, let's think about the person in the second house. We know they are a baseball player and drive a convertible. The only thing left is that they must eat mangos.

So, the person eating mangos lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes white lives.

We know there are three houses with people in them. Each person is eating a different kind of fruit: apples, kiwis, and oranges. And each person likes a different color: blue, white, and green.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes blue lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis. This means the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house, the person who is eating apples must live in the first house, and the person who is eating oranges must live in the second house.

So, the order is: 1 (apples), 2 (oranges), 3 (kiwis).

Now, let's think about the colors. We know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. The person who likes white must live to the right of the person who likes green. This means the person who likes green must live in the first house, and the person who likes white must live in the third house.

So, the person who likes white lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's figure out where the person with a rose bouquet lives.

We know that the person who likes root beer lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet. This means the person with a rose bouquet can't live in the house on the right (house 2).

We also know that the soccer player lives next to the person who likes mystery books. This means the soccer player can't live in the house on the right (house 2) either.

And we know that the person with a gameboy lives to the left of the person who likes mystery books. This means the person with a gameboy can't live in the house on the right (house 2) either.

So, the person with a rose bouquet must live in the house on the left (house 1)."
"Let's figure out where the dog owner lives.

We know there are four houses, and each house has a different pet and a different car. The pets are: cat, fish, horses, and dog. The cars are: sedan, SUV, minivan, and truck.

From clue 1, we know the person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. This means the fish enthusiast can't be in the last house.

From clue 3, we know the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the truck and sedan can't be in the last two houses.

From clue 4, we know the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner. This means the fish enthusiast and dog owner can't be in the first and last houses.

From clue 5, we know the cat lover doesn't live in the second house.

Let's try to put the people in order. We know the truck and sedan are next to each other, and the fish enthusiast and dog owner are next to each other. The cat lover can't be in the second house, so the cat lover must be in the first or last house.

If the cat lover is in the first house, the truck and sedan can't be in the first and second houses because the fish enthusiast and dog owner are next to each other. So, the cat lover can't be in the first house.

If the cat lover is in the last house, the fish enthusiast and dog owner can't be in the last two houses. This means the fish enthusiast and dog owner must be in the first and second houses. But the cat lover can't be in the second house, so the cat lover must be in the first house.

Now we have the cat lover in the first house. The truck and sedan are next to each other, and the fish enthusiast and dog owner are next to each other. The fish enthusiast lives to the left of the dog owner, so the order is: cat lover, fish enthusiast, dog owner, truck and sedan.

But we know the person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. This means the minivan must be in the last house. The truck and sedan can't be in the last two houses, so the truck must be in the first house and the sedan must be in the second house.

The order is: truck, sedan, fish enthusiast, dog owner, minivan. The dog owner lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes blue lives.

We know there are four houses, and each person has a favorite color and a favorite drink. We also have some clues to help us solve the puzzle.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes blue can't be in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. This is a big clue!

From clue 2, we know the person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who only drinks water must be in the first house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

But wait, we already know the person who likes root beer lives in the second house! This means our previous conclusion is wrong. The person who likes white can't be in the second house.

Let's try again. From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in the second house. From clue 4, we know the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who only drinks water must be in the first house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house is incorrect.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. From clue 2, we know the person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk. This means the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

The correct order is: 
1. The person who only drinks water
2. The person who likes root beer
3. The person who likes yellow
4. The person who likes blue

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house, so the correct answer is:

(B) 4"
"Let's figure out where the bird keeper lives.

We know that the person who likes blue lives in the second house. This is from clue 6.

From clue 2, we know that the baseball player lives to the left of the cat lover. So, the baseball player must live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know that the person who eats grapes lives to the right of the basketball player. Since the baseball player lives in the first house, the basketball player must live in the second house. But we already know that the person who likes blue lives in the second house, so the basketball player must live in the first house, and the person who eats grapes lives in the third house.

From clue 7, we know that the person who wears loafers lives to the right of the person who eats grapes. So, the person who wears loafers lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know that the person who wears sandals lives to the right of the dog owner. Since the person who wears loafers lives in the third house, the dog owner must live in the first house. But we already know that the baseball player lives in the first house, so the dog owner must live in the second house, and the person who wears sandals lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know that the dog owner lives to the left of the person who likes green. Since the dog owner lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the third house. But we already know that the person who likes blue lives in the second house, so the person who likes green must live in the third house, and the person who likes blue must live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know that the cricketer lives to the right of the person who eats oranges. Since the person who eats grapes lives in the third house, the person who eats oranges must live in the first house. But we already know that the dog owner lives in the second house, so the person who eats oranges must live in the first house, and the cricketer lives in the third house.

From the remaining options, the person who eats mangos must live in the second house. The only option left is the bird keeper, so the bird keeper must live in the second house.

The answer is (C)."
"Let's solve the puzzle.

From clue 2, the person who owns horses lives in the first house.

From clue 11, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer lives in the fourth house, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house.

From clue 1, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the fifth house.

From clue 14, the tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper lives in the fifth house, the tennis player lives in the fourth house.

From clue 13, the cricketer lives in the fourth house. This means the tennis player cannot live in the fourth house. However, we already know the tennis player lives in the fourth house. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the information.

From clue 2, the person who owns horses lives in the first house. From clue 8, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. Since the guitarist cannot live in the fifth house (from clue 7), the guitarist lives in the second, third, or fourth house.

Therefore, the cricketer lives in the fourth house.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The people in these houses have different things: one plays a guitar and one plays a cello, one has a computer and one has a gameboy, and one has a dog and one has a fish.

We know that the person who plays the cello lives next to the person who has a gameboy. This means the cello player can't be on the right because then the gameboy player would be on the left, and they would be next to each other, but the cello player would be on the left of the gameboy player. So, the cello player must be on the left.

Now, we know the cello player is on the left, so the gameboy player must be on the right.

We also know that the person who has a dog doesn't live in the first house. Since the cello player lives in the first house, the dog owner must live in the second house.

So, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who owns an SUV lives.

We know there are four houses, and each person has a different kind of car and a different device. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.

The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.

The person who has a phone lives next to the person who owns an SUV. This means the person who owns an SUV can't live in the first house because the person who drives a minivan lives there. The person who owns an SUV also can't live in the third house because the person who has a gameboy lives there.

So, the person who owns an SUV must live in either the second or the fourth house.

The person who has a radio lives to the right of the person who has a gameboy. This means the person who has a radio lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's think about the person who has a phone. They live next to the person who owns an SUV. If the person who owns an SUV lives in the second house, the person who has a phone would live in the first house. But we already know the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house, so the person who has a phone can't live in the first house.

This means the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house, and the person who has a phone lives in the second house.

The person who has a computer can't live in the first house because the person who drives a minivan lives there. The person who has a computer can't live in the third house because the person who has a gameboy lives there. The person who has a computer can't live in the second house because the person who has a phone lives there. So, the person who has a computer must live in the fourth house.

But we already know the person who has a radio lives in the fourth house. This means the person who has a computer can't live in the fourth house.

So, the person who has a computer must live in the second house is incorrect, and the person who has a computer must live in the first house is also incorrect.

"Let's figure out where the person with a carnations arrangement lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each house has a different person with a different flower and a different device.

From clue 3, we know the person with a vase of tulips lives in the third house.

From clue 6, we know the person with a computer lives in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement.

From clue 2, we know the person with a phone lives directly left of the person with a television.

From clue 1, we know the person with a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person with a phone.

From clue 4, we know the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person with a radio.

From clue 5, we know the person with a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the person with a computer in the second house and the person with a vase of tulips in the third house.

Now, we have the following arrangement: 
2 - Computer
3 - Tulips
?

Since the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement, and the person with a vase of tulips lives in the third house, the person with a rose bouquet must live in the first house, and the person with a carnations arrangement must live in the fourth house.

Now, we have the following arrangement: 
1 - Rose
2 - Computer
3 - Tulips
4 - Carnations
?

From clue 2, we know the person with a phone lives directly left of the person with a television. Since the person with a computer lives in the second house, the person with a phone must live in the first house, and the person with a television must live in the fifth house.

Now, we have the following arrangement: 
1 - Phone
2 - Computer
3 - Tulips
4 - Carnations
5 - Television

From clue 1, we know the person with a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person with a phone. Since the person with a phone lives in the first house, the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in the fifth house.

Now, we have the following arrangement: 
1 - Phone
2 - Computer
3 - Tulips
4 - Carnations
5 - Lilies

From clue 4, we know the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person with a radio. Since the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fifth house, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in the fifth house, which is a contradiction. However, we can place the person with a bouquet of daffodils in the fifth house is not possible, so the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in the fourth house is not possible.

"Let's figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

We know that there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The person on the left is in house 1, and the person on the right is in house 2.

We also know that the person who has a radio lives next to the person who drives a truck. And the person who has a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.

So, the person who has a radio must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

Now, let's think about the other clues:

- The person who has a radio lives in the first house.
- The person who has a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.
- This means the person who had pizza must live in the second house.

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 2. The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know there are 4 houses with different people living in them. Each person ate something different for lunch: grilled cheese, spaghetti, pizza, and fried rice. Each person likes a different color: red, yellow, white, and green. Each person drinks something different: coffee, tea, water, and milk.

From Clue 1, the person who drinks tea lives in the first house.

From Clue 5, the person who drinks tea lives directly to the left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who had pizza lives in the second house, the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

From Clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. Since the person who likes milk lives in the third house, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must live in the third and fourth houses, or vice versa.

However, from Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house is not possible because the person who had pizza lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house is not possible because the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live in the third and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the fourth house as the only option for the person who ate spaghetti is not possible because the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live in the third and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the second house as the only option for the person who ate spaghetti is not possible because the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

"Let's figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a different person. The people in these houses like different sports, eat different foods, and have different flowers.

Clue 1: The golfer lives next to the basketball player, and they are on the left and right sides of the golfer.

Clue 2: The person with lilies lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese, and they are on the left side of the person who ate grilled cheese.

Clue 3: The soccer player lives in the third house.

Clue 4: The person who ate grilled cheese lives next to the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate grilled cheese is on the left side.

Clue 5: The person with tulips does not live in the third house.

Let's start with Clue 3. The soccer player lives in the third house. 

Now, let's think about Clue 1. The golfer lives next to the basketball player. They can't live in the third house because the soccer player lives there. So, the golfer and basketball player must live in the first and second houses.

Now, let's think about Clue 2. The person with lilies lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the golfer and basketball player live in the first and second houses, the person with lilies must live in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

Clue 4 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

Clue 5 says the person with tulips does not live in the third house. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person with tulips must live in the first house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person with lilies lives in the first house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
- The golfer and basketball player live in the first and second houses, but we don't know which is which.

Clue 1 says the golfer lives next to the basketball player. Since the person with lilies lives in the first house, the golfer must live in the first house, and the basketball player must live in the second house.

The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.

The answer is (B)."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know there are 5 houses with people in them. Each person ate something different for lunch: spaghetti, fried rice, pizza, stew, and grilled cheese. Each person likes a different color: green, white, blue, yellow, and red. And each person plays a different instrument: pianist, saxophonist, percussionist, violinist, and cellist.

From clue 3, we know the pianist lives in the third house.

"Let's figure this out.

We have two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who likes science fiction books. 

Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2 from left to right, the person who likes science fiction books must live in the left house, which is house 1."
"Let's figure out where the dog owner lives.

We know there are two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The person in the left house plays the piano, and the person in the right house plays the violin.

We also know that the person who likes root beer lives to the right of the person who owns horses. This means the person who owns horses lives in the left house, and the person who likes root beer lives in the right house.

But we also know that the person who likes white doesn't live in the right house. This means the person who likes white lives in the left house.

Now, let's think about the pets. We know the person in the left house owns horses, and the person in the right house likes root beer. We also know that the person in the right house plays the violin. 

The only person left is the dog owner, and the only house left is the left house. So, the dog owner lives in the left house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure out where the percussionist lives.

We know that the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. That's clue number 7.

We also know that the person who had stew lives in the second house. That's clue number 2.

Now, let's think about the person who ate fried rice. Clue number 5 says there are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives. This means the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

The guitarist lives to the left of the violinist. Clue number 3 says that. And clue number 4 says the violinist doesn't live in the fourth house. So, the guitarist and violinist must live in the first and second houses, in that order.

Now, let's think about the science fiction book fanatic. Clue number 1 says the percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. And we know the person who had stew lives in the second house. So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house.

But, if the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house, and the guitarist and violinist live in the first and second houses, then the percussionist can't live to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. This is a problem!

Wait, let's think about it again. Clue number 1 says the percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. And we know the person who had stew lives in the second house. This means the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house, and the percussionist must live in the second house.

The final order is:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (fried rice)
- House 2: Percussionist (stew)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (guitar)
- House 4: History book buff (pizza)

The percussionist lives in the second house. The correct answer is (A)."
"Let's figure out who lives in each house.

We know the person who likes white lives in the first house. This is from Clue 1.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other. Since the person who likes white lives in the first house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the second house.

Clue 7 says the person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, the person who owns horses must also live in the second house.

Now, let's think about the person who owns horses. Clue 6 says the dog owner lives to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the dog owner must live in the third house.

Clue 8 says the person who wears sandals lives to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the third house.

Clue 2 says the person who wears boots does not live in the second house. Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the person who wears boots must live in the first house.

Now, let's think about the person who likes green. Clue 5 says the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who wears running shoes. Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the first house. But we already know the person who wears boots lives in the first house. So, the person who likes green must be wearing boots.

Clue 3 says the bird keeper does not live in the third house. Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the bird keeper must live in the first house. But we already know the person who wears boots lives in the first house, and the person who likes green must be wearing boots. So, the person who likes green and the person who wears boots must be the same person.

Now, let's think about the person who has a vase of tulips. We already know the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house. Clue 8 says the person who wears sandals lives to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips. So, the person who wears sandals must live in the second house.

Now, let's think about the person who has a bouquet of lilies. We know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, and the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house. So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the first house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The person who likes white lives in the first house.
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
- The person who owns horses lives in the second house.
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house.
- The person who wears sandals lives in the second house.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
- The person who wears boots lives in the first house.

- The person who is a bird keeper lives in the first house.
- The person who owns horses lives in the second house.
- The person who owns horses lives in the second house.
- The person who owns horses lives in the second house.

The person who owns horses lives in the second house.

The answer is (B)."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have three houses with people living in them. Each person is eating a different kind of fruit: apples, oranges, or mangos. And each person likes a different drink: coffee, root beer, or milk.

From the clues, we know that the person who likes coffee lives next to the person who likes milk. This means they are either next to each other or one is in the house right next to the other.

We also know that the person who eats mangos lives next to the person who eats apples. This means they are either next to each other or one is in the house right next to the other.

Another clue tells us that the person who likes coffee does not live in the second house.

The last clue tells us that the person who eats apples lives in the third house.

So, if the person who eats apples lives in the third house, and the person who eats mangos lives next to the person who eats apples, then the person who eats mangos must live in the second house.

Now, we know the person who eats apples lives in the third house, and the person who eats mangos lives in the second house. This means the person who eats oranges must live in the first house.

We also know that the person who likes coffee lives next to the person who likes milk. And we know the person who likes coffee cannot live in the second house. So, the person who likes coffee must live in the first house, and the person who likes milk must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

"Let's figure out where the person with a computer lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a different device: a computer, a radio, and a television. We also know each house has different flowers: carnations, roses, and tulips. And each person plays a different sport: golf, soccer, and tennis.

From clue 1, we know the tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television.

From clue 3, we know the person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other.

"Let's figure out where the person with sandals lives.

We know the swimmer lives in the third house (clue 1). 

The person with daffodils lives in the fifth house (clue 11). 

The person with running shoes lives directly left of the person with daffodils (clue 4). Since the person with daffodils lives in the fifth house, the person with running shoes must live in the fourth house.

The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist (clue 6). The person with carnations lives to the right of the guitarist (clue 2). If the basketball player lives in the third house, the guitarist must live in the fourth house. But we already know the fourth house is occupied by the person with running shoes. So, the basketball player and the guitarist must live in the second and third houses.

The violinist lives in the second house (clue 5). This means the basketball player lives in the third house.

The person with lilies lives to the right of the person with high heels (clue 7). The person with lilies can't live in the first house because the person with high heels must live in the first house to be to the left of the person with lilies. But we already know the fourth house is occupied by the person with running shoes. This is a problem, so let's try again.

The person with loafers lives directly left of the percussionist (clue 8). The person with lilies can't live in the first house, so the person with lilies must live in the fourth house.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The people in these houses have different pets, ate different food, and wear different shoes.

We know that one person is a dog owner and one is a fish enthusiast. We also know that one person ate grilled cheese and one person ate stew. And, one person is wearing high heels and one person is wearing sandals.

The clue says that the person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means that the person who is wearing high heels lives in the house on the left.

The clue also says that the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house. Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2 from left to right, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2.

Now, let's think about the person who is wearing high heels. They live in the house on the left, which is house 1. But we also know that the person in house 1 is not the fish enthusiast. So, the person in house 1 must be the dog owner.

The person in house 2 ate grilled cheese, but we don't know if they are the fish enthusiast or the dog owner. We also know that the person in house 2 is not wearing high heels.

The person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1, and the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese. This means that the person in house 2 is the fish enthusiast.

Now, let's think about the person who had stew. We know that the person in house 1 is the dog owner, and the person in house 2 is the fish enthusiast. So, the person in house 1 must have had stew.

The answer is (A) 1."

"Let's figure out where the person who eats apples lives.

We know there are 4 houses, and each person has a favorite color, food, fruit, and drink. We also have some clues to help us solve the puzzle.

From clue 9, we know the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who had stew can't live in the third house because the person who only drinks water would be in the fourth house, and there's no room for the person who likes white to live in the second house.

So, the person who had stew lives in the fourth house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the third house. The person who likes white lives in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person who eats oranges lives directly left of the person who eats apples. This means the person who eats oranges lives in the second house, and the person who eats apples lives in the third house.

But wait, the person who eats oranges can't live in the second house because the person who likes white lives in the second house. So, the person who eats oranges lives in the third house, and the person who eats apples lives in the fourth house.

However, this is not possible because the person who had stew lives in the fourth house, and the person who eats apples can't live in the fourth house. So, the person who eats oranges lives in the second house, and the person who eats apples lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. From clue 6, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who had pizza lives in the first house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the second house.

But wait, the person who eats oranges lives in the second house, and the person who likes yellow can't live in the second house. So, the person who eats oranges lives in the third house, and the person who eats apples lives in the fourth house.

From clue 11, we know the person who eats apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza. This means the person who eats apples lives in the third house or the fourth house.

From clue 8, we know the person who had stew doesn't live in the third house. This means the person who eats apples lives in the fourth house.

The final answer is (C)."
"Let's figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

We know that there are four houses, and each house has a different person. Each person has different shoes, ate different food, likes different books, and drives a different car.

From clue 7, the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.

From clue 9, the person who drives a convertible lives to the left of the person who wears boots. This means the person who wears boots can't be in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who owns an SUV lives to the left of the person who likes history books. Since the person who drives a convertible is in the first house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the second house.

From clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes history books. This means the person who likes history books can't be in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who owns an SUV is in the second house, and the person who likes history books is to the right of the person who owns an SUV. So, the person who likes history books must be in the third house.

From clue 8, the person who likes fantasy books lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the second house, the person who likes fantasy books must be in the second house, but this contradicts clue 7. Therefore, the person who likes fantasy books must be in the third house, and the person who ate fried rice is in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who likes science fiction books. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the first house, the person who had stew must be in the first house, but this contradicts the previous conclusion that the person who ate fried rice is in the first house. Therefore, the person who had stew must be in the second house, and the person who likes fantasy books is in the third house.

From clue 3, the person who wears running shoes lives to the left of the person who wears high heels. Since the person who had stew is in the second house, the person who wears running shoes must be in the second house, and the person who wears high heels is in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who wears sandals lives to the right of the person who wears boots. Since the person who wears high heels is in the third house, the person who wears boots must be in the fourth house, and the person who wears sandals is in the fourth house.

From clue 2, the person who drives a truck lives to the left of the person who likes mystery books. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the second house, the person who drives a truck must be in the third house, and the person who likes mystery books is in the fourth house.

Now we know the order of the houses:
1. The person who ate fried rice
2. The person who had stew (wearing running shoes)
3. The person who likes fantasy books (wearing high heels)
4. The person who likes mystery books (wearing sandals)

The person who had pizza is not mentioned in any of the clues, but since the person who had stew is in the second house, the person who had pizza must be in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know there are 5 houses with people who like different kinds of books and play different musical instruments. We need to find out where the violinist lives.

From clue 7, the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. Clue 6 says the saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other. This means the violinist must live in either the third or the fifth house.

Now, let's look at clue 5. It says the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. But we already know the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. This means the saxophonist can't be the mystery book reader. So, the saxophonist and the mystery book reader can't be in the same house.

Since the saxophonist lives in the fourth house, the violinist must live in the fifth house."
"Let's figure out where the person with a gameboy lives.

We know the person with a television lives in the fourth house. 

The person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The person with a phone doesn't live in the second house.

The person wearing boots lives to the left of the person wearing loafers. Since the person wearing loafers lives in the second house, the person wearing boots must live in the first house.

There are two houses between the person with a radio and the person wearing sandals. This means the person with a radio can't live in the first or second house, because there wouldn't be two houses between them and the person wearing sandals. So the person with a radio must live in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Person wearing boots
- House 2: Person wearing loafers
- House 3: Person with a radio
- House 4: Person with a television

The only device left is the gameboy, which must be in the house of the person wearing sandals. Since the person with a radio is in the third house, the person wearing sandals must be in the first or fourth house. But the person in the first house is wearing boots, so the person wearing sandals must be in the fourth house. However, the person in the fourth house has a television. This is a contradiction, so the person wearing sandals can't be in the fourth house.

The person wearing sandals must be in the first or fourth house. The person in the first house is wearing boots, so the person wearing sandals must be in the fourth house. However, the person in the fourth house has a television. This is a contradiction, so the person wearing sandals can't be in the fourth house.

The person wearing sandals must be in the first or fourth house. The person in the first house is wearing boots, so the person wearing sandals must be in the fourth house. However, the person in the fourth house has a television. This is a contradiction, so the person wearing sandals can't be in the fourth house.

The person wearing sandals must be in the first or fourth house. The person in the first house is wearing boots, so the person wearing sandals must be in the fourth house.

"Let's figure this out.

We have three houses. One person lives in each house. Each person likes a different drink: milk, water, or coffee. And each person wears different shoes: loafers, running shoes, or high heels.

We know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house. That's clue 1.

We also know the person who likes coffee doesn't live in the second house. That's clue 2.

And the person who likes milk doesn't live in the first house. That's clue 3.

We also know the person who likes coffee doesn't live in the first house. That's clue 4.

Lastly, the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house. That's clue 5.

Let's think about it. If the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house, that means the first and second houses can't have running shoes. And we already know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

So, the first house can't have high heels or running shoes. That means the first house must have loafers.

The person who likes milk can't live in the first house, so they must live in the second or third house. But the person wearing high heels lives in the second house, so the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

Now we have the first house with loafers, the second house with high heels, and the third house with running shoes. But we still don't know who likes coffee.

The person who likes coffee can't live in the first or second house, so they must live in the third house. And the person in the third house wears running shoes, so the person in the third house must like coffee.

So, the order is:
- House 1: person with loafers
- House 2: person with high heels
- House 3: person with running shoes and who likes coffee

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure this out.

We have two houses next to each other. One person lives in house 1 and one person lives in house 2. They like different kinds of books and wear different shoes.

We know two things:
1. The person wearing loafers does not live in house 1.
2. The person who likes mystery books does not live in house 2.

Let's think about it. If the person wearing loafers doesn't live in house 1, then they must live in house 2. And if the person who likes mystery books doesn't live in house 2, then they must live in house 1.

So, the person in house 1 likes mystery books and the person in house 2 wears loafers. That means the person in house 2 must like history books and the person in house 1 must wear high heels.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

We know that the person who had pizza lives next to the person who is wearing sandals. 

We also know that the person who is wearing boots lives to the left of the person who had pizza.

Now, let's think about the people and their things. We know that the person who has a vase of tulips lives to the left of the person who had pizza.

We also know that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.

Let's put the people in order from left to right. We know that the person who is wearing running shoes lives next to the person who has a gameboy, and they live next to each other. We also know that the person who is wearing running shoes lives next to the person who has a rose bouquet.

The person who is wearing running shoes can't live in the third house, so they must live in the first or second house.

If the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, then the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house, and the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house. But that can't be right, because the person who is wearing running shoes can't live in the third house.

So, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the second house. The person who has a gameboy lives in the first house, and the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

Now, let's think about the people and their things again. We know that the person who has a vase of tulips lives to the left of the person who had pizza. We also know that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.

The person who had pizza can't live in the first house, because the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house. The person who had pizza can't live in the second house, because the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house. The person who had pizza can't live in the third house, because the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

So, the person who had pizza must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A)."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have two houses next to each other. One person lives in each house. We know some things about them:

- One person is eating mangos and the other is eating apples.
- One person has a rose bouquet and the other has lilies.
- One person plays the piano and the other plays the saxophone.

We also know some clues:

1. The person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the lilies.
2. The person who plays the saxophone does not live in the first house.
3. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.

Since the person eating mangos lives in the first house, the person eating apples must live in the second house. 

Now, let's think about the person with the rose bouquet. They have to live in the first house because the person with the lilies can't live in the first house (because the person eating mangos lives there), and the person with the rose bouquet has to live to the left of the person with the lilies.

So, we have the person with the rose bouquet in the first house, the person eating mangos in the first house, and the person eating apples in the second house.

But we still don't know who plays the saxophone. We know it's not the person in the first house, so it must be the person in the second house.

So, the person eating apples lives in the second house.

The answer is: **(B)**"
"Let's figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

We know that the person who has a radio lives in the first house. 

From clue 15, the person who has a radio lives in the first house.

From clue 14, the basketball player lives directly left of the person who likes red.

From clue 12, the person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other.

From clue 13, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover.

So, the order of the first three houses is: 1 (radio) - 2 (basketball player) - 3 (minivan).

From clue 10, the person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer.

From clue 14, the basketball player lives directly left of the person who likes red.

So, the order of the first three houses is: 1 (radio) - 2 (basketball player) - 3 (person who likes red).

From clue 10, the person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer.

So, the order of the first four houses is: 1 (radio) - 2 (basketball player) - 3 (person who likes red) - 4 (golfer).

From clue 5, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (E) 4."
"Let's figure out who lives in which house.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a different kind of car and a different kind of flowers. The cars are a sedan, an SUV, and a truck. The flowers are tulips, a rose bouquet, and a bouquet of lilies.

We also know some clues:

1. The person with tulips doesn't live in the third house.
2. The person with an SUV lives next to the person with lilies.
3. The person with a sedan and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other.
4. The person with a rose bouquet doesn't live in the second house.

Let's start with clue 4. If the person with a rose bouquet doesn't live in the second house, they must live in either the first or the third house.

Now, let's look at clue 3. The person with a sedan and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other. This means they can't live in the second house because the person with a rose bouquet can't live in the second house. So, the person with a sedan and the person with a rose bouquet must live in the first and third houses.

But wait, clue 2 says the person with an SUV lives next to the person with lilies. If the person with lilies lives in the third house, the person with an SUV must live in the second house. But we already said the person with a sedan and the person with a rose bouquet live in the first and third houses. This means the person with a sedan lives in the second house, and the person with an SUV lives in the first house.

Now we have a problem. We said the person with a sedan lives in the second house, but we also said the person with a rose bouquet lives in the first house. This means the person with a sedan can't live in the second house. So, the person with a sedan must live in the first house, and the person with a rose bouquet must live in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Sedan
- House 2: SUV
- House 3: Rose bouquet

But we still need to figure out who has tulips. Clue 1 says the person with tulips doesn't live in the third house. This is true because the person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house. So, the person with tulips must live in either the first or the second house. But we already said the person with a sedan lives in the first house, so the person with tulips must live in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Sedan
- House 2: Tulips
- House 3: Rose bouquet

The person who drives a truck is the only one left, and they must live in the first house is incorrect. The person who drives a truck must live in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes milk lives.

From clue 4, the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From clue 12, the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.

Let's try to figure out the order of the houses.

House 1: History book buff (from clue 13) and the person with a carnations arrangement (from clue 6) live in the first house. The person with a carnations arrangement lives left of the pianist, so the pianist lives in the second house.

House 2: Pianist (from clue 6) and the person with a carnations arrangement live in the second house.

House 3: The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house (from clue 10), so the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live next to each other (from clue 4), and the person with a rose bouquet cannot live in the fourth house because the person with a bouquet of lilies lives there. So, the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live in the third house.

House 3: The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live in the third house.

House 4: The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

House 5: The person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.

Now, let's figure out the order of the people with instruments.

From clue 1, the violinist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. The science fiction book fanatic cannot live in the second house (from clue 11), so the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house. The violinist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, so the violinist lives in the second house is not possible. The violinist lives in the third house.

House 1: Science fiction book fanatic

House 2: Pianist

House 3: Violinist

House 4: The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

House 5: The person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.

From clue 7, the percussionist lives to the left of the mystery book reader. The mystery book reader lives next to the pianist (from clue 15), so the mystery book reader lives in the second house.

House 1: History book buff and percussionist

House 2: Pianist and mystery book reader

House 3: Violinist

House 4: The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

House 5: The person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.

House 4: The person with a bouquet of lilies and the person who only drinks water

House 5: The person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.

"Let's figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

We know that there are two houses next to each other, one on the left and one on the right. The people in these houses have different characteristics.

- One person ate fried rice and the other person ate spaghetti.
- One person loves cats and the other person loves horses.
- One person likes history books and the other person likes romance books.
- One person is wearing sandals and the other person is wearing running shoes.

We have a clue: The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.

This means that the person who owns horses lives in the right house. And the person who is wearing sandals lives in the left house.

We also have another clue: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

This means that the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the right house because the history book buff lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the left house.

But wait, we already said that the person who is wearing sandals lives in the left house. And we also know that the person who owns horses lives in the right house. This means that the person who ate spaghetti must be in the right house, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in the left house.

Now, let's think about the person who ate fried rice. We know that the person who ate spaghetti is in the right house, so the person who ate fried rice must be in the left house.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 1."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The people in these houses have different flowers, instruments, and cars.

We know that one person has a bouquet of lilies and one has a bouquet of daffodils. One person plays the flute and one plays the saxophone. One person drives a convertible and one drives a sedan.

Clue 1 says that the person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the person with the sedan lives in the left house.

Clue 2 says the flutist does not live in the first house. This means the flutist lives in the second house.

Now, let's think about the person with the saxophone. If the flutist lives in the second house, the saxophonist must live in the first house.

So, the person with the sedan lives in the first house, the person with the saxophone lives in the first house, and the person with the sedan lives to the left of the person with the lilies. This means the person with the lilies lives in the second house.

The correct answer is: **(B) 2**"

From clue 8, we know there's one house between the person with daffodils and the person with a rose bouquet. This means the person with daffodils lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the golfer lives to the right of the person with daffodils. Since the person with daffodils lives in the second house, the golfer must live in the third or fourth house. But the person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house, so the golfer must live in the fourth house. This means the person with daffodils lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the swimmer. Since the person with daffodils lives in the second house, the swimmer must live in the third house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the tennis player lives to the right of the mystery book reader. Since the person with daffodils lives in the second house and the swimmer lives in the third house, the mystery book reader must live in the first house. This means the tennis player lives in the fourth house.

But wait, we already know the person with carnations lives in the fourth house. This means the tennis player can't live in the fourth house.

From clue 1, we know there's one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer. Since the mystery book reader lives in the first house and the swimmer lives in the third house, this clue is already true.

From clue 2, we know the tennis player lives to the right of the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader lives in the first house, the tennis player lives in the third house. But we already know the person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house. This means the tennis player can't live in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the tennis player doesn't live in the fourth house. This means the tennis player lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the swimmer. Since the person with daffodils lives in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. But we already know the tennis player lives in the second house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast can't live in the second house.

"Let's try to figure out where the person who likes white lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each house has a different person. Each person ate something different for lunch: pizza, stew, grilled cheese, fried rice, and spaghetti. Each person also likes a different color: blue, yellow, white, green, and red.

From clue 7, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From clue 8, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

Let's try to place the person who likes white in the first house. If the person who likes white lives in the first house, then the person who likes red must live in the second house (from clue 6), the person who had stew must live in the third house (as the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew), the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house (as the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white), and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fifth house (as the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti). However, this would mean the person who likes green lives in the fifth house (as the person who likes green does not live in the second house), which is correct.

But wait, we can't have the person who likes green in the fifth house because the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fifth house. So, let's try to place the person who likes white in the second house. If the person who likes white lives in the second house, then the person who likes red must live in the first house (from clue 6), the person who had stew must live in the third house (as the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew), the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house (as the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white), and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fifth house (as the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

"Let's figure out where the basketball player lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a person in it. Each person likes a different color (red, yellow, or green), plays a different instrument (piano, violin, or percussion), and plays a different sport (baseball, tennis, or basketball).

From the clues, we know:

- The person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The person who likes yellow doesn't live in the second house.
- The percussionist lives in the second house.
- The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player.
- The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player.

Let's start with the percussionist. We know they live in the second house.

Now, let's think about the person who likes yellow. If they don't live in the second house, they must live in either the first or third house. But we know the person who likes red lives in the third house, so the person who likes yellow must live in the first house.

Now, let's think about the basketball player. We know they live to the right of the tennis player, and the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. This means the basketball player must live in the second house, because if they lived in the third house, the violinist would have to live in the fourth house, but there are only three houses.

So, the basketball player lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (C)."
"Let's figure out where the person with a carnations arrangement lives.

We have 5 houses, and each house has a different person. Each person has a different flower, a different musical instrument, a favorite drink, and a different device.

From clue 1, the person with a computer lives to the left of the person who likes root beer.

From clue 3, the person who likes root beer and the person who likes coffee live next to each other.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person with a phone and the person with a television.

From clue 5, the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the cellist.

From clue 6, the percussionist lives to the right of the person with a gameboy.

From clue 7, the person with a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.

From clue 8, there is one house between the cellist and the guitarist.

From clue 9, the cellist does not live in the fourth house.

From clue 10, the person who likes coffee lives to the right of the person who likes milk.

From clue 11, the guitarist lives to the right of the person with a phone.

From clue 12, the person who likes root beer lives to the left of the percussionist.

From clue 13, the person who likes root beer lives to the left of the person with a bouquet of lilies.

From clue 14, there is one house between the person with a bouquet of daffodils and the person who likes coffee.

From clue 15, the person with a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 16, the person who likes tea lives to the left of the pianist.

Let's start with clue 1. The person with a computer lives to the left of the person who likes root beer. This means the person with a computer cannot be in the first house.

Now, let's think about the person who likes root beer. The person who likes root beer and the person who likes coffee live next to each other (clue 3). This means they can be in the second or the fourth house.

If the person who likes root beer is in the second house, the person with a computer must be in the first house. But we already know the person with a computer cannot be in the first house (clue 1). So, the person who likes root beer must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's think about the person with a bouquet of daffodils. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the cellist (clue 5). This means the person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in the fifth house.

The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the cellist, and the cellist does not live in the fourth house (clue 9). This means the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in the third house.

But we already know the person with a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house (clue 7). This means the person with a carnations arrangement must be in the first house.

The correct answer is (B) 2 is incorrect, the correct answer is (A) 1"
"Let's figure out where the person who drives a minivan lives.

From clue 1, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.

"Let's figure out where the person with a vase of tulips lives.

We know that the person who drives a convertible lives next to the person with a vase of tulips. We also know that there are two houses between the person who drives a truck and the person who drives a convertible.

Let's start by looking at the houses. We have houses 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

We know that the dog owner lives in the second house. The person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the dog owner, so the dog owner is in house 2 and the person who drives a minivan is in house 3 or 4 or 5.

We also know that the fish enthusiast lives in the third house. Since the person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the dog owner, the fish enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's look at the person who drives a truck. We know that the person who drives a truck lives two houses to the left of the person who drives a convertible. We also know that the person who drives a truck lives to the left of the person who has a computer.

Let's try to figure out where the person who drives a truck lives. If the person who drives a truck lives in house 1, then the person who drives a convertible would be in house 4, which is three houses to the right of the person who drives a truck. But we know that there are only two houses between the person who drives a truck and the person who drives a convertible. So, the person who drives a truck cannot live in house 1.

If the person who drives a truck lives in house 2, then the person who drives a convertible would be in house 5, which is three houses to the right of the person who drives a truck. But we know that there are only two houses between the person who drives a truck and the person who drives a convertible. So, the person who drives a truck cannot live in house 2.

If the person who drives a truck lives in house 3, then the person who drives a convertible would be in house 5, which is two houses to the right of the person who drives a truck. This works!

Now, let's look at the person who has a vase of tulips. We know that the person who has a vase of tulips lives next to the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in house 5, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in house 4.

The correct answer is:

(B) 4"
"Let's figure out where the dog owner lives.

We know there's a basketball player in the first house. We also know there's a saxophonist in the first house. So, the basketball player and the saxophonist must be in the first house.

Now, let's think about what the person in the second house had for lunch. We know the person who had stew is to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk can't be in the first house, the person who had stew must be in the second house.

The person who likes milk must be in the third house because the person who had stew is in the second house.

Now, let's think about the tea drinker. The tea drinker lives to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer can't be in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the second house.

But wait, we already said the person who had stew is in the second house. So, the person who had stew and the tea drinker must be in the second house. This means the person who likes milk is in the third house.

Now, let's think about the person who had pizza. The person who had pizza lives to the left of the dog owner. Since the person who had pizza can't be in the third house, the person who had pizza must be in the first house.

The person who had pizza is in the first house, and the basketball player is in the first house. So, the person who had pizza must be the basketball player. But we already said the basketball player is in the first house, so this is okay.

Now, let's think about the person who only drinks water. There's one house between the person who only drinks water and the fish enthusiast. Since the person who had stew is in the second house, the person who only drinks water must be in the first house.

But we already said the person who had pizza is in the first house. So, the person who only drinks water must be in the first house, and the person who had pizza must be in the first house. This means the person who had pizza is not the basketball player. The person who had pizza must be the saxophonist.

Now, let's think about the cat lover. There's one house between the cat lover and the guitarist. Since the guitarist is in the third house, the cat lover must be in the second house.

But we already said the person who had stew is in the second house, and the person who likes milk is in the third house. So, the person who had stew is the cat lover. But we already said the cat lover is in the second house, and the person who had stew is in the second house. This is okay.

Now, let's think about the dog owner. The person who had pizza lives to the left of the dog owner. Since the person who had pizza is in the first house, the dog owner must be in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person with a bouquet of lilies lives.

We know the history book buff lives in the first house. 

The cat lover doesn't live in the second house, so the cat lover must live in the first house.

The person with a computer lives to the right of the person with loafers. Since the history book buff lives in the first house, the person with a computer must live in the second house.

The person with high heels lives to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the cat lover lives in the first house, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in the second house.

Now we have this:
- The history book buff lives in the first house.
- The cat lover lives in the first house.
- The person with a computer lives in the second house.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.

The person in the first house must be wearing loafers, and the person in the second house must be wearing high heels.

The person in the first house has a bouquet of lilies, and the person in the second house has a bouquet of daffodils.

So, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.

"Let's figure out where the pianist lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a person living in it. Each person plays a different instrument: violin, flute, and piano. They also eat different fruits: kiwi, grapes, and oranges.

Clue 1: The pianist and the person eating kiwi live next to each other.

Clue 2: The flute player lives to the right of the violin player.

Clue 3: There's one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwi.

Clue 4: There's one house between the violin player and the person eating kiwi.

Let's think about it. If the violin player is in house 1, the person eating kiwi would be in house 3, and the person eating grapes would be in house 2. But that's not right because the pianist and the person eating kiwi live next to each other.

If the violin player is in house 2, the person eating grapes would be in house 1, and the person eating kiwi would be in house 3. But that's not right again because the pianist and the person eating kiwi live next to each other.

If the violin player is in house 3, the person eating grapes would be in house 1, and the person eating kiwi would be in house 2. This looks good because the pianist and the person eating kiwi live next to each other.

Now, let's think about the flute player. The flute player lives to the right of the violin player. If the violin player is in house 3, the flute player would be in house 3 too. But that's not right because the pianist and the person eating kiwi live next to each other, and the flute player would be in the way.

So, the violin player must be in house 2, the person eating grapes is in house 1, and the person eating kiwi is in house 3. The pianist must be in house 3 because the pianist and the person eating kiwi live next to each other.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's figure this out.

We have two houses next to each other. One person lives in house 1 and one person lives in house 2. They like different kinds of books and eat different kinds of fruit.

We know that one person eats kiwis and lives in house 1. That's the first clue.

The second clue says that the person who likes fantasy books doesn't live in house 1.

So, if the person who eats kiwis lives in house 1, then the person in house 2 must eat oranges.

And since the person who likes fantasy books doesn't live in house 1, they must live in house 2.

So, the person who likes fantasy books lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes red lives.

We know there are four houses, and each house has a different person. Each person has a different device, favorite color, food, and pet.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From clue 10, we know the person who has a television lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. So, the person who has a television lives in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other. But we already know the person who has a television lives in the second house. So, the bird keeper must live in the second house, but that's not possible because the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. This means the bird keeper lives in the second house, and the person who has a television lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes green doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who likes green lives in the first, third, or fourth house.

From clue 8, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. And from clue 2, we know the person who likes green doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who likes green must live in the first or fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house. From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the dog owner. But the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house. However, that's not possible because the person who had pizza can't live in the third house (clue 6). So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house, and the person who had pizza must live in the third house.

From clue 9, we know the person who has a radio lives in the third house. And we already know the person who likes red lives in the third house. So, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Let's figure this out.

We have two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The person in the left house plays a different instrument than the person in the right house. One person likes root beer and the other person likes tea.

We know that the person who likes root beer does not live in the right house. And we also know that the person who plays the piano lives next to the person who plays the cello.

Since the person who plays the piano lives next to the person who plays the cello, the piano player must live in the left house and the cello player must live in the right house.

So, the person who likes root beer must live in the left house. The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure out where the person with a bouquet of lilies lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each house has a different person. Each person has different shoes and different flowers.

From clue 1, the person with boots and the person with carnations lives next to each other. The person with carnations lives in the fifth house.

From clue 2, the person with tulips lives to the left of the person with loafers. But the person with tulips can't live in the fourth house (clue 6), so the person with tulips must live in the first or second house.

From clue 8, the person with daffodils and the person with running shoes live next to each other. They can't live in the fourth or fifth house because the person with boots and the person with carnations live next to each other in those houses.

From clue 5, the person with tulips lives to the right of the person with daffodils. So, the person with tulips must live in the second house, and the person with daffodils must live in the first house.

From clue 8, the person with running shoes must live in the third house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person with running shoes and the person with lilies. Since the person with running shoes lives in the third house, the person with lilies must live in the fifth house. But we already know the person with carnations lives in the fifth house, so the person with lilies can't live in the fifth house.

Let's try again. From clue 5, the person with tulips lives to the right of the person with daffodils. So, the person with tulips must live in the third house, and the person with daffodils must live in the second house.

From clue 8, the person with running shoes must live in the first house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person with running shoes and the person with lilies. Since the person with running shoes lives in the first house, the person with lilies must live in the third house.

From clue 2, the person with tulips lives to the left of the person with loafers. Since the person with tulips lives in the third house, the person with loafers must live in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the person with carnations lives in the fifth house.

So, the order of the houses is: 1 (running shoes), 2 (daffodils), 3 (tulips), 4 (loafers), 5 (carnations).

The person with lilies must live in the house that is not yet assigned, which is the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."

"Let's figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

We know that there are three houses, and each person in the houses likes a different color, ate a different food, and wears different shoes.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes white lives in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes green lives in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person who had stew does not live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in either the first or the third house.

From clue 6, we know the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who likes white lives in the first house, the person who had stew cannot live in the first house, so the person who had stew must live in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who had stew lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the second house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person who likes white lives in the first house.
- The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.
- The person who had stew lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
- The person who likes green lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house. Since the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in either the first or the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person who likes white lives in the first house.
- The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
- The person who had stew lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.

"Let's figure this out.

We have two houses next to each other. One person lives in each house. We know some things about them:

- One person drinks coffee and one person drinks water.
- One person wears loafers and one person wears sandals.
- One person loves science fiction books and one person loves romance books.

We also know that the person who drinks coffee lives to the left of the person who wears sandals. And we know the person who loves science fiction books lives in the first house.

So, the first house must be the science fiction book lover. And since the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who wears sandals, the coffee drinker must also be in the first house.

Now, let's think about the second house. We know the person in the second house drinks water, because the person in the first house drinks coffee. And we know the person in the second house wears sandals, because the person in the first house wears loafers.

The only thing we don't know is what kind of book the person in the second house likes. But we do know that the person in the second house is not a science fiction book lover, because that person is in the first house. And the person in the second house is not a coffee drinker, because that person is in the first house too.

So, the person in the second house must be the romance book lover. The correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"Let's figure this out.

We have two houses next to each other. One person lives in each house. They like different things:

- One person plays the piano.
- One person plays the drums (that's called a percussionist).
- One person has a radio.
- One person has a phone.

We know that the person who plays the drums lives next to the person who has a radio. And the person who has a radio lives in the house on the right.

So, the person who plays the drums lives in the house on the left. And the person who has a radio lives in the house on the right.

Now, we need to find out who has the phone. If the person who has the radio lives in the house on the right, then the person who has the phone must live in the house on the left.

So, the answer is: **(A)**"
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have three houses with people in them. Each person likes a different color: white, blue, or yellow. They also have different cars: a minivan, a convertible, and a sedan.

We know that the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. That's a good clue!

Now, let's think about the person who likes yellow. We know they live next to the person who owns a sedan. This means the person who likes yellow can't live in the third house because then they wouldn't be next to the person who owns a sedan.

So, the person who likes yellow must live in either the first or second house. But we already know the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. This means the person who likes yellow must live in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."

"Let's figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

We know there are three houses, and each person ate something different for lunch: fried rice, spaghetti, or grilled cheese. We also know that everyone likes a different kind of book: science fiction, fantasy, or mystery.

From the clues, we know:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house, the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be the same person. But we also know the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house.

Now, let's think about the person who ate spaghetti. We know they live to the left of the person who ate fried rice, but we already know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house. So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house, but that's not possible because the science fiction book fanatic lives there. This means the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

The only person left is the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure this out.

We have two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The left house is number 1, and the right house is number 2. There's a person living in each house.

We know two things:

1. One person has a vase of tulips, and the other person has a carnations arrangement.
2. One person has a dog, and the other person has horses.
3. The person with the carnations arrangement lives to the left of the person with the dog.

Since the houses are numbered from left to right, the person with the carnations arrangement must live in the left house, which is house 1.

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure out where the person wearing high heels lives.

We know there are two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2). There's a person in each house.

From clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis lives in the second house (house 2).

From clue 2, we know the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person wearing sandals lives in the first house (house 1).

Now, let's think about clue 1. It says the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person wearing high heels. This means the person wearing high heels lives in the second house (house 2).

But wait, we already know the person eating kiwis lives in house 2. So, the person wearing high heels can't live in house 2. This is a problem!

Let's think again. Clue 2 says the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person wearing sandals lives in house 1, and the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

So, the person wearing high heels must live in house 1. But we already know the person wearing sandals lives in house 1. This is another problem!

Let's think again. Clue 2 says the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person wearing sandals lives in house 1, and the person who likes yellow lives in house 1. The person wearing high heels must live in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person eating kiwis lives.

We know that one person is wearing high heels and one person is wearing sandals. The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. This means the person wearing high heels lives in house 1, and the person wearing sandals lives in house 2.

We also know that the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other. Since the person wearing sandals lives in house 2, the person eating grapes must live in house 2 too. But that can't be right, because the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals can't live in the same house. So, the person eating grapes must live in house 1, and the person wearing sandals lives in house 2.

Now we know that the person eating grapes lives in house 1 and the person wearing sandals lives in house 2. The person eating grapes can't live in house 2 because the person wearing sandals lives there. So, the person eating grapes lives in house 1.

We also know that the person with a television lives to the right of the person who drinks tea. Since the person eating grapes lives in house 1, the person drinking tea must live in house 1. But that can't be right, because the person with a television lives to the right of the person drinking tea. So, the person drinking tea must live in house 2, and the person with a television lives in house 1.

Now we know that the person drinking tea lives in house 2 and the person with a television lives in house 1. We also know that the person eating kiwis lives in the house with the person with a television. So, the person eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have three houses with people living in them. Each person likes a different drink: milk, tea, or water. They also play different instruments: violin, cello, or guitar.

Clue 1: The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who plays the cello.

Clue 2: There is one house between where the person who plays the violin lives and where the person who plays the guitar lives.

Clue 3: The person who likes tea lives in the first house.

Clue 4: The person who plays the violin does not live in the third house.

Let's start with Clue 3. The person who likes tea lives in the first house.

Now, let's think about Clue 4. The person who plays the violin does not live in the third house. This means the person who plays the violin can either live in the first or the second house.

If the person who plays the violin lives in the first house, then the person who plays the guitar would live in the third house. But Clue 2 says there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist. So, if the violinist is in the first house, the guitarist can't be in the third house. This doesn't make sense.

So, the person who plays the violin must live in the second house. Now, let's think about Clue 1. The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who plays the cello. This means the person who plays the cello must live in the first house, but we already know the person who likes tea lives in the first house. This can't be true because the person who likes tea can't play the cello.

So, the person who plays the cello must live in the second house. And the person who only drinks water must live in the third house.

Now, we have the order: 
- House 1: Tea drinker (plays an unknown instrument)
- House 2: Cellist (plays an unknown instrument)
- House 3: Water drinker (plays an unknown instrument)

Since the violinist lives in the second house, the cellist must be in the second house, and the guitarist must be in the third house.

The answer is: **(A) 2**"
"Let's figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each person has different shoes and drinks different things. We also know some clues:

1. The person who wears sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who wears running shoes doesn't live in the first house.
3. The person who wears sandals lives next to the person who only drinks water.
4. The person who likes tea lives in the fifth house.
5. There's one house between the person who likes coffee and the person who wears loafers.
6. The person who only drinks water lives to the left of the person who wears boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who wears sandals lives next to the person who only drinks water. Since the person who wears sandals lives in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Let's figure out where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each house has a different device and a different food. The devices are: phone, gameboy, computer, radio, and television. The foods are: spaghetti, pizza, stew, grilled cheese, and fried rice.

Clue 1 says the person with a gameboy and the person with a computer live next to each other. This means they can't be in the same house, and there must be one house between them.

Clue 2 says the person with a television lives to the left of the person with a phone. This means the person with a phone can't be in the first house.

Clue 3 says there's one house between the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a radio. This means the person who has a radio can't be in the first or second house.

Clue 4 says there's one house between the person who has a gameboy and the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who ate fried rice can't be in the first or second house.

Clue 5 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti can't be in the first house.

Clue 6 says the person who has a radio doesn't live in the fourth house.

Clue 7 says the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

Clue 8 says the person who has a computer doesn't live in the fourth house.

Let's think about the clues together. We know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. We also know the person who has a computer and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. Since the person who has a computer can't live in the fourth house, the person who has a gameboy must live in either the first or second house.

The person who has a radio can't live in the fourth house, and there's one house between the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a radio. This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in either the first or second house.

The person who ate spaghetti can't live in the first house, because the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

The person who has a television lives to the left of the person who has a phone. The person who has a phone can't live in the first house, so the person who has a television must live in either the first or second house.

The person who ate fried rice can't live in the first or second house, because there's one house between the person who has a gameboy and the person who ate fried rice.

Let's put all the clues together. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. The person who has a computer and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. The person who has a radio can't live in the fourth house, and there's one house between the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a radio. The person who ate spaghetti can't live in the first house. The person who has a television lives to the left of the person who has a phone. The person who has a phone can't live in the first house. The person who ate fried rice can't live in the first or second house.

The only house left for the person who ate spaghetti is the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's figure out where the person who is eating a banana lives.

We know there are 5 houses, and each house has a person with different characteristics. We need to find out who eats a banana.

From clue 16, the tennis player lives in the first house.

From clue 12, the tennis player and the baseball player live next to each other. So, the baseball player lives in the second house.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives in the second house. But wait, we already know the baseball player lives in the second house. This is a problem! Let's try again.

From clue 12, the tennis player and the baseball player live next to each other. Since the tennis player is in the first house, the baseball player must be in the first house. But clue 6 says the dog owner can't live in the first house. This means the bird keeper can't live in the second house.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives in the second house. This means the baseball player must live in the first house, and the tennis player must live in the third house.

From clue 6, the dog owner can't live in the first house. This means the dog owner lives in the third house, but this is a problem because clue 11 says the saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since the tennis player lives in the third house, the saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first and second houses.

From clue 11, the saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since the saxophonist lives in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house. But this is a problem because clue 3 says the baseball player and the person who ate fried rice live next to each other. This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house, and the saxophonist must live in the second house.

From clue 3, the baseball player and the person who ate fried rice live next to each other. Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana must live in the second and fourth houses.

From clue 18, the pianist can't live in the third house. This means the pianist lives in the fourth house.

From clue 1, the pianist lives next to the person who owns horses. Since the pianist lives in the fourth house, the person who owns horses must live in the fifth house.

From clue 15, the person who is eating mangos lives to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the person who owns horses lives in the fifth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the fifth house.

From clue 5, the person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live next to each other. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the fourth house.

From clue 19, the person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the golfer. Since the person who is eating oranges lives in the fourth house, the golfer must live in the third house.

From clue 14, there is one house between the saxophonist and the golfer. Since the saxophonist lives in the second house and the golfer lives in the third house, this is true.

From clue 7, the cellist can't live in the fifth house. This means the cellist lives in the first, second, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the saxophonist, the second house is occupied by the saxophonist, and the third house is occupied by the golfer. This means the cellist must live in the fourth house, but this is a problem because clue 18 says the pianist can't live in the third house. This means the cellist must live in the first house.

From clue 13, the basketball player lives to the left of the cat lover. Since the cellist lives in the first house, the basketball player must live in the second house, and the cat lover must live in the third house.

From clue 20, the person who had pizza can't live in the fifth house. This means the person who had pizza lives in the first, second, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the cellist, the second house is occupied by the saxophonist, the third house is occupied by the golfer, and the fourth house is occupied by the pianist. This means the person who had pizza must live in the fifth house.

From clue 9, the person who owns horses lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house, the person who owns horses must live in the fifth house.

From clue 17, the percussionist lives in the fourth house. But this is a problem because clue 18 says the pianist can't live in the third house. This means the percussionist must live in the fourth house, and the pianist must live in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other. Since the person who had stew lives in the second house, the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have two houses next to each other. One person lives in each house. They all have different things: one plays a different instrument, one ate different food, and one has a different pet.

Clue 1 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper can't live in the second house because then the person who ate grilled cheese would be in the same house as the bird keeper. So, the bird keeper must live in the first house.

Clue 2 says the person who plays the drums (percussionist) doesn't live in the second house. Since the bird keeper lives in the first house, the person who plays the drums must live in the second house.

Now we have:
- Bird keeper lives in house 1
- Drums player lives in house 2

Clue 1 also says the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper lives in house 1, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in house 2. But we already know the drums player lives in house 2, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be the drums player.

Now we have:
- Bird keeper lives in house 1
- Drums player (who ate grilled cheese) lives in house 2

The only person left is the guitarist. They must live in house 1. And since the person in house 1 ate pizza, the answer is:

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure out where the bird keeper lives.

We know there are four houses, and each house has a different person. Each person has a different pet, a different car, and plays a different sport.

From clue 2, we know the bird keeper lives in the third house.

From clue 8, we know the soccer player lives to the left of the bird keeper. 

From clue 9, we know the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the soccer player. 

So, the order of houses from left to right is: fish enthusiast, soccer player, bird keeper.

From clue 1, we know the cat lover does not live in the second house. 

From clue 5, we know the baseball player does not live in the third house. 

From clue 7, we know the person who owns a sedan lives to the right of the baseball player.

From clue 3, we know the golfer lives to the left of the person who drives a truck.

From clue 4, we know the person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.

From clue 6, we know the person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.

Now, let's think about the cars. We know the person who drives a truck lives in the fourth house. The person who drives a convertible cannot live in the first or third house, so they must live in the second house.

The order of houses from left to right is: fish enthusiast, soccer player, bird keeper, and the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

The baseball player lives to the left of the person who owns a sedan, so the baseball player lives in the first house.

The cat lover cannot live in the second house, so the cat lover lives in the fourth house.

The person who owns a sedan lives to the right of the baseball player, so the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The fish enthusiast lives to the left of the soccer player, so the fish enthusiast lives in the first house is incorrect, so the fish enthusiast lives in the second house is incorrect, so the fish enthusiast lives in the third house is incorrect, so the fish enthusiast lives in the second house is correct.

The correct order of houses from left to right is: baseball player, fish enthusiast, bird keeper, cat lover.

The bird keeper lives in the third house.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's solve the puzzle.

We know there are three houses with people in them. Each person has different pets, plays a different instrument, eats a different fruit, wears different shoes, and likes a different book.

From clue 10, we know the cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person eating a banana. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the person eating a banana must be in the second house, and the fish enthusiast must be in the third house.

From clue 9, the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the flutist must be in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house. But this contradicts clue 10, which says the cat lover lives in the first house. So, the fantasy book enthusiast cannot be in the first house.

From clue 9, the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

From clue 8, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person wearing running shoes. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the person wearing running shoes must be in the second house.

From clue 7, the person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist. Since the person eating oranges cannot be in the first house (because the cat lover is in the first house), the pianist must be in the first house, and the person eating oranges must be in the third house.

From clue 6, the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the flutist is also in the third house. But this contradicts the previous conclusion that the flutist is in the third house. So, the flutist must be in the second house, and the person eating oranges must be in the third house.

From clue 1, the person wearing loafers does not live in the second house. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the person wearing loafers must be in the first house.

From clue 2, the percussionist does not live in the second house. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the percussionist must be in the first house.

From clue 4, the history book buff does not live in the second house. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the history book buff must be in the first house.

From clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the third house. But this contradicts the previous conclusion that the fantasy book enthusiast is in the third house. So, the person wearing running shoes must be in the first house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house.

Now, let's look at the remaining options. The person in the first house is wearing loafers, is a percussionist, and likes a history book. The person in the second house is eating a banana, is a flutist, and likes a fantasy book. The person in the third house is a fish enthusiast, is eating oranges, and likes a science fiction book.

The correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

From clue 6, we know the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.

Let's try to figure out the order of the houses. Since the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house, the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in the first and third houses, or the second and fourth houses. But since the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house, the person who likes green and the person who likes red cannot be in the second and fourth houses. So, the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in the first and third houses.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes green and the person who likes red are in the first and third houses, the person who likes yellow must be in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. Since the person who is eating a banana cannot be in the first house (because the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house), the person who is eating a banana must be in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who likes white must be in the second house.

However, we already know the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who likes white must be eating grapes, and the person who is eating grapes must be eating a different fruit. This is a contradiction, so we must re-evaluate our previous conclusions.

"Let's figure out where the person who had stew lives.

We know that there are two houses next to each other, one on the left and one on the right. Each person in the houses has different things: they ate different food, have different pets, eat different fruits, like different books, and wear different shoes.

From the clues, we know:

1. The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges.
2. The person who likes mystery books lives next to the person who likes cats.
3. The person who likes mystery books and the person who had stew live next to each other.

Let's think about it. If the person who likes mystery books lives next to the person who likes cats, and they live next to the person who had stew, then the person who had stew must like cats.

Now, let's think about the person eating oranges. The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges. This means the person eating oranges can't be wearing running shoes.

So, the person eating oranges must be wearing sandals. And the person wearing running shoes must be eating something else.

We also know that the person who had stew likes cats, and the person eating oranges is wearing sandals. Let's put it together:

- The person who had stew (cat lover) lives next to the person who likes mystery books.
- The person eating oranges is wearing sandals.
- The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges.

The only way this can work is if the person who had stew lives in the second house, and the person eating oranges lives in the first house. The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes milk lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a different person. Each person has a different flower, a different drink, and a different device.

From clue 1, we know the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person with a phone. This means the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house, and the person with a phone lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. But we already know the person with a phone lives in the second house, so the person with a phone must be the person who only drinks water.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in the first house. This means the person with a bouquet of daffodils is not the root beer lover.

From clue 5, we know the person with a television lives somewhere to the right of the person with a vase of tulips. This means the person with a vase of tulips lives in the first house, and the person with a television lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person with a television does not live in the second house. We already know the person with a television lives in the third house, so this clue is true.

Now, let's think about the person who likes milk. We know the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house, the person with a phone lives in the second house, and the person with a television lives in the third house. The only house left is the third house, so the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

The person eating grapes lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. That's clue 3. This means the person eating grapes lives in the first house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the second house.

The person eating kiwis doesn't live in the first house. That's clue 7. This means the person eating kiwis lives in the second or third house.

The person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person who likes milk. That's clue 5. This means the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, and the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The person wearing boots lives to the right of the person with a gameboy. That's clue 6. This means the person with a gameboy lives in the second house, and the person wearing boots lives in the third house.

But wait, clue 4 says the person wearing boots doesn't live in the third house. This is a trick! We already know the person wearing boots lives in the third house, so this clue doesn't help us.

So, we have the person with a phone in the first house, the person eating grapes in the first house, and the person eating kiwis in the second house. This means the person with a computer lives in the second house.

The person with carnations arrangement lives to the left of the baseball player, and the person with horses lives next to the person with carnations. This means the person with carnations must be in the first house, and the person with horses must be in the second house.

The cricketer cannot be in the third house, so the cricketer must be in the first or second house. However, the first house is already occupied by the person with a rose bouquet, so the cricketer must be in the second house.

But wait, this means the person with carnations arrangement cannot be in the first house because the cricketer is in the second house. This means the person with carnations arrangement must be in the second house, and the person with horses must be in the third house.

So, the person who owns horses lives in the third house.

"Let's figure out who lives in which house.

We know there are two houses next to each other, one on the left and one on the right. We also know that each person has a favorite drink, a favorite instrument, a pet, and a favorite book.

From the clues, we know:

1. The cellist lives to the left of the person who likes mystery books.
2. The person who likes history books lives to the left of the person who likes cats.
3. The person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar live next to each other.

Let's start with the last clue. If the person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar live next to each other, they can either live in the left house and the right house, or the right house and the left house.

Now, let's think about the cellist. The cellist lives to the left of the person who likes mystery books. This means the cellist can live in the left house, and the person who likes mystery books can live in the right house.

Now, let's think about the person who likes history books. The person who likes history books lives to the left of the person who likes cats. This means the person who likes history books can live in the left house, and the person who likes cats can live in the right house.

But wait! We already said the cellist can live in the left house, and the person who likes history books can live in the left house. This means the person who likes history books must live in the left house, and the person who likes cats must live in the right house.

Now, let's think about the person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar. They live next to each other, and the person who likes history books lives in the left house. This means the person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar must live in the right house.

So, the person who likes history books lives in the left house, the person who likes cats lives in the right house, the person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar live in the right house, and the cellist lives in the left house.

The only person left is the person who owns horses. Since the person who likes history books lives in the left house, the person who likes cats lives in the right house, and the person who likes root beer and the person who plays the guitar live in the right house, the person who owns horses must live in the left house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have three houses with people in them. Each person has a different pet and a different kind of flowers in their house.

The person with carnations lives to the right of the person with a bird. This means the bird person can't be in the third house because the person with carnations lives to the right of them.

The dog person can't live in the second house. This means the dog person must live in either the first or the third house.

Now, the person with tulips lives to the right of the dog person. If the dog person is in the first house, the person with tulips would be in the second house. If the dog person is in the third house, the person with tulips would be in the fourth house, but there are only three houses, so this can't happen.

So, the dog person must be in the first house, and the person with tulips must be in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

From clue 4, we know the swimmer lives in the fourth house.

From clue 6, we know the person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person with a vase of tulips must live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person with a vase of tulips. Therefore, the person wearing high heels must live in the first house.

From clue 7, we know the person with a phone lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since the person with a vase of tulips lives in the second house, the person with a phone must live in the first house. However, we already know the person wearing high heels lives in the first house.

"Let's figure out where the bird keeper lives.

We know that the person eating mangos lives in the first house.

The person who owns horses doesn't live in the first house.

The bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.

The person eating a banana doesn't live in the third house.

The person who owns horses doesn't live in the second house.

The person eating a banana lives next to the dog owner.

Let's try to put the people in the houses. The person eating mangos is in the first house.

The person eating a banana lives next to the dog owner, so the dog owner must be in the third house. That means the person eating a banana is in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Person eating mangos
- House 2: Person eating a banana
- House 3: Dog owner

The bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other. Since the person eating a banana is in the second house, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in the first and third houses, but we already know the first house is occupied by the person eating mangos. So, the bird keeper must be in the third house, and the person eating kiwis must be in the fourth house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Person eating mangos
- House 2: Person eating a banana
- House 3: Bird keeper
- House 4: Person eating kiwis

The bird keeper lives in the third house. The correct answer is (D)."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know there are three houses with people living in them. Each person likes a different kind of book: mystery, history, or romance. And each person has a different pet: a cat, a bird, or horses.

From clue 1, we know the romance book lover does not live in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.

From clue 4, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house.

So, the first house has a mystery book reader. The second house has a bird keeper, and the third house has a history book buff.

Now, let's think about the pets. We know the person who owns horses does not live in the third house, and the bird keeper lives in the second house. So, the person who owns horses must live in the first house.

But wait, we already know the first house has a mystery book reader! So, the person who owns horses must live in the second house, and the bird keeper must live in the third house.

Now, let's think about the romance book lover. We know they don't live in the third house, and the third house has a history book buff. So, the romance book lover must live in the first or second house.

But we already know the first house has a mystery book reader and the second house has a bird keeper. So, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

We know there are 4 houses, and each house has a person in it. Each person likes a different drink: root beer, coffee, water, or tea. And each person eats a different fruit: mangos, apples, kiwis, or grapes.

We also know some clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person eating apples lives next to the person who only drinks water.
3. The person eating mangos doesn't live in the first house.
4. The person eating mangos doesn't live in the third house.
5. The person eating apples lives to the left of the person who drinks tea.
6. The person eating kiwis doesn't live in the third house.

Let's think about it. If the person eating apples lives next to the person who only drinks water, and the person eating apples lives to the left of the person who drinks tea, then the person eating apples must live in the first house. The person who only drinks water must live in the third house.

Now, let's think about the person eating mangos. They can't live in the first house (Clue 3) or the third house (Clue 4). So, they must live in the fourth house.

The person eating kiwis can't live in the third house (Clue 6), so they must live in the second house. But wait, the coffee drinker lives in the second house (Clue 1). So, the person eating kiwis must live in the second house is not possible. This means the person eating kiwis must live in the first house is not possible because the person eating apples lives in the first house. So the person eating kiwis must live in the third house.

Now, the arrangement is:
1. Person eating apples
2. Coffee drinker
3. Person eating kiwis
4. Person eating mangos

The coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."

From clue 5, we know the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the person who is eating oranges lives in the first house, the golfer must live in the second house. However, we already know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house. Therefore, the golfer must live in the first house, and the person who is eating oranges must be the person who is eating kiwis.

From clue 6, we know the cricketer does not live in the fifth house. Since the person who likes green lives in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house.

"Let's figure out where the person with carnations lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a different person. Each person wears different shoes, likes different books, eats different food, has different flowers, and plays different sports.

From clue 8, we know the soccer player lives in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. Since the soccer player is in the second house, the person with a rose bouquet must be in the first or third house. But clue 3 says the golfer lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet. So, the person with a rose bouquet must be in the first house, and the golfer must be in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person with a rose bouquet is in the first house and the golfer is in the third house, the person who had stew must be in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person who had stew lives to the left of the history book buff. Since the person who had stew is in the second house, the history book buff must be in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the mystery book reader does not live in the second house. Since the history book buff is in the third house, the mystery book reader must be in the first house.

From clue 2, we know there is one house between where the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the golfer is in the third house, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

Now we have the following information:
- House 1: person wearing high heels, mystery book reader, bouquet of daffodils
- House 2: person who had stew, running shoes, soccer player
- House 3: person who ate spaghetti, history book buff, golfer

The only remaining characteristic is the type of shoes the person in the second house is wearing. Since the person in the second house is wearing running shoes, the person in the second house is the soccer player, which is already known. The person in the second house is wearing running shoes, which is the only option left for the person in the second house.

The person in the first house has a bouquet of daffodils, the person in the second house has carnations, and the person in the third house has a rose bouquet.

From clue 7, we know the person who is wearing boots lives to the right of the percussionist.

Let's start with clue 2. The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. This means they can be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.

Now, let's look at clue 5. The person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the person who drives a truck. This means the person who drives a minivan must be in house 3.

Now, let's look at clue 3. The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live next to each other. This means the cellist must be in house 3, and the person who drives a minivan is already in house 3, so the cellist must be in house 3.

Now, let's look at clue 6. The flutist lives to the left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the flutist must be in house 1 or 2.

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person who has a phone lives to the left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the person who has a phone must be in house 1.

Now, let's look at clue 2 again. The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. This means the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2.

From clue 5, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the violinist. But we already know the person who is eating grapes lives in the fifth house, so the person who is eating mangos can't live in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (A) 4."
"Let's figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

We know there are three houses, and each house has a different kind of car: a truck, an SUV, and a minivan. We also know that the person who drives a truck lives to the right of the person who drives a minivan.

Let's start with the minivan. The person with a minivan must live in the first house.

Now, we know the person who drives a truck lives to the right of the person with a minivan. This means the person with a truck lives in the third house.

We also know that the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker. And the person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker. This means the person with an SUV lives in the second house, and the person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

But we also know that the person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house, and the person with a truck lives in the third house. This means the person with a rose bouquet and the person with a truck are the same person. But we already know the person with a truck lives to the right of the person with a minivan, so the person with a truck can't live in the third house. This means our previous assumption was wrong.

Let's try again. We know the person with a minivan lives in the first house. The person with a truck lives to the right of the person with a minivan, so the person with a truck lives in the second house.

Now, we know the person with an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker. And the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker. This means the person with an SUV and the person with a rose bouquet are the same person.

This means the person with a rose bouquet and the person with an SUV must live in the third house.

From clue 13, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.

From clue 12, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house. But we already know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. This means the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who ate spaghetti are the same person. But this is not possible because they have different things. So, we need to ignore clue 12.

From clue 15, the soccer player lives to the right of the baseball player.

From clue 6, the baseball player lives directly left of the tennis player.

From clue 14, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

From clue 10, the person who has a rose bouquet lives to the right of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who drives a truck.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have two houses, one on the left and one on the right. There are two people living in these houses. Each person likes a different color, eats a different fruit, reads a different kind of book, drives a different car, and wears different shoes.

From the clues, we know:
1. The person eating grapes lives next to the person driving a truck.
2. The person wearing boots lives next to the person who likes mystery books.
3. The person who likes yellow lives next to the person driving a truck.

Let's start with clue 1. If the person eating grapes lives next to the person driving a truck, it means the person eating grapes must live in the house on the left, and the person driving a truck must live in the house on the right.

Now, let's look at clue 3. If the person who likes yellow lives next to the person driving a truck, it means the person who likes yellow must live in the house on the left. But we already know the person eating grapes lives in the house on the left. So, the person eating grapes must like yellow.

Now, let's look at clue 2. The person wearing boots lives next to the person who likes mystery books. If the person wearing boots lives next to the person who likes mystery books, it means the person wearing boots must live in the house on the left, and the person who likes mystery books must live in the house on the right.

But we already know the person eating grapes lives in the house on the left and likes yellow. So, the person wearing boots must live in the house on the left, and the person who likes mystery books must live in the house on the right.

Now we have:
- House 1: person who eats grapes, likes yellow, and wears boots
- House 2: person who eats oranges, likes red, and reads mystery books

The only thing left is the car and the book. The person in house 1 must be a fantasy book reader, and the person in house 2 must drive a truck.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

From clue 9, we know the person who likes green lives in the third house.

From clue 12, we know the person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.

From clue 8, we know the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

From clue 7, we know the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 13, we know the romance book lover lives directly left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 1, we know the history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

From clue 3, we know the history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.

From clue 2, there are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the person who had stew lives.

From clue 10, there is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives.

From clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 6, the person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.

From clue 4, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

From clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes blue.

Let's start with the person who likes green in the third house. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader. The romance book lover lives directly left of the mystery book reader. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. There are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the person who had stew lives. There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The person who likes blue lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic. There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes blue.

Let's try to place the person who had stew in the first house. The person who had stew lives in the first house, the mystery book reader must live in the fourth house. The person who drives a convertible must live in the fifth house. The person who ate grilled cheese must live in the third house. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The person who likes blue lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes blue. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the third house.

Now, let's think about the person who ate fried rice. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. So, the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

We know the person in the first house ate spaghetti (clue 10). 

The person in the second house must be the percussionist, as the person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player (clue 9), and the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza (clue 5).

The person in the third house must be the violinist, as the violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other (clue 11), and the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes blue (clue 7).

The person in the fourth house must be the golfer, as the golfer lives in the fourth house (clue 2).

The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover (clue 6). The person who likes white cannot be in the second house, as the percussionist lives in the second house. The person who likes white cannot be in the fourth house, as the golfer lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the first house or the third house.

The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes blue (clue 7). The person who likes green cannot be in the first house, as the person in the first house ate spaghetti. The person who likes green cannot be in the second house, as the percussionist lives in the second house. The person who likes green cannot be in the fourth house, as the golfer lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who likes green must live in the third house, but this is not possible as the violinist lives in the third house. This means the person who likes green must live in the first house, but this is not possible as the person in the first house ate spaghetti.

Let's think about the person who likes blue. The person who likes blue lives next to the violinist (clue 11). The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes blue (clue 7). This means the person who likes green must live in the third house, but this is not possible as the violinist lives in the third house. This means the person who likes green must live in the first house, but this is not possible as the person in the first house ate spaghetti.

The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover (clue 6). The person who likes white cannot be in the second house, as the percussionist lives in the second house. The person who likes white cannot be in the fourth house, as the golfer lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the first house or the third house.

The person who likes green cannot be in the second house, as the percussionist lives in the second house. The person who likes green cannot be in the fourth house, as the golfer lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who likes green must live in the third house, but this is not possible as the violinist lives in the third house. This means the person who likes green must live in the first house, but this is not possible as the person in the first house ate spaghetti.

Let's think about the person who had pizza. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player (clue 9). The person in the second house is the percussionist (from above). The person in the third house is the violinist (from above). The person in the fourth house is the golfer (from above). This means the person who had pizza must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (C) 2."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We have three houses with people living in them. Each person plays a different instrument and a different sport. We need to find out who lives in which house.

We know the following:

1. The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

Since the basketball player and the violinist both live in the second house, we know that the second house is taken by either the basketball player or the violinist. But we also know that they are different people, so one of them must be the basketball player and the other must be the violinist.

Now, let's think about the cellist. The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer, which means the cellist can't live in the second house because the violinist (or basketball player) is already there. So, the cellist must live in the third house.

The only person left is the soccer player. Since the cellist lives in the third house, the soccer player must live in the first house.

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure out where the tea drinker lives.

We know that the person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker (clue 1). This means the person who likes green can't live in the first house because there's no one to the left of the first house.

We also know that the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house (clue 2) and the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house (clue 3). This means the mystery book reader is the same person who only drinks water.

The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live next to each other (clue 10). Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

Now, let's think about the person who has a bouquet of carnations. This person lives to the right of the tea drinker (clue 8). The person who has a bouquet of carnations can't live in the fourth house because the fourth house is already taken by the mystery book reader.

The person who likes red must live in either the first or second house (clue 9). The person who likes green must live in either the first or second house (clue 1).

Let's try to put the people in the houses. If the person who likes red lives in the first house, the person who likes green can't live in the first house because the person who likes green lives to the left of the coffee drinker. This means the person who likes green must live in the second house.

If the person who likes red lives in the second house, the person who likes green can't live in the second house because the person who likes green lives to the left of the coffee drinker. This means the person who likes green must live in the first house.

If the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who likes red must live in the second house. The person who has a bouquet of carnations lives to the right of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker must live in the first house.

The correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"Let's figure out where the fish enthusiast lives.

We know there are four houses, and each house has a different person. The people in these houses have different characteristics: they play different musical instruments, have different pets, like different drinks, and play different sports.

From clue 10, we know the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.

From clue 11, we know the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.

Since the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house, the coffee drinker (flutist) must live in the fourth house. This means the cricketer must live in the third house.

The person who likes milk does not live in the third house (clue 1), so the person who likes milk must live in either the first or second house.

The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other (clue 10), so they must live in either the first or second house.

The dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other (clue 8), so they must live in either the first or second house.

"Let's figure this out.

We have two houses next to each other. One person lives in each house. They all have different things: one person loves cats, one person loves birds, one person has a computer, one person has a gameboy, one person plays the violin, and one person plays the guitar.

We know that the person who plays the violin lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

We also know that the person who has a computer lives to the left of the person who loves birds. Since the person who plays the violin is in house 1, the person with a computer must be in house 1 too. 

Now, let's think about the other house, house number 2. We know the person in house 2 doesn't have a computer or play the violin. They must have a gameboy and play the guitar.

"St. Vitus's Dance is a sickness that makes people move their bodies in weird ways. They can't control it. It's like their body is dancing on its own. If someone has this sickness, they can't dance on purpose like a ballet dancer does. They can't practice or learn ballet moves because their body is doing its own thing. So, they're not likely to win a ballet competition."
"Pig Latin is a fun game where you move the first sound of a word to the end and add ""ay."" For example, ""hello"" becomes ""ellohay."" Pigs can learn to make sounds, so they can learn Pig Latin too."

But a Super Bowl is a really big event, and it needs a lot of seats. The biggest Super Bowl had about 98,179 people, and the average one has around 63,000-70,000 people.

So, the Olympiastadion is not big enough for a Super Bowl crowd."

"If Martin Luther posted 95 theses, we need to know how many days it would take to use them all up. There are 365 days in a year, so half a year would be 365 / 2 = 182.5 days.

Now, let's see how many days it would take to use up 95 theses. We can divide 182.5 by 95.

182.5 ÷ 95 = 1.92

Since 1.92 is more than 1, it would take Martin Luther more than a year to run out of theses. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"Waltz is less injurious than slam dance. 

Waltz is a slow dance where you move your feet in a circle. It's like a big hug with your partner. You don't jump or run around, so you're not likely to get hurt.

Vulcan is a god from Roman mythology. He's the god of fire and volcanoes. He's also the god of blacksmiths, which means he's in charge of making things like tools and swords.

So, Hermes and Vulcan are not the same god. They have different jobs and are from different mythologies."

They might feel happy for a little while, but it's not good for them. It's like eating too much candy and feeling sick later."
"I don't think the Apollos could beat the D'Artagnans. The Apollos are from Greek myths and they are good at music and poetry. They don't seem like they would be good at fighting.

So, the answer is: (A) No"

Don't talk back to the mean people. This can make them get angrier and meaner.

The Isley Brothers were also a family band, but they only had three brothers: O'Kelly, Rudolph, and Ronald. They sang some great songs too, like ""It's Your Thing"" and ""That Lady."" But the Jackson 5 had more brothers and were super famous.

So, I think the Jackson 5 was a bigger family band."
"To make pickles, you don't need lactobacillus. You can just soak cucumbers in a brine solution, like vinegar and salt water. The cucumbers will get all sour and yummy on their own. Some people might use lactobacillus to help the pickling process, but it's not necessary."
"The Wall Street Crash of 1929 was a big problem for many companies. It was like a big storm that made people lose money and be very worried.

Then, Dave and Eve swap gifts. This doesn't change anything for Claire.

Next, Bob and Alice swap gifts. Bob gets Alice's purple gift, and Alice gets Bob's green gift. But we already know Claire has Bob's gift, and now Bob has Alice's purple gift.

Finally, Dave and Bob swap gifts. Dave gets Bob's pink ball, and Bob gets Dave's red gift. But we still don't know what Claire has.

So, let's think about it. Claire got Bob's gift first, and then Bob got Alice's gift. Then, Bob got Eve's gift, and then Bob got Dave's gift. But Claire didn't get any new gifts after the first swap. So, Claire must still have the brown gift.

The correct answer is (D) brown present."

Let's think about it. At the beginning, Claire was dancing with Sam. Then, Claire and Dave switched partners, so Claire was dancing with Dave. Then, Alice and Dave switched partners, so Claire was dancing with Dave (who was dancing with Lola). Then, Bob and Eve switched partners, but that doesn't affect Claire. Finally, Bob and Alice switched partners, so Bob is dancing with Alice, and Alice is dancing with Bob. But we don't know who Dave is dancing with. We know Dave was dancing with Lola, but then he was dancing with Sam, and then he was dancing with Lola again. So, Dave is still dancing with Lola.

So, Claire is dancing with Dave, and Dave is dancing with Lola. But Lola is not an option. Let's look at the other options. We know that Dave is dancing with Lola, but Lola is not an option. We also know that Bob is dancing with Alice, and Eve is dancing with Melissa. But we don't know who Claire is dancing with. We know that Claire was dancing with Sam at the beginning, but then she was dancing with Dave. So, Claire is dancing with Dave, and Dave is dancing with Lola. But Lola is not an option. We also know that Dave was dancing with Sam, but then he was dancing with Lola. So, Claire is dancing with Dave, and Dave is dancing with Lola. But Lola is not an option. We also know that Eve is dancing with Melissa, but that doesn't help us. We also know that Bob is dancing with Alice, but that doesn't help us. We also know that Alice was dancing with Dave, but then she was dancing with Bob. So, Claire is dancing with Dave, and Dave is dancing with Lola. But Lola is not an option.
