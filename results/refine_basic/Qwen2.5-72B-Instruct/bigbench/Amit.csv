"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of the people and their characteristics in the houses.

1. **The flutist lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Flutist

2. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.**
   - This means the person with tulips is in House 1 and the guitarist is in House 2, or the person with tulips is in House 2 and the guitarist is in House 3, or the person with tulips is in House 3 and the guitarist is in House 4.
   - Since the flutist is in House 2, the only possible arrangement is:
     - House 1: Tulips
     - House 2: Flutist
     - House 3: Guitarist

3. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.**
   - This means the person with lilies is in House 1 and the person with carnations is in House 2, or the person with lilies is in House 2 and the person with carnations is in House 3, or the person with lilies is in House 3 and the person with carnations is in House 4.
   - Since the flutist is in House 2 and the guitarist is in House 3, the only possible arrangement is:
     - House 3: Guitarist
     - House 4: Carnations

4. **There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.**
   - The flutist is in House 2, so the pianist must be in House 4 (since there is one house between them).

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 1: Tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Guitarist
- House 4: Carnations, Pianist

The only remaining flower is daffodils, which must be in House 3 (since the guitarist is in House 3).

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Guitarist, Daffodils
- House 4: Carnations, Pianist

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

Therefore, the answer is:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **House 1:**
   - From Clue 9, the person in House 1 is eating apples.

2. **House 3:**
   - From Clue 3, the person in House 3 is wearing high heels.

3. **Truck and SUV:**
   - From Clue 1, the truck driver lives directly left of the SUV owner. This means the truck driver is in House 1, 2, or 3, and the SUV owner is in House 2, 3, or 4, respectively.

4. **Loafers and Convertible:**
   - From Clue 2, the person wearing loafers lives directly left of the person driving a convertible. This means the person wearing loafers is in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person driving a convertible is in House 2, 3, or 4, respectively.

5. **Truck and Fried Rice:**
   - From Clue 6, the truck driver lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the truck driver cannot be in House 4.

6. **Truck and Tea:**
   - From Clue 7, the truck driver lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. This means the tea drinker cannot be in House 4.

7. **Pizza and Coffee:**

### Combining Clues:

- If the pizza eater is in House 2, the mango eater must be in House 1. However, House 1 already has apples, so this is not possible.
- Therefore, the pizza eater must be in House 3, and the mango eater must be in House 2.

- Since the pizza eater is in House 3, the person wearing high heels is in House 3. Therefore, the person in House 3 is the pizza eater and is wearing high heels.

- The person in House 2 is the mango eater. Since the person in House 2 is the mango eater, the person in House 1 must be the apple eater.

- From Clue 7, the tea drinker must be in House 1 or 2. Since the person in House 2 is the mango eater, the tea drinker must be in House 1.

### Final Answer:
The tea drinker lives in House 1.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.**
   - House 1: Not Pizza

3. **Clue 3: The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.**

   - House 5: Water, Grilled Cheese

5. **Clue 5: The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**

   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are in consecutive houses.

Now, let's fill in the information:

- House 5: Water, Grilled Cheese
- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 5, the coffee drinker must be in House 2 (since they live directly left of the person in House 3 who ate spaghetti).

- House 2: Coffee

From Clue 3, the root beer lover must be in House 1 (since they live directly left of the person who had stew, and House 2 is already occupied by the coffee drinker).

- House 1: Root Beer

From Clue 7, the person who had stew must be in House 4 (since they live next to the person who likes milk, and House 2 is already occupied by the coffee drinker).

- House 4: Stew

From Clue 7, the person who likes milk must be in House 5 (since they live next to the person who had stew, and House 5 is the only house left).

- House 5: Milk, Water, Grilled Cheese

Now, we need to determine what the person in House 1 ate for lunch. Since House 1 is the only house left and the only food left is pizza:

- House 1: Root Beer, Pizza

Finally, we need to determine what the person in House 4 drinks. Since House 4 is the only house left and the only drink left is tea:

- House 4: Stew, Tea

So, the final arrangement is:

- House 1: Root Beer, Pizza
- House 2: Coffee
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Stew, Tea

"To solve this problem, let's break down the clues and deduce the characteristics of the people living in each house.

Clues:
1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1:
- The person who drives a convertible must live in house 1, because they live directly left of the history book buff, who must live in house 2.

From Clue 2:
- The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots.

Since the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals.

Thus, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the positions of the people based on their characteristics.

1. **The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.**
   - This means the swimmer and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses, with the swimmer on the left.

2. **The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the basketball player can only be in houses 1, 2, or 3.

3. **The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - This means the mystery book reader and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader on the left.

4. **The swimmer does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the swimmer can only be in houses 1 or 2.

5. **The golfer lives in the first house.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1.

Let's use these clues to fill in the information step by step:

- **House 1: Golfer**
  - The golfer is in house 1.

- **Swimmer and Romance Book Lover:**
  - The swimmer cannot be in house 1 (since the golfer is there) and cannot be in house 3 (clue 4).
  - Therefore, the swimmer must be in house 2.
  - Since the swimmer is in house 2, the romance book lover must be in house 3.

- **Mystery Book Reader and History Book Buff:**
  - The mystery book reader and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader on the left.
  - The only remaining adjacent pair is houses 3 and 4.
  - Therefore, the mystery book reader must be in house 3, and the history book buff must be in house 4.

- **Basketball Player:**
  - The basketball player cannot be in house 4 (clue 2).
  - The basketball player cannot be in house 1 (the golfer is there).

- The person with the computer must be in House 2.
- The person with the phone must be in House 3.

Now, let's use Clue 1:
- The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
Since the person with the gameboy is in House 1, the person who likes green must also be in House 1.

Next, we use Clue 3:
- The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
Since the person who likes green is in House 1, and the person who likes yellow cannot be in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3.

This leaves the person in House 2 to like blue.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Green, Gameboy

"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of the people in the houses based on their preferences.

1. **Clue 1**: There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the coffee drinker cannot be in adjacent houses. They must be separated by exactly two houses.

2. **Clue 2**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in the fourth house, and the coffee drinker cannot be in the first house.

3. **Clue 3**: The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
   - This means the history book buff must be in one of the first three houses.

5. **Clue 5**: The root beer lover lives in the third house.
   - This means the person in the third house drinks root beer.

6. **Clue 6**: The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
   - This means the mystery book reader must be in one of the first three houses.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who likes red lives in the third house.
   - This means the person in the third house likes red.

8. **Clue 8**: The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, with the romance book lover to the left.

9. **Clue 9**: The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
   - This means the tea drinker must be in one of the first, third, or fourth houses.

Let's start filling in the information:

- From Clue 5 and Clue 7, we know:
  - House 3: Red, Root Beer

- From Clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, and the romance book lover must be to the left. Since the romance book lover cannot be in the first house (Clue 4), the possible pairs are:
  - House 2: Romance, House 3: History (but House 3 is already occupied by the root beer lover)
  - House 3: Romance, House 4: History (but House 3 is already occupied by the root beer lover)
  - House 1: Romance, House 2: History

  Therefore, the only possible pair is:
  - House 1: Romance, House 2: History

- From Clue 3, the history book buff cannot be in the fourth house, which is consistent with our current arrangement.

- From Clue 6, the mystery book reader cannot be in the fourth house, so the mystery book reader must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 1 is already the romance book lover, the mystery book reader must be in House 2.

  - House 1: Romance
  - House 2: History, Mystery

- From Clue 9, the tea drinker cannot be in the second house, so the tea drinker must be in House 1 or House 4. Since House 1 is the romance book lover, the tea drinker must be in House 4.

  - House 1: Romance
  - House 2: History, Mystery
  - House 3: Red, Root Beer
  - House 4: Tea

- From Clue 1, there are two houses between the person who likes white and the coffee drinker. The only possible positions for the person who likes white and the coffee drinker are:
  - House 1: White, House 4: Coffee
  - House 4: White, House 1: Coffee

  Since House 1 is the romance book lover, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Romance, Water (since the root beer and coffee are already assigned)
  - House 2: History, Mystery, Green (since the person who likes green must be to the left of the coffee drinker)
  - House 3: Red, Root Beer
  - House 4: White, Coffee, Tea

- From Clue 2, the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green, which is consistent with our current arrangement.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 4.

The answer is: **(B) 4**."

From these clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, likes green, has a phone (since the person in house 2 has a radio), and had spaghetti for lunch (since the person in house 2 had pizza).
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, has a radio, had pizza for lunch.

### Step-by-Step Deduction

1. **Clue 6 and Clue 8**:
   - The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
   - Therefore, the person who had pizza is in house \( n \), the person who ate grilled cheese is in house \( n+1 \), and the person with tulips is in house \( n \) or \( n+1 \).

2. **Clue 1**:
   - The person with the rose bouquet is in house \( n \) and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house \( n+1 \).
   - Therefore, the person with tulips must be in house \( n \).

3. **Clue 4**:
   - The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person with tulips is in house \( n \), the person who had stew must be in house \( n+1 \).

4. **Clue 7**:
   - The person who ate grilled cheese (in house \( n+1 \)) is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house \( n \).

5. **Clue 3 and Clue 5**:
   - The person with tulips is not in house 5.
   - The person with daffodils is not in house 5.
   - Therefore, \( n \) must be 1, 2, 3, or 4.

6. **Clue 10**:
   - The person eating oranges is to the right of the person with carnations.
   - Therefore, the person with carnations must be in a house with a lower number than the person eating oranges.

7. **Clue 9**:
   - There are two houses between the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis.
   - Therefore, if the person eating oranges is in house \( n \), the person eating kiwis is in house \( n+3 \) or \( n-3 \).

8. **Clue 11**:
   - The person eating apples is directly left of the person eating mangos.
   - Therefore, the person eating apples is in house \( n \) and the person eating mangos is in house \( n+1 \).

### Testing Possible Values for \( n \)

  - House 1: Tulips, Pizza
  - House 2: Rose, Grilled Cheese, Stew
  - House 3: Spaghetti

  - This arrangement does not satisfy Clue 9 (two houses between oranges and kiwis).

- If \( n = 2 \):
  - House 1: Carnations
  - House 2: Tulips, Pizza
  - House 3: Rose, Grilled Cheese, Stew
  - House 4: Spaghetti

  - House 1: Carnations
  - House 2: Daffodils
  - House 3: Tulips, Pizza
  - House 4: Rose, Grilled Cheese, Stew
  - House 5: Spaghetti
  - This arrangement does not satisfy Clue 9 (two houses between oranges and kiwis).

  - House 1: Carnations
  - House 2: Daffodils
  - House 3: Oranges
  - House 4: Tulips, Pizza
  - House 5: Rose, Grilled Cheese, Stew
  - This arrangement satisfies all the clues:

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 5.

The answer is \(\boxed{C}\)."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the people and their characteristics in the correct houses.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the person with tulips and the dog owner must be in adjacent houses, with the tulips person on the left.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the daffodils person can only be in houses 1, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - This means the houses with horses and carnations must be separated by one house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means the lilies person must be in a house with a higher number than the horses person.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover is in house 1.

Let's start by placing the cat lover in house 1:

- **House 1:** Cat lover

Now, let's use Clue 1:
- The person with tulips must be directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the person with tulips must be in house 2, and the dog owner must be in house 3.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner

Next, let's use Clue 2:
- The person with daffodils cannot be in house 2. Therefore, the daffodils person must be in house 3 or 4. However, house 3 is already occupied by the dog owner, so the daffodils person must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils

Now, let's use Clue 3:
- There is one house between the person who owns horses and the person with carnations. The only possible arrangement that fits this clue is:
  - Horses in house 1 and carnations in house 3 (not possible because house 3 is the dog owner)
  - Horses in house 2 and carnations in house 4 (not possible because house 2 has tulips and house 4 has daffodils)
  - Horses in house 3 and carnations in house 1 (not possible because house 3 is the dog owner and house 1 is the cat lover)
  - Horses in house 4 and carnations in house 2

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Carnations
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Horses, Daffodils

Now, let's use Clue 4:
- The person with lilies must be to the right of the person with horses. Since the horses are in house 4, the lilies person must be in house 3 or 4. However, house 3 is the dog owner, so the lilies person must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Carnations
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Horses, Daffodils, Lilies

This arrangement is not possible because house 4 cannot have both horses and lilies. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the placement of horses and carnations.

Let's try:
- Horses in house 1 and carnations in house 3

- **House 1:** Horses, Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Carnations, Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils

Now, let's use Clue 4 again:
- The person with lilies must be to the right of the person with horses. Since the horses are in house 1, the lilies person must be in house 2, 3, or 4. However, house 2 has tulips, house 3 has carnations and the dog owner, so the lilies person must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Horses, Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Carnations, Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils, Lilies

Now, we need to place the fish enthusiast. The only house left is house 2, which has tulips.

- **House 1:** Horses, Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips, Fish enthusiast
- **House 3:** Carnations, Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils, Lilies

Therefore, the fish enthusiast lives in house 2.

The answer is: **(A) 2**."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **The person who has a phone lives in the first house.**
   - This means the person in House 1 has a phone.

2. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person in House 1 is wearing boots.

3. **The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio must be in adjacent houses. Since there are only two houses, one of them is in House 1 and the other is in House 2.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Phone

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 1: Boots

Since the person in House 1 has boots, the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

Now, let's determine the pets and devices for each house:
- House 1: Phone, Boots
- House 2: High Heels

From Clue 3, the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other. Since the person in House 1 has a phone, they cannot have a radio. Therefore, the person in House 1 must own horses, and the person in House 2 must have a radio.

So, we have:
- House 1: Phone, Boots, Horses
- House 2: High Heels, Radio

The only pet left is the dog, which must belong to the person in House 2.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Phone, Boots, Horses
- House 2: High Heels, Radio, Dog

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in House 2.

The answer is: (A) 2."

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of the people in the houses based on their sports and pets.

1. **The basketball player does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the basketball player can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

2. **The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.**
   - This means the swimmer cannot live in the first house (since there is no house to the left of the first house).

3. **The baseball player lives in the second house.**
   - This fixes the baseball player in house 2.

4. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.**
   - This means the dog owner cannot live in the fourth house (since there is no house to the right of the fourth house).

5. **The bird keeper does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the bird keeper can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

6. **The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.**
   - This means the tennis player and the cat lover must be in consecutive houses, with the tennis player in the lower-numbered house.

7. **The bird keeper does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the bird keeper can live in houses 2 or 4.

Now, let's piece together the information:

- From clue 3, the baseball player is in house 2.
- From clue 6, the tennis player and the cat lover must be in consecutive houses. Since the baseball player is in house 2, the tennis player and the cat lover must be in houses 1 and 3 or 3 and 4.
- From clue 1, the basketball player cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the tennis player must be in house 1 and the cat lover in house 3.
- From clue 2, the basketball player must be to the left of the swimmer. Since the tennis player is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 3, the basketball player must be in house 2 (baseball player) or house 4. However, the baseball player is already in house 2, so the basketball player must be in house 4.
- This leaves house 1 for the tennis player, house 2 for the baseball player, house 3 for the cat lover, and house 4 for the basketball player.
- From clue 4, the fish enthusiast must be to the right of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in house 3, the dog owner must be in house 1 or 2. However, house 2 is occupied by the baseball player, so the dog owner must be in house 1.
- This leaves house 4 for the fish enthusiast.
- From clue 5 and 7, the bird keeper cannot be in house 1 or 3, and must be in house 4.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 4.

Clues:
1. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is eating kiwis in the first house, as per clue 5:
- House 1: Kiwis

Next, we use clue 3, which states that the person who drives a truck does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person in the first house cannot drive a truck. The only options left for the first house are the SUV or the convertible.

Now, let's use clues 1 and 2:
- Clue 1: The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
- Clue 2: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.

This means that the person in the third house must drive a convertible. So, we have:
- House 3: Convertible

Since the person in the first house cannot drive a truck (clue 3) and the person in the third house drives a convertible, the person in the first house must drive an SUV. Therefore:
- House 1: Kiwis, SUV

Now, we need to determine the car and fruit for the person in the second house. We know:
- The person in the second house cannot drive a truck (since the truck driver cannot be in the first or third house).
- The person in the second house cannot eat a banana (clue 4).

The only options left for the second house are:
- Car: Truck
- Fruit: Mango

So, the person in the second house must be:
- House 2: Mango, Truck

Finally, the person in the third house must be:
- House 3: Banana, Convertible

Summarizing the arrangement:
- House 1: Kiwis, SUV
- House 2: Mango, Truck
- House 3: Banana, Convertible

The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house. Therefore, the answer is:
(A) 1"

   - House 2: Spaghetti

3. **The swimmer lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Swimmer

4. **The cricketer does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the cricketer cannot be in House 3, and the swimmer is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Cricketer

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer, Spaghetti
- House 3: Fried Rice

From this, we can see that the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate spaghetti lives is:

### Filling in the Information:

- **House 1:**
  - Wearing boots (Clue 8)
  - Cannot have daffodils (Clue 7)
  - Cannot have lilies (Clue 5)
  - Therefore, must have carnations
  - Cannot like yellow (Clue 2)

### Answer:
The person who likes green lives in House 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics accordingly:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in House 1 is wearing running shoes.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person in House 3 does not own a sedan.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person in House \( n \) drives a minivan, and the person in House \( n+1 \) is wearing high heels.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the person in House \( m \) is wearing sandals, and the person in House \( m+1 \) drives a convertible.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person in House 1 is wearing running shoes, the person in House 2 must be wearing boots.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the person in House 4 owns an SUV.

Now, let's summarize and place the characteristics:

- **House 1:** Wearing running shoes
- **House 2:** Wearing boots
- **House 4:** Owns an SUV

Using Clue 3, the person who drives a minivan must be in House 3 (since they live directly left of the person in House 4 who is wearing high heels).

Using Clue 4, the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2 (since they live directly left of the person in House 3 who drives a convertible).

However, we already know that the person in House 2 is wearing boots, so the person in House 3 must be wearing high heels and driving a minivan. This means the person in House 4 is driving a convertible.

Now, we have:
- **House 1:** Wearing running shoes
- **House 2:** Wearing boots, driving a minivan
- **House 3:** Wearing high heels
- **House 4:** Driving a convertible, owns an SUV
- **House 5:** Wearing sandals

Since the person in House 4 owns an SUV, the person in House 5 must be wearing sandals and driving a truck (the only remaining car).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing running shoes lives is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"

8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 2:** Wearing running shoes (Clue 7)
- **House 3:** Likes milk (Clue 4)

Now, let's use the other clues to fill in the rest:

### Clue 5: The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
- This means the root beer lover cannot be in House 4 (no house to the right). Therefore, the root beer lover must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
- If the root beer lover is in House 1, the SUV owner must be in House 2.
- If the root beer lover is in House 2, the SUV owner must be in House 3.
- If the root beer lover is in House 3, the SUV owner must be in House 4.

### Clue 1: The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
- If the root beer lover is in House 1, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2.
- If the root beer lover is in House 2, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 1 or 3.
- If the root beer lover is in House 3, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2 or 4.

### Clue 2: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- This means the person wearing loafers cannot be in House 4 (no house to the right). Therefore, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
- If the person wearing loafers is in House 1, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 2.
- If the person wearing loafers is in House 2, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 3.
- If the person wearing loafers is in House 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 4.

### Clue 6: There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
- This means the person who owns a sedan and the person who only drinks water must be in House 1 and House 4, or House 2 and House 4.

### Clue 8: The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
- This means the person who drives a convertible cannot be in House 4 (no house to the right). Therefore, the person who drives a convertible must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
- If the person who drives a convertible is in House 1, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2.
- If the person who drives a convertible is in House 2, the person who only drinks water must be in House 3.
- If the person who drives a convertible is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 4.

### Clue 9: The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.
- This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2, 3, or 4.

Let's combine these clues:

1. **House 2:** Wearing running shoes (Clue 7)
2. **House 3:** Likes milk (Clue 4)

From Clue 5 and Clue 1:
- If the root beer lover is in House 1, the SUV owner must be in House 2, and the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2. This is a contradiction.
- If the root beer lover is in House 2, the SUV owner must be in House 3, and the person who ate fried rice must be in House 1 or 3. This is a contradiction.
- Therefore, the root beer lover must be in House 3, and the SUV owner must be in House 4.

From Clue 1:
- The person who ate fried rice must be in House 2.

From Clue 2:
- The person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 2.

From Clue 6:
- The person who owns a sedan and the person who only drinks water must be in House 1 and House 4, or House 2 and House 4. Since House 2 is already occupied by the person who ate fried rice, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 1, and the person who only drinks water must be in House 4.

From Clue 8:
- The person who drives a convertible must be in House 3, and the person who only drinks water must be in House 4.

From Clue 9:
- The person who ate spaghetti must be in House 4.

Now, let's summarize the arrangement:
- **House 1:** Wearing loafers, owns a sedan
- **House 2:** Wearing running shoes, ate fried rice
- **House 3:** Likes milk, drives a convertible, root beer lover
- **House 4:** Ate grilled cheese, only drinks water, owns an SUV, ate spaghetti

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in **House 1**.

The answer is: **(B) 1**."

   - Since the cellist is in House 3, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 4.
   - House 4: Fried rice

5. **Clue 6**: The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - The person who only drinks water must be in House 1 or 2, and the person wearing loafers must be in House 2 or 3.

   - Therefore, the person who likes milk must be in House 3 or 4.
   - Since the cellist is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 4.
   - House 4: Milk drinker

7. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - The person who had stew cannot be in House 4 (since the person in House 4 drinks milk) or House 3 (since the cellist is in House 3).
   - Therefore, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or 2.
   - Since the person in House 1 drinks water, the person who had stew must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Stew eater

8. **Clue 2**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - The person who had pizza cannot be in House 1 or 2 (since the person in House 2 had stew).
   - Therefore, the person who had pizza must be in House 3 or 4.
   - Since the cellist is in House 3, the person who had pizza must be in House 4.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

9. **Clue 8**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
   - This is consistent with the previous deductions (saxophonist in House 2, pizza eater in House 4).

10. **Clue 9**: The flutist does not live in the fourth house.
    - The flutist must be in House 1 or 3.
    - Since the cellist is in House 3, the flutist must be in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Flutist, Water drinker, Sandals
- House 2: Saxophonist, Stew eater, Loafers
- House 3: Cellist, Fried rice
- House 4: Tea drinker, Milk drinker, Pizza eater

The cellist lives in House 3.

Thus, the answer is:
(C) 3"
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.

1. **Clue 10: The root beer lover lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Root beer lover

2. **Clue 9: The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Minivan driver

   - This means the lilies must be in a house with a higher number than the basketball player.

9. **Clue 2: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the daffodils and lilies must be in consecutive houses.

10. **Clue 1: There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.**
    - This means the coffee drinker and the tennis player must be separated by one house.

Let's start filling in the information:

- House 3: Root beer lover
- House 4: Minivan driver

Since the swimmer does not live in the first house and must be directly left of the sedan owner, the possible pairs for the swimmer and sedan owner are (2, 3) or (3, 4). However, House 3 is already the root beer lover, so the pair must be (2, 3).

- House 2: Swimmer
- House 3: Sedan owner (Root beer lover)

Now, the basketball player and the truck driver must be in consecutive houses, with the basketball player on the left. The only possible pair left is (1, 2) or (2, 3). Since House 2 is the swimmer, the pair must be (1, 2).

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Truck driver

The truck driver lives directly left of the person with carnations, so the person with carnations must be in House 3.

- House 3: Carnations (Sedan owner, Root beer lover)

The person with lilies must be to the right of the basketball player, so the lilies must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 3 already has carnations, the lilies must be in House 4.

- House 4: Lilies (Minivan driver)

The daffodils must be next to the lilies, so the daffodils must be in House 3.

- House 3: Daffodils (Sedan owner, Root beer lover)

Now, we need to place the remaining items:
- House 1: Basketball player, SUV (since the truck is in House 2 and the minivan is in House 4)
- House 2: Truck driver, Carnations
- House 3: Sedan owner, Daffodils, Root beer lover
- House 4: Minivan driver, Lilies

The tennis player must be to the left of the tea drinker, and there is one house between the coffee drinker and the tennis player. The only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Basketball player, SUV, Water (since the root beer is in House 3 and the tea and coffee are not yet placed)
- House 2: Truck driver, Carnations, Coffee
- House 3: Sedan owner, Daffodils, Root beer lover
- House 4: Minivan driver, Lilies, Tea

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in House 2.

   - From Clue 1, the tea drinker lives in House 1.
   - Therefore, House 1: Tea drinker.

2. **House 3:**
   - From Clue 5, the person eating oranges does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person eating oranges must be in House 1 or House 3.
   - Since House 1 is already occupied by the tea drinker, the person eating oranges must be in House 3.
   - Therefore, House 3: Oranges.

3. **House 2:**
   - From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be to the left of the person driving the minivan.
   - Since the person eating oranges is in House 3, the person eating apples must be in House 1 or House 2.
   - If the person eating apples is in House 1, then the person driving the minivan must be in House 2 or House 3. However, House 3 is already occupied by the person eating oranges, so the person driving the minivan must be in House 2.
   - Therefore, House 2: Minivan.

4. **House 3:**
   - From Clue 3, the person driving the convertible must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - Since the person driving the minivan is in House 2, the person driving the convertible must be in House 3.
   - Therefore, House 3: Convertible.

5. **House 1:**
   - From Clue 4, there is one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker.
   - The only possible pairs are (House 1, House 3) or (House 3, House 1).
   - Since the person in House 3 is driving the convertible, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1, and the coffee drinker must be in House 3.
   - Therefore, House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast.

6. **House 2:**
   - The person in House 2 is driving the minivan and not the coffee drinker or the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Therefore, the person in House 2 must be the science fiction book fanatic and eating mangos.
   - Therefore, House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, Mangos.

### Final Arrangement:
- **House 1:** Tea drinker, Fantasy book enthusiast, Apples
- **House 2:** Minivan driver, Science fiction book fanatic, Mangos
- **House 3:** Coffee drinker, Convertible driver, Oranges

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in **House 3**.

--- | --- | ---
? | Red | Mystery

**House 1** | **House 2** | **House 3**
--- | --- | ---
? | Red, Fantasy | Mystery

Using clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

**House 1** | **House 2** | **House 3**
--- | --- | ---
White | Red, Fantasy | Mystery

The only color left is yellow, which must be the favorite color of the person in the third house.

**House 1** | **House 2** | **House 3**
--- | --- | ---
White | Red, Fantasy | Yellow, Mystery

Now, we need to determine the book preference of the person in the first house. Since the second house is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast and the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the person in the first house must be the romance book lover.

**House 1** | **House 2** | **House 3**
--- | --- | ---
White, Romance | Red, Fantasy | Yellow, Mystery

Thus, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

5. **Clue 3: The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.**
   - The person eating a banana is in House 4, so the person eating apples cannot be in House 3 (as per Clue 4). Therefore, the person eating apples must be in House 2, and the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1.

6. **Clue 4: The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.**
   - Confirmed by the previous step.

7. **Clue 5: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**

8. **Clue 6: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.**
   - The person eating apples is in House 2, so the person wearing boots must be in House 4.

Now, let's summarize the information:

- **House 1:**
  - Eating mangos
  - Wearing running shoes
  - Mystery book reader (since the other book types are already assigned)

- **House 2:**
  - Eating apples

   - House 1: Sedan owner, Minivan driver
   - House 2: Water drinker, Daffodils

5. **Clue 8**: The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

    - Fish (x) - Phone (x+1)

12. **Clue 11**: The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.
    - Cat (x) - Dog (x+1)

13. **Clue 16**: The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television.
    - Horses (x) - Television (x+1)

14. **Clue 4**: The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
    - Television < Fried Rice

15. **Clue 14**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
    - Loafers < Gameboy

17. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
    - Spaghetti (x) - Loafers (x+2) or Loafers (x) - Spaghetti (x+2)

Now, let's start filling in the information:

- **House 3**: Yellow
- **House 5**: Grilled Cheese
- **House 4**: Blue
- **House 2**: High Heels
- **House 2**: Not White
- **House 5**: Not Red
- **House 3**: Not Stew
- **House 3**: Not Boots

From Clue 11, the cat lover and dog owner must be in consecutive houses. Since House 3 is Yellow, the cat lover and dog owner cannot be in House 3. Also, the cat lover cannot be in House 5 (Grilled Cheese). Therefore, the cat lover must be in House 1 and the dog owner in House 2.

- **House 1**: Cat Lover
- **House 2**: Dog Owner, High Heels

From Clue 16, the person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television. Since the cat lover is in House 1, the person who owns horses must be in House 1, and the person who has a television must be in House 2. However, this contradicts the dog owner being in House 2. Therefore, the person who owns horses must be in House 2, and the person who has a television must be in House 3.

- **House 2**: Dog Owner, High Heels, Horses
- **House 3**: Yellow, Television

From Clue 4, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 4 or House 5.

- **House 4**: Blue, Fried Rice
- **House 5**: Grilled Cheese

From Clue 14, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers. Since the person who has a gameboy cannot be in House 1 (cat lover) or House 2 (dog owner), the person who has a gameboy must be in House 4 or House 5. Since the person who ate fried rice is in House 4, the person who has a gameboy must be in House 5.

- **House 5**: Grilled Cheese, Gameboy

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

- **House 1**: Cat Lover, Sandals
- **House 2**: Dog Owner, High Heels, Horses
- **House 3**: Yellow, Television
- **House 4**: Blue, Fried Rice
- **House 5**: Grilled Cheese, Gameboy

From Clue 7, there is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. Since the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in House 5 (Grilled Cheese) or House 4 (Fried Rice), the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 1, 2, or 3. The person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in House 5 (Gameboy) or House 4 (Fried Rice), the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- **House 1**: Cat Lover, Sandals, Spaghetti
- **House 2**: Dog Owner, High Heels, Horses
- **House 3**: Yellow, Television, Loafers
- **House 4**: Blue, Fried Rice
- **House 5**: Grilled Cheese, Gameboy

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing loafers lives is **3**.

The answer is: **(D) 3**."
"To solve this, let's break down the clues:

1. The person with the lilies does not live in the first house. This means the lilies are in the second house.
2. The person with the television lives in the first house. This means the first house has a television.

Since the first house has a television, the second house must have the computer. Therefore, the person with the computer lives in house number 2.

The answer is:

"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the characteristics of the people living in each house.

### Clues:
1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.**
   - Since there are only two houses, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1, and the golfer must live in house 2.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.**
   - This means one person had pizza and the other is a history book buff. Since the houses are next to each other, one of these characteristics must belong to the person in house 1, and the other to the person in house 2.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - The person with the bouquet of daffodils must live in house 1, because there is no house to the right of house 2. Therefore, the guitarist must live in house 2.

### Combining the Clues:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic, bouquet of daffodils.
- House 2: Golfer, guitarist.

### Determining the Remaining Characteristics:
- Since the person in house 1 is the science fiction book fanatic and has a bouquet of daffodils, the person in house 2 must be the history book buff.
- From Clue 2, the person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other. Since the history book buff is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 1.
- Therefore, the person in house 1 had pizza, and the person in house 2 had spaghetti.

### Final Assignment:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic, bouquet of daffodils, had pizza.
- House 2: History book buff, golfer, guitarist, had spaghetti.

### Conclusion:
The percussionist must live in house 1, as the only remaining characteristic for house 1 is the percussionist.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is:
**Answer: (B) 1**"

9. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who owns horses lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The bird keeper lives in the fifth house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 4:** Violinist (Clue 8)
- **House 5:** Bird keeper (Clue 10)

Next, we use Clue 7:
- The person with the television must be in House 3, and the person with the gameboy must be in House 4.

Now, we use Clue 4:
- The flutist must be in House 2 (since the person with the television is in House 3).

Next, we use Clue 5:
- The person with the radio must be in House 5 (since the person with the television is in House 3).

Now, we use Clue 1:
- The guitarist must be in House 5 (since the person with the gameboy is in House 4).

Next, we use Clue 6:
- The percussionist must be in House 3 (since the guitarist is in House 5).

Now, we use Clue 9:
- The person with the phone must be in House 1 (since there are two houses between the person with the phone and the person who owns horses, and the person who owns horses must be in House 4).

Now, we use Clue 3:
- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the person who owns horses must be in House 4.

Now, we use Clue 2:
- The dog owner cannot be in House 2, so the dog owner must be in House 1.

Finally, we need to place the remaining pet and instrument:
- The cat lover must be in House 2 (since the only remaining pet is a cat).
- The remaining instrument for House 1 is the percussionist, but we already placed the percussionist in House 3, so the remaining instrument for House 1 is the pianist.

So, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **3**.

The answer is: **(A) 3**."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the person with the radio cannot be in the first house, and the person eating apples cannot be in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - This means the person with the radio cannot be in the first house, and the violinist cannot be in the second house.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in the first house has lilies, and the person in the second house has roses.

4. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player must live in the second house.

From Clue 3, we know:
- House 1: Lilies
- House 2: Roses

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Not a basketball player
- House 2: Basketball player

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we know:
- The person with the radio must be in the second house (since they must be to the right of both the person eating apples and the violinist).

Since the person with the radio is in the second house, the person in the first house must have the computer.

Now, let's determine the fruits:
- The person with the radio (in the second house) cannot be eating apples (Clue 1), so they must be eating oranges.
- Therefore, the person in the first house must be eating apples.

Now, let's determine the musical instruments:
- The person with the radio (in the second house) cannot be the violinist (Clue 2), so they must be the pianist.
- Therefore, the person in the first house must be the violinist.

So, the violinist lives in the first house.

The answer is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of the people in the houses based on their sports and what they ate for lunch.

   - House 5: Grilled cheese

3. **The golfer lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Golfer

4. **There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)
   - Since the tennis player is in house 3, the pair (1, 3) is not possible.
   - Since the golfer is in house 4, the pair (2, 4) is not possible.
   - Therefore, the pair must be (3, 5).

5. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.**
   - This means the cricketer cannot be in house 1.

6. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 5, the person who had stew must be in house 4.

7. **The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.**
   - The tennis player is in house 3, so the soccer player must be in house 4 or 5.
   - Since the golfer is in house 4, the soccer player must be in house 5.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Unknown
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Golfer, Stew
- House 5: Soccer player, Grilled cheese, Spaghetti

From clue 4, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 1 (since the only remaining house is 1).

From clue 5, the person who had pizza must be in house 2 (since the only remaining house is 2).

Now, we need to determine the sport of the person in house 2:
- House 1: Fried rice, Basketball player (since the only remaining sport is basketball)
- House 2: Pizza, Cricketer (since the only remaining sport is cricket)

Thus, the cricketer lives in house 2.

The answer is: **(B) 2**."

   - Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, the baseball player must live in the first house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, the person who only drinks water must live in the first house.

- **House 1:**
  - Wears loafers (since the person in House 2 wears running shoes)
  - Likes white
  - Baseball player
  - Drinks water
  - Ate stew (since the person in House 2 ate spaghetti)

"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of the people in the houses based on their characteristics.

### Clues:
1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3: The root beer lover does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the root beer lover can only live in house 1 or house 3.

2. **Clue 4: The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person eating oranges can only live in house 1 or house 3.

3. **Clue 2: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.**
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 3, because there would be no house to the right of house 3 for the water drinker.
   - Therefore, the root beer lover must be in house 1.

4. **Clue 1: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.**
   - Since the root beer lover is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (the only house to the left of house 3).

5. **Remaining Assignments:**
   - The person in house 1 (root beer lover) must be eating oranges (since they cannot be eating mangos and the only other option is oranges).
   - The person in house 2 (coffee drinker) must be eating grapes (since they cannot be eating oranges or mangos).
   - The person in house 3 (water drinker) must be eating mangos.

### Final Arrangement:

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

Let's start with Clue 3:
- House 1: Spaghetti

From Clue 1, the person who ate fried rice cannot be in the second house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must be in either the first or the third house. Since the first house is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house:
- House 3: Fried Rice

Now, using Clue 2, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the third house, the person wearing boots must be in the second house:
- House 2: Boots

From Clue 4, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, and the second house is occupied by the person wearing boots, the person wearing loafers must be in the third house:
- House 3: Fried Rice, Loafers

The only remaining option for the person in the second house is that they are wearing running shoes:
- House 2: Boots, Running Shoes

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Spaghetti, Running Shoes
- House 2: Pizza, Boots
- House 3: Fried Rice, Loafers

Let's start filling in the information:

- **House 1**: Running shoes (Clue 13)
- **House 3**: Boots (Clue 17)
- **House 4**: Swimmer (Clue 7)

From Clue 6 and Clue 9:
- The person wearing loafers is directly left of the person with carnations.
- The person wearing loafers is directly left of the person who owns horses.

This means the person wearing loafers and the person with carnations must be in consecutive houses, and the person with horses must be in the house immediately to the right of the person wearing loafers. Since the person in House 3 has boots, the person wearing loafers cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the person wearing loafers must be in House 2, and the person with carnations must be in House 3. This also means the person with horses is in House 3.

- **House 2**: Loafers
- **House 3**: Boots, Carnations, Horses

From Clue 12:
- The dog owner lives directly left of the person with tulips. Since the person in House 2 is wearing loafers, the dog owner cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the dog owner must be in House 1, and the person with tulips must be in House 2.

- **House 1**: Running shoes, Dog owner, Tulips
- **House 2**: Loafers, Tulips
- **House 3**: Boots, Carnations, Horses

From Clue 16:
- The person with a phone lives directly left of the person with a rose bouquet. Since the person in House 2 is wearing loafers, the person with a phone cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the person with a phone must be in House 1, and the person with a rose bouquet must be in House 2.

- **House 1**: Running shoes, Dog owner, Tulips, Phone
- **House 2**: Loafers, Tulips, Rose bouquet
- **House 3**: Boots, Carnations, Horses

- **House 2**: Loafers, Tulips, Rose bouquet
- **House 3**: Boots, Carnations, Horses

From Clue 18:
- The tennis player lives to the left of the person with a gameboy. Since the tennis player is in House 1, the person with a gameboy must be in House 2 or House 3. Since House 3 already has boots, carnations, and horses, the person with a gameboy must be in House 2.

- **House 1**: Running shoes, Dog owner, Tulips, Phone, Tennis player
- **House 2**: Loafers, Tulips, Rose bouquet, Gameboy
- **House 3**: Boots, Carnations, Horses

From Clue 10:
- The person with a phone lives to the left of the person with a radio. Since the person with a phone is in House 1, the person with a radio must be in House 2 or House 3. Since House 2 already has a gameboy, the person with a radio must be in House 3.

- **House 1**: Running shoes, Dog owner, Tulips, Phone, Tennis player
- **House 2**: Loafers, Tulips, Rose bouquet, Gameboy
- **House 3**: Boots, Carnations, Horses, Radio

From Clue 11:
- The cat lover lives to the left of the soccer player. Since the person in House 3 has boots, carnations, horses, and a radio, the cat lover cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the cat lover must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 1 already has a dog owner, the cat lover must be in House 2, and the soccer player must be in House 3.

- **House 1**: Running shoes, Dog owner, Tulips, Phone, Tennis player
- **House 2**: Loafers, Tulips, Rose bouquet, Gameboy, Cat lover
- **House 3**: Boots, Carnations, Horses, Radio, Soccer player

From Clue 3:

- **House 2**: Loafers, Tulips, Rose bouquet, Gameboy, Cat lover
- **House 3**: Boots, Carnations, Horses, Radio, Soccer player

- **House 2**: Loafers, Tulips, Rose bouquet, Gameboy, Cat lover
- **House 3**: Boots, Carnations, Horses, Radio, Soccer player
- **House 4**: Swimmer
- **House 5**: Bird keeper

From Clue 8:
- The person with lilies lives to the right of the basketball player. Since the person in House 1 is a tennis player and the person in House 2 is a cat lover, the basketball player must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 1 already has a tennis player, the basketball player must be in House 2. Therefore, the person with lilies must be in House 3 or House 4. Since House 3 already has carnations, the person with lilies must be in House 4.

- **House 1**: Running shoes, Dog owner, Tulips, Phone, Tennis player, Fish enthusiast
- **House 2**: Loafers, Tulips, Rose bouquet, Gameboy, Cat lover, Basketball player

- House 1: Person eating apples, likes green
- House 2: Person eating oranges, likes blue
- House 3: Person eating kiwis, likes white

The answer is: **(A) 3**."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement:

1. **Clue 1: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**

2. **Clue 2: The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.**
   - Since there are only two houses, the soccer player must be in house 1 and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.**
   - Since the mystery book reader is in house 2, the person with the gameboy must be in house 1.

From these deductions:
- House 1: Rose bouquet, soccer player, gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader

Since the root beer lover must be to the right of the person with the rose bouquet (Clue 1), the root beer lover must be in house 2. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in house 1.

To summarize:
- **House 1**: Rose bouquet, soccer player, gameboy, coffee drinker
- **House 2**: Mystery book reader, root beer lover

Thus, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1.

3. **The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.**

However, from clue 3, the truck driver must be directly left of the sedan owner, so the only possible pairs are (1, 2), (2, 3), or (3, 4). Therefore, the only possible pair that fits both clues is (1, 4).

- So, the truck driver lives in house 1, and the dog owner lives in house 4.

- From clue 4, the fish enthusiast must live directly left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in house 4, the fish enthusiast must be in house 3.

- From clue 1, the person who drives a minivan must live to the right of the fish enthusiast. Since the fish enthusiast is in house 3, the minivan driver must be in house 4. However, house 4 is already occupied by the dog owner, so the minivan driver must be in house 2.

- From clue 3, the truck driver (house 1) is directly left of the sedan owner. Since the minivan driver is in house 2, the sedan owner must be in house 3.

- The only house left is house 2, which must be the horse owner. The only car left is the SUV, so the horse owner must drive an SUV.

- The cat lover cannot live in house 2 (clue 5), so the cat lover must live in house 1.

Summarizing the results:
- House 1: Cat lover, truck driver
- House 2: Horse owner, minivan driver
- House 3: Fish enthusiast, sedan owner
- House 4: Dog owner, SUV driver

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 4.

The answer is: **(A) 4**."
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze each clue and place the people in the houses accordingly:

1. **Clue 5: The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Yellow

2. **Clue 1: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.**
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes blue must be in House 4.

3. **Clue 2: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.**
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 4.

4. **Clue 3: The root beer lover lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Root beer

5. **Clue 4: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.**
   - The only remaining houses are House 1 and House 2 for the person who only drinks water, and House 4 for the person who likes white (since House 3 is already occupied by the person who likes yellow).

   - Since the root beer lover is in House 2, the person who only drinks water must be in House 1.
   - Therefore, the person who likes white must be in House 4.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Water
- House 2: Root beer
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: White, Milk, Blue

Since the person who likes blue must be in House 4 (from Clue 1 and the fact that House 3 is occupied by the person who likes yellow), the person who likes blue lives in House 4.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who likes blue lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.**
   - This means the cellist must be in house 1, and the person with the gameboy must be in house 2.

2. **The dog owner does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the dog owner must be in house 2.

Now, let's summarize the information:

- **House 1:**
  - The cellist
  - The person with the computer (since the person with the gameboy is in house 2)
  - The fish enthusiast (since the dog owner is in house 2)

- **House 2:**
  - The guitarist
  - The person with the gameboy
  - The dog owner

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is: **(B) 2**."
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of people, their cars, and their devices in the four houses.

- The person with the phone must be directly left of the person with the SUV. Since the gameboy is in House 3, the phone and SUV must be in Houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. However, House 3 already has the gameboy, so the phone and SUV must be in Houses 1 and 2.
  - House 1: Minivan, Phone
  - House 2: SUV

- The person with the computer cannot be in House 1, so the computer must be in House 2, 3, or 4. Since House 3 has the gameboy and House 4 has the radio, the computer must be in House 2.
  - House 2: SUV, Computer

- The person with the convertible cannot be in House 3, so the convertible must be in House 1, 2, or 4. Since House 1 has the minivan and House 2 has the SUV, the convertible must be in House 4.

   - This means one person has a radio and the other drives a truck, and they must be in adjacent houses.

2. **The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.**
   - This means the person with the radio cannot be in house 2, because there is no house to the right of house 2. Therefore, the person with the radio must be in house 1, and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

3. **The root beer lover does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the root beer lover must live in house 2.

4. **The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
   - This means the person eating grapes must be in house 1, and the person with the computer must be in house 2.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- **House 1**: Person with the radio, eating grapes.
- **House 2**: Person with the computer, root beer lover.

From clue 1, since the person with the radio is in house 1 and they live next to each other, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1. Therefore, the person in house 2 must drive a minivan.

From clue 3, the root beer lover is in house 2, so the person in house 1 must drink water.

From clue 4, the person in house 1 is eating grapes, and the person in house 2 has a computer.

We also know from clue 2 that the person who had pizza is in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- **House 1**: Person with the radio, eating grapes, drinking water, and driving a truck.
- **House 2**: Person with the computer, root beer lover, eating bananas, and driving a minivan, and had pizza for lunch.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The answer is: **(A) 2**."

   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **House 2: Pizza eater**
   - From Clue 5, the tea drinker (House 1) lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - House 2: Pizza eater

3. **House 3 and House 4: White liker and Water drinker**
   - From Clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since House 2 is occupied by the pizza eater, the white liker and water drinker must be in Houses 3 and 4.
   - House 3: White liker or Water drinker
   - House 4: Water drinker or White liker

4. **House 3: Spaghetti eater**
   - From Clue 6, the spaghetti eater must be to the left of the water drinker. Since House 2 is the pizza eater, the spaghetti eater must be in House 3.
   - House 3: Spaghetti eater
   - House 4: Water drinker

5. **House 1: Tea drinker (Milk drinker)**
   - From Clue 2, the milk drinker must be to the left of the spaghetti eater. Since House 1 is the tea drinker and House 2 is the pizza eater, the milk drinker must be in House 1.
   - House 1: Tea drinker (Milk drinker)

6. **House 2: Pizza eater (Yellow liker)**
   - From Clue 3, the coffee drinker must be to the left of the yellow liker. Since House 1 is the tea drinker and milk drinker, the yellow liker must be in House 2.

   - House 3: Spaghetti eater (White liker)

8. **House 4: Water drinker (Green liker)**
   - From Clue 7, the green liker cannot be in House 1. Since House 1 is the tea drinker and milk drinker, and House 2 is the pizza eater and yellow liker, and House 3 is the spaghetti eater and white liker, the green liker must be in House 4.
   - House 4: Water drinker (Green liker)

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Tea drinker (Milk drinker)
- House 2: Pizza eater (Yellow liker)
- House 3: Spaghetti eater (White liker)
- House 4: Water drinker (Green liker)

The person who likes green lives in House 4.

   - Let's denote the house where the person who likes red as \( R \) and the house where the person who owns an SUV as \( S \).
   - Possible pairs: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (4, 2)
   - Since the dog owner (House 3) likes white, \( R \) cannot be 3.
   - Since the horse owner (House 4) is not red, \( R \) cannot be 4.
   - Therefore, \( R \) must be 1 or 2.
   - If \( R = 1 \), then \( S = 3 \) (but House 3 is already occupied by the dog owner).
   - If \( R = 2 \), then \( S = 4 \).

8. **Clue 5: There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.**
   - Let's denote the house where the person who likes milk as \( M \) and the house where the person who owns a sedan as \( D \).
   - Possible pairs: (1, 4), (4, 1)
   - Since the horse owner (House 4) is not the milk drinker, \( M \) cannot be 4.
   - Therefore, \( M = 1 \) and \( D = 4 \).

9. **Clue 6: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - Let's denote the house where the person who drives a minivan as \( V \) and the house where the person who wears sandals as \( Sd \).
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)
   - Since the dog owner (House 3) is not wearing sandals, \( Sd \) cannot be 3.
   - Since the horse owner (House 4) is not wearing sandals, \( Sd \) cannot be 4.
   - Therefore, \( V = 1 \) and \( Sd = 2 \).

10. **Clue 7: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.**
    - Since the person in House 1 is the fish enthusiast and drives a minivan, they cannot be wearing loafers.
    - Therefore, the person in House 2 must be wearing loafers.

11. **Clue 9: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.**
    - The root beer lover must be in House 1 or 2.
    - The coffee drinker must be in House 2 or 3.
    - Since the person in House 2 is wearing loafers, they cannot be the coffee drinker.
    - Therefore, the root beer lover is in House 1, and the coffee drinker is in House 2.

12. **Clue 10: The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.**
    - The person in House 1 is the fish enthusiast and drives a minivan, so they cannot be wearing high heels.
    - The person in House 2 is wearing loafers, so they cannot be wearing high heels.
    - Therefore, the person in House 1 must be wearing high heels.

13. **Clue 11: The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.**
    - The person in House 2 is wearing loafers, and the person in House 4 owns an SUV.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast, wears high heels, drives a minivan, likes milk, root beer lover
- House 2: Wears loafers, likes red, coffee drinker, wears sandals
- House 3: Dog owner, likes white, water drinker, SUV owner
- House 4: Horse owner, wears sandals, drives a sedan, likes water

The person who likes red lives in House 2.

"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of the people in the houses based on their sports, lunch, and flowers.

1. **The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in the third house, and the basketball player cannot be in the first house. The possible pairs are:
     - Golfer in house 1, basketball player in house 2
     - Golfer in house 2, basketball player in house 3

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - This means the person with lilies cannot be in the third house, and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in the first house. The possible pairs are:
     - Lilies in house 1, grilled cheese in house 2
     - Lilies in house 2, grilled cheese in house 3

3. **The soccer player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the third house is occupied by the soccer player. Therefore, the golfer and the basketball player must be in houses 1 and 2, respectively.

4. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in the third house, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the first house. Given the soccer player is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2 or 3.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the person with tulips must be in house 1 or 2.

Now, let's combine all the information:

- The soccer player is in house 3.
- The golfer must be in house 1, and the basketball player must be in house 2 (from clue 1).
- The person with lilies must be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (from clue 2, and the fact that the soccer player is in house 3).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Golfer, lilies
- House 2: Basketball player, grilled cheese
- House 3: Soccer player, spaghetti

To confirm:
- The golfer (house 1) is directly left of the basketball player (house 2).
- The person with lilies (house 1) is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese (house 2).
- The soccer player is in house 3.
- The person who ate grilled cheese (house 2) is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (house 3).
- The person with tulips is in house 2, and the person with daffodils is in house 1.

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2.

The answer is: **(B) 2**."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Spaghetti

2. **Clue 3**: The pianist lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Pianist

3. **Clue 9**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Pianist, Fried Rice

4. **Clue 7**: The person who likes red lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Pianist, Fried Rice, Red

5. **Clue 10**: The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other.
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

6. **Clue 11**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)

7. **Clue 6**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

8. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means the person who likes yellow cannot be in the fifth house.

9. **Clue 5**: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Spaghetti, Not Green

10. **Clue 1**: The saxophonist does not live in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Not Saxophonist

11. **Clue 4**: The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
    - Since the pianist is in House 3, the percussionist must be in House 1 or 2.

12. **Clue 8**: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
    - Possible pairs: (1, 4), (2, 5)

Let's start filling in the information:

- House 3: Pianist, Fried Rice, Red
- House 4: Spaghetti, Not Green

Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in House 5 (Clue 12), and there are two houses between the person who likes yellow and the person who likes white (Clue 8), the only possible pairs are (1, 4) and (2, 5).

- If the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must be in House 4.
- If the person who likes yellow is in House 2, the person who likes white must be in House 5.

Since House 4 already has Spaghetti and cannot be Green, the person who likes yellow cannot be in House 1 (as House 4 would then be white, which is not possible).

Therefore, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2, and the person who likes white must be in House 5.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 5: White

Now, the person who had stew must be in House 1 (since they live directly left of the person who likes yellow in House 2).

- House 1: Stew, Yellow

The percussionist and the cellist must be in Houses 1 and 2, but since the person in House 2 likes yellow, the percussionist must be in House 1 and the cellist in House 2.

- House 1: Stew, Yellow, Percussionist
- House 2: Yellow, Cellist

The person who had pizza must be in House 5 (since they live to the right of the person who likes yellow in House 2).

- House 5: White, Pizza

The only house left is House 4, which has Spaghetti and must be Green (since it cannot be Red, Yellow, or White).

- House 4: Spaghetti, Green

The only person left is the saxophonist, who must be in House 5.

- House 5: White, Pizza, Saxophonist

Summarizing the final arrangement:
- House 1: Stew, Yellow, Percussionist
- House 2: Yellow, Cellist
- House 3: Pianist, Fried Rice, Red
- House 4: Spaghetti, Green
- House 5: White, Pizza, Saxophonist

The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

Thus, the answer is:
\boxed{D}"

3. **Sandals < Root beer**
   - Sandals cannot be in House 4 (since Root beer must be to the right of Sandals).

4. **Grilled cheese < Water**
   - Grilled cheese cannot be in House 4 (since Water must be to the right of Grilled cheese).

- If Stew is in House 3, then Spaghetti must be in House 4.
- If Stew is in House 2, then Spaghetti can be in House 3 or 4.
- If Stew is in House 1, then Spaghetti can be in House 2, 3, or 4.

Since House 3 is the tea drinker, Stew cannot be in House 3. Therefore, Stew must be in House 1 or 2.

### Testing Stew in House 2:
- If Stew is in House 2, then Spaghetti must be in House 4.
- Running shoes must be in House 1 (since Running shoes < Stew).

Now, let's check the other clues:
- **Sandals < Root beer**
  - Sandals can be in House 1, 2, or 3.
  - If Sandals is in House 1, then Root beer can be in House 2, 3, or 4.
  - If Sandals is in House 2, then Root beer can be in House 3 or 4.
  - If Sandals is in House 3, then Root beer must be in House 4.

- **High heels and Water are adjacent**
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

- **Grilled cheese ≠ House 1**

Let's test the possible positions for Grilled cheese and Water:

  - If Water is in House 3, then High heels must be in House 2 (but Grilled cheese is already in House 2, so this is not possible).
  - If Water is in House 4, then High heels must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the tea drinker, so this is not possible).

- If Grilled cheese is in House 3, then Water must be in House 4.
  - This means High heels must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the tea drinker, so this is not possible).

### Testing Stew in House 1:
- If Stew is in House 1, then Spaghetti can be in House 2, 3, or 4.
- Running shoes must be in House 1 (since Running shoes < Stew).

Now, let's check the other clues:
- **Sandals < Root beer**
  - Sandals can be in House 1, 2, or 3.
  - If Sandals is in House 1, then Root beer can be in House 2, 3, or 4.
  - If Sandals is in House 2, then Root beer can be in House 3 or 4.

  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

- **Grilled cheese ≠ House 1**

Let's test the possible positions for Grilled cheese and Water:
- If Grilled cheese is in House 2, then Water must be in House 3 or 4.
  - If Water is in House 3, then High heels must be in House 2 (but Grilled cheese is already in House 2, so this is not possible).
  - If Water is in House 4, then High heels must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the tea drinker, so this is not possible).

- If Grilled cheese is in House 3, then Water must be in House 4.
  - This means High heels must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the tea drinker, so this is not possible).

### Correct Arrangement:
- **House 1: Running shoes, Sandals, Grilled cheese**
- **House 2: Stew, High heels**
- **House 3: Tea drinker, Water**
- **House 4: Spaghetti, Root beer**

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in **House 1**.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 3**: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers (Clues 5, 11, 12)
- **House 4**: Basketball player (Clue 6)

Now, let's use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the cricketer (House 3) has loafers, the person with boots must be in House 2, and the person with the computer must be in House 3.
- **Clue 8**: The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. Since the computer is in House 3, the soccer player must be in House 2.

- **Clue 1**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the person who likes milk is in House 2, the tea drinker must be in House 1.
- **Clue 3**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house. Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the root beer lover must be in House 4.
- **Clue 9**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the root beer lover is in House 4, the person who has a radio (House 3) is to the right of the root beer lover.

From Clue 4, we know the person with the computer is in House 3.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a computer lives is **(C) 3**."
"To solve this, let's carefully analyze the given information and the clue provided:

- There are two houses, numbered 1 (left) and 2 (right).
- Each house has one person living in it.
- One person ate pizza, and the other ate fried rice.
- One person is a science fiction book fanatic, and the other is a history book buff.
- The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Let's break it down:

1. **House 1 (left) and House 2 (right):**
   - House 1 is on the left.
   - House 2 is on the right.

2. **Clue Analysis:**
   - The person who ate fried rice must live in a house to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - Since there are only two houses, the only way for the person who ate fried rice to be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic is if the science fiction book fanatic lives in House 1 and the person who ate fried rice lives in House 2.

3. **Determine the Science Fiction Book Fanatic's House:**
   - If the science fiction book fanatic lives in House 1, then the person who ate fried rice must live in House 2.
   - This arrangement satisfies the clue that the person who ate fried rice is to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in House 1.

The answer is:
(B) 1"
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **The pianist lives in the first house.**
   - This means the person in House 1 is a pianist.

2. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - Since House 2 is the only house to the right of House 1, the person who owns horses must be in House 1, and the root beer lover must be in House 2.

3. **The person who likes white does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person who likes white must be in House 1.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- House 1: Pianist, owns horses, likes white.
- House 2: Root beer lover.

Next, we need to determine the remaining characteristics for each house:
- Since the person in House 1 owns horses, the person in House 2 must own the dog.
- The person in House 1 likes white, so the person in House 2 must like blue.
- The person in House 1 is a pianist, so the person in House 2 must be a violinist.

So, the final characteristics are:
- House 1: Pianist, owns horses, likes white, drinks water.
- House 2: Violinist, owns dog, likes blue, drinks root beer.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in House 2.

The answer is: **(B) 2**."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the clues and deduce the positions step by step:

1. **Clue 2: The person who had stew lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Stew

2. **Clue 7: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Pizza

3. **Clue 5: There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.**
   - If the person who ate fried rice is in House 1, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 4.
   - If the person who ate fried rice is in House 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1.
   - Since House 4 is already occupied by the person who had pizza, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 1, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 4.
   - House 1: Fried Rice
   - House 4: Pizza, Fantasy Book Enthusiast

4. **Clue 1: The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
   - The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 4 (since the fantasy book enthusiast is there), so the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
   - The percussionist must be in House 2, 3, or 4.

5. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.**
   - The violinist cannot be in House 1 (since the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist).
   - The violinist cannot be in House 4 (since the fantasy book enthusiast is there).
   - Therefore, the violinist must be in House 2 or 3.
   - The guitarist must be in House 1 or 2.

6. **Clue 4: The violinist does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This is already satisfied by the previous deductions.

7. **Clue 6: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.**
   - The percussionist cannot be in House 4 (since the history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist).
   - Therefore, the percussionist must be in House 2 or 3.

Now, let's combine all the information:

- House 1: Fried Rice, Guitarist (since the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist and the only left option is House 1)
- House 2: Stew, Violinist (since the violinist cannot be in House 4 and must be to the right of the guitarist)
- House 3: (must be the percussionist, as the only remaining option for the percussionist)
- House 4: Pizza, Fantasy Book Enthusiast

Finally, we need to place the science fiction book fanatic and the history book buff:

- The science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 (since the percussionist is in House 3 and the science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist).
- The history book buff must be in House 4 (since the history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist).

Thus, the percussionist lives in House 3.

The answer is: **(B) 3**."

Now, the only house left for the person who is eating oranges is the first house:
- House 1: Oranges
- House 2: Mangos
- House 3: Apples

Using clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker cannot be in the second house (clue 3), the coffee drinker must be in the first house, and the person who likes milk must be in the second house:

- House 3: Apples

The only drink left is root beer, which must be the favorite drink of the person in the third house:

- The person who likes green must be in the first house (since they are to the left of the history book buff, and the first house is the only option left).

- The person who had pizza cannot be in the first house, so they must be in the second or third house. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the person who had pizza must be in the third house.

- The person who ate fried rice must be to the right of the romance book lover, so they must be in the third house. However, the person who had pizza is already in the third house, so the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

Now, let's summarize the final arrangement:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow, ate grilled cheese.

- House 4: Cricketer, Running shoes
- House 5: Daffodils

From clue 3, the person with sandals must be in house 3 (since the swimmer is in house 3 and the person with tulips must be in house 4).

- House 3: Swimmer, Sandals

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.**
   - This means the person in House 1 is wearing high heels, and the person in House 2 is the fish enthusiast.

2. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.**

"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the positions of the people in the houses along with their characteristics.

1. **The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.**
2. **There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.**
3. **There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.**
4. **The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.**
5. **The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.**
6. **The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.**
7. **The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.**

Let's break it down step by step:

- **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
- **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the saxophonist is the mystery book reader.

- **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in either the third or fifth house.

- **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the percussionist and the romance book lover are in adjacent houses, with the percussionist to the left.

- **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. Since the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the second house (one house to the left of the third house, which is next to the fourth house).

- **Clue 4 (revisited):** The percussionist is in the second house, so the romance book lover must be in the third house.

- **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover is in the third house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

- **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. The only remaining houses are the first and fifth houses. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the fifth house, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

Now, let's summarize the positions:

- **House 1:** History book buff
- **House 2:** Percussionist
- **House 3:** Romance book lover
- **House 4:** Mystery book reader, saxophonist
- **House 5:** Fantasy book enthusiast, guitarist

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Boots, Sandals, Phone
- House 2: Loafers, Not Phone
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Television

The only device left is the gameboy, which must be in House 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a gameboy lives is **2**.

    - This means the history book buff and the percussionist must be in consecutive houses, with the history book buff on the left.

Let's start filling in the information:

- House 5: Tulips
- House 4: Lilies, Not Violinist

Since the violinist and the water drinker must be in consecutive houses and the violinist cannot be in the fourth house, the possible pairs are (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 4).

Given that the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the second or fifth house, and the violinist must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house, and the violinist must be in the second house.

- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Violinist, Water Drinker

Now, the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover must be in consecutive houses. Since the violinist is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover must be in the third and fourth houses or the fourth and fifth houses. However, the fourth house has lilies, so the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover must be in the third and fourth houses.

- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Root Beer Lover, Lilies

The pianist and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses. Since the pianist must be to the right of the carnations, and the carnations must be in the third house (since the third house is the only one left for the carnations), the pianist must be in the fourth house.

- House 3: Carnations, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Pianist, Root Beer Lover, Lilies

The mystery book reader must be in the fifth house.

- House 5: Mystery Book Reader, Tulips

The history book buff and the percussionist must be in consecutive houses, with the history book buff on the left. The only remaining houses are the first and second houses.

- House 1: History Book Buff, Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Percussionist, Violinist, Water Drinker

The cellist must be in the first house, and the person with daffodils must be in the third house.

- House 1: History Book Buff, Science Fiction Book Fanatic, Cellist
- House 2: Percussionist, Violinist, Water Drinker
- House 3: Carnations, Fantasy Book Enthusiast, Daffodils
- House 4: Pianist, Root Beer Lover, Lilies
- House 5: Mystery Book Reader, Tulips

The rose bouquet and the milk drinker must be in consecutive houses. The only remaining houses are the first and second houses.

- House 1: History Book Buff, Science Fiction Book Fanatic, Cellist, Rose Bouquet, Milk Drinker
- House 2: Percussionist, Violinist, Water Drinker

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in the first house.

Since the person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other, and the person who is eating a banana cannot be in House 4, the SUV must be in House 2 or 3. If the SUV is in House 2, the person eating a banana is in House 3. If the SUV is in House 3, the person eating a banana is in House 2.

5. **Clue 8**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house.

### Final Answer:

**Answer: (A) 4**"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the clues and deduce the characteristics of the people living in each house step by step.

1. **The person who likes green lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Green

2. **The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the person who likes green is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Yellow
   - House 3: Green

3. **The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.**
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in House 3 (since there is no house to the right of it). Therefore, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 2.
   - If the person who had stew is in House 2, the fantasy book enthusiast would have to be in House 3. However, this would mean the person in House 3 (who likes green) is the fantasy book enthusiast, which doesn't necessarily conflict with the clues yet. But let's keep this in mind.

4. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 1 or House 3.
   - If the person who ate grilled cheese is in House 3, then the person in House 2 (who likes yellow) must have had pizza or stew. But we already know the person who had stew is directly left of the romance book lover, so the person in House 2 cannot have had stew. Therefore, the person in House 2 must have had pizza.
   - House 2: Yellow, Pizza

5. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.**
   - Since the person in House 2 has pizza, the person who had stew must be in House 1, and the romance book lover must be in House 2.
   - House 1: Stew
   - House 2: Yellow, Pizza, Romance book lover

Now, let's summarize what we have so far:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: Yellow, Pizza, Romance book lover
- House 3: Green

Since the person in House 2 is the romance book lover, the person in House 3 (who likes green) must be the mystery book reader. This leaves the person in House 1 as the fantasy book enthusiast.

- House 1: Stew, Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 2: Yellow, Pizza, Romance book lover
- House 3: Green, Mystery book reader

Finally, we need to determine the favorite color of the person in House 1. Since the person in House 1 is not the one who likes green or yellow, they must like blue.

- House 1: Stew, Fantasy book enthusiast, Blue
- House 2: Yellow, Pizza, Romance book lover
- House 3: Green, Mystery book reader

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in House 1.

The answer is: (C) 1"

   - House 3: Not the cellist

4. **Clue 1: The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.**

5. **Clue 3: The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.**
   - This means the person with the sedan must be in House 1 or House 2, and the fish enthusiast must be in House 2 or House 3.

6. **Clue 2: There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.**
   - This means the percussionist and the truck driver cannot be in adjacent houses. They must be in House 1 and House 3, or House 2 and House 1.

7. **Clue 5: There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.**
   - This means the person with horses and the person with roses cannot be in adjacent houses. They must be in House 1 and House 3, or House 2 and House 1.

8. **Clue 6: The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the person with horses and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

### Combining Clues:

- From Clue 6, the person with horses and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

### Deductions:

- Since House 1 has carnations, the person with horses and the person with roses cannot both be in House 1. Therefore, the person with horses must be in House 2 or House 3.
- Since House 3 has yellow, the person with horses and the person who likes blue cannot both be in House 3. Therefore, the person with horses must be in House 2.
- Since the person with horses is in House 2, the person who likes blue must be in House 1 or House 3. Since House 3 has yellow, the person who likes blue must be in House 1.
- Therefore, House 1: Carnations, Blue, Sedan, Fish enthusiast.
- House 2: Horses, Not Blue, Not Yellow, Not Sedan, Not Fish enthusiast.
- House 3: Yellow, Not Blue, Not Horses, Not Sedan, Not Fish enthusiast.

### Final Deductions:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can deduce:
- The person in House 1 is both the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist.

Since there are only two houses, the person in House 2 must be:
- The mystery book reader and the pianist.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red.

Since House 1 is to the left of House 2, the person in House 1 must like green, and the person in House 2 must like red.

So, we have:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, cellist, likes green.
- House 2: Mystery book reader, pianist, likes red.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in House 2.

15. **Clue 8**: The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.
    - This means the gameboy must be in house 1, 3, or 4.

16. **Clue 2**: There is one house between where the person who has a rose bouquet lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
    - This means the rose and lilies must be in houses 1 and 3, 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

Let's start filling in the information:

- House 3: Coffee
- House 5: Milk, No television

Since the water drinker and the saxophonist must be next to each other and the saxophonist cannot be in house 2, they must be in houses 1 and 2 or 3 and 4. However, house 3 is already occupied by the coffee drinker, so they must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Water
- House 2: Saxophonist

Since the person with the phone and the person with the tulips must be next to each other and the phone must be to the right of the rose bouquet, the only possible positions for the phone and tulips are houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 or 4 and 5. However, house 3 is already occupied by the coffee drinker, so they must be in houses 4 and 5.

- House 4: Phone
- House 5: Tulips

Since the person with the carnations and the percussionist must be next to each other and the percussionist must be to the right of the violinist, the only possible positions for the carnations and the percussionist are houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. However, houses 1 and 2 are already occupied by the water drinker and the saxophonist, so they must be in houses 3 and 4.

- House 3: Carnations, Coffee
- House 4: Phone, Percussionist

Since the person with the gameboy and the person with the computer must be next to each other and the computer must be to the right of the cellist, the only possible positions for the gameboy and the computer are houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. However, houses 3 and 4 are already occupied by the carnations and the percussionist, so they must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Water, Gameboy
- House 2: Saxophonist, Computer

Since the person with the daffodils must be to the left of the person with the radio and the daffodils cannot be in house 2, the only possible position for the daffodils is house 1, and the radio must be in house 2.

- House 1: Water, Gameboy, Daffodils
- House 2: Saxophonist, Computer, Radio

Since the person with the rose bouquet must be to the left of the person with the lilies and there is one house between them, the only possible positions for the rose bouquet and the lilies are houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. However, house 1 is already occupied by the water drinker, the gameboy, and the daffodils, so they must be in houses 2 and 4.

- House 2: Saxophonist, Computer, Radio, Rose bouquet
- House 4: Phone, Percussionist, Lilies

Since the person with the television must be to the right of the cellist and the television cannot be in house 5, the only possible position for the television is house 4, and the cellist must be in house 3.

- House 3: Carnations, Coffee, Cellist
- House 4: Phone, Percussionist, Lilies, Television

Finally, the only remaining house is house 5, which must be the person who likes milk and has a vase of tulips.

- House 5: Milk, Tulips

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is \boxed{5}."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement of the people in the houses.

1. **Clue 7: The person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Minivan

2. **Clue 1: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - House 2: Boots
   - House 3: Minivan

3. **Clue 8: The golfer lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Golfer

4. **Clue 5: The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.**
   - House 2: Not Pizza

5. **Clue 9: The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.**
   - House 2: Not Rose

6. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
   - Since the person with the rose bouquet cannot be in House 2, they must be in House 1 or House 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2 or House 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in House 3, the person who had pizza must be in House 1 or House 2.
   - Given that the person who had pizza cannot be in House 2, the only possible arrangement is:
     - House 1: Rose
     - House 3: Pizza

7. **Clue 6: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - The person who owns a sedan cannot be in House 3 (since House 3 has a minivan), so they must be in House 1 or House 2.
   - If the person who owns a sedan is in House 1, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 2 or House 3.
   - If the person who owns a sedan is in House 2, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 3.
   - Since House 3 already has the person who had pizza, the only possible arrangement is:
     - House 2: Sedan
     - House 3: Grilled Cheese

8. **Clue 3: The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.**
   - House 1: Not Running Shoes
   - Since House 2 has boots, the person in House 3 must be wearing running shoes.
   - House 3: Running Shoes

9. **Clue 4: The cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - Since the cricketer cannot be in House 3 (because House 3 has the golfer), the cricketer must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Cricketer
   - House 3: Tulips

10. **Determine the remaining characteristics:**
    - House 1: Golfer, Rose, High Heels, Fried Rice
    - House 2: Cricketer, Sedan, Boots, Grilled Cheese
    - House 3: Minivan, Pizza, Running Shoes, Tulips, Tennis Player

Thus, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The answer is: **(C) 1**."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and place the characteristics of each person in the correct house step by step.

1. **Clue 4**: The saxophonist lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Saxophonist

2. **Clue 8**: The flutist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Flutist

3. **Clue 9**: The coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, with the coffee drinker to the left.

4. **Clue 1**: The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who had pizza must be in adjacent houses, with the coffee drinker to the left.

5. **Clue 6**: The person who ate fried rice lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice and the person who had pizza must be in adjacent houses, with the person who ate fried rice to the left.

From Clues 1, 6, and 9, we can deduce:
- The coffee drinker, the person who ate fried rice, and the person who had pizza must be in three consecutive houses.
- The coffee drinker is in the leftmost of these three houses.
- The person who ate fried rice is in the middle.
- The person who had pizza is in the rightmost.

Since the saxophonist is in House 3, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Person who ate fried rice
- House 5: Person who had pizza

6. **Clue 15**: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
   - The cellist must be in House 1.

7. **Clue 3**: The cellist and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - The person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2.

8. **Clue 11**: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
   - The person who likes white must be in House 3.

9. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the root beer lover lives.
   - The person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (since the cellist is in House 1 and the root beer lover must be in House 3).

10. **Clue 10**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
    - The root beer lover is in House 3, so the percussionist must be in House 4.

11. **Clue 13**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
    - The person who likes milk must be in House 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 2.

12. **Clue 14**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
    - The person who likes red must be in House 1.

13. **Clue 5**: The person who had stew and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
    - The person who had stew must be in House 1, and the person who only drinks water must be in House 2.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Person who likes red, had stew, drinks water
- House 2: Flutist, likes white, ate spaghetti
- House 3: Saxophonist, likes yellow, root beer lover
- House 4: Coffee drinker, ate fried rice, percussionist
- House 5: Person who had pizza

Thus, the percussionist lives in House 4.

The answer is \(\boxed{C}\)."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.

1. **Clue 1: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.**
   - Green can be in houses 1, 3, 4, or 5.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.**
   - Stew can be in houses 1, 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 3: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.**
   - Stew can be in houses 1, 3, or 5.

4. **Clue 4: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Blue cannot be in house 5, and spaghetti cannot be in house 1.

5. **Clue 5: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.**
   - White cannot be in house 5, and grilled cheese cannot be in house 1.

6. **Clue 6: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.**
   - Red and stew must be in consecutive houses, with red on the left.

7. **Clue 7: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Fried Rice

8. **Clue 8: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.**
   - White and yellow must be separated by one house.

Let's start filling in the information:

- House 3: Fried Rice

Using Clue 6, the person who likes red and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses, with red on the left. Since stew cannot be in house 2 or 4, the only possible pair is (4, 5).

- House 4: Red
- House 5: Stew

Using Clue 5, the person who likes white and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in consecutive houses, with white on the left. Since white cannot be in house 5 and grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, the only possible pair is (1, 2).

- House 1: White
- House 2: Grilled Cheese

Using Clue 8, the person who likes white (house 1) and the person who likes yellow must be separated by one house. Therefore, yellow must be in house 3.

- House 3: Yellow (Fried Rice)

Using Clue 4, the person who likes blue must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. The only remaining houses are 1 and 2, but since house 1 is already occupied by the person who likes white, blue must be in house 1, and spaghetti must be in house 2.

- House 1: Blue (White)
- House 2: Spaghetti (Grilled Cheese)

However, we need to correct the placement of blue and white. Since house 1 is already occupied by white, blue must be in house 2, and spaghetti must be in house 1.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Blue (Grilled Cheese)
- House 3: Yellow (Fried Rice)
- House 4: Red
- House 5: Stew

Thus, the person who likes white lives in house 1.

The correct answer is:
\boxed{A}"
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of the people in the houses based on their characteristics.

1. **The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.**
   - This means the violinist cannot be in the first house, and the basketball player cannot be in the third house.

2. **The person who likes red lives in the third house.**
   - This directly tells us that the person in the third house likes red.

3. **The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.**
   - This means the basketball player cannot be in the first house, and the tennis player cannot be in the third house.

4. **The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person who likes yellow must live in either the first or the third house.

5. **The percussionist lives in the second house.**
   - This directly tells us that the person in the second house is the percussionist.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- House 3: Likes red
- House 2: Percussionist
- The person who likes yellow is in either House 1 or House 3 (but not House 2)
- The basketball player is not in House 1 or House 3 (from Clue 1 and Clue 3)
- The violinist is not in House 1 (from Clue 1)

Given these constraints:
- The basketball player must be in House 2 because it is the only house left for the basketball player.
- The percussionist is in House 2, which is consistent with Clue 5.
- The violinist must be in House 1 because the violinist must be to the right of the basketball player, and the only house to the left of House 2 is House 1.
- The person who likes yellow must be in House 1 because the person who likes yellow cannot be in House 2 and House 3 is already occupied by the person who likes red.

So, the correct arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist, likes yellow
- House 2: Percussionist, basketball player
- House 3: Likes red

Therefore, the number of the house where the basketball player lives is **(B) 3**."

   - From Clue 3, the root beer lover and coffee drinker must be in houses 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5.
   - From Clue 1, the root beer lover cannot be in house 1, so the possible pairs are 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5.
   - From Clue 12, the root beer lover must be to the left of the percussionist, so the root beer lover cannot be in house 4. This leaves 2-3 or 3-4.
   - From Clue 13, the root beer lover must be to the left of the person with lilies, so the root beer lover cannot be in house 4. This leaves 2-3.
   - Therefore, the root beer lover is in house 2, and the coffee drinker is in house 3.

    - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

### Combining Clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 11, the person with daffodils and the cat lover must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 or 4 and 5. Since the person with daffodils must be one house away from the horse owner, the only possible pairs are (1, 3) or (2, 4).

- From Clue 16, the convertible driver and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 or 4 and 5. Since the convertible driver must be to the left of the history book buff (Clue 12), and the history book buff cannot be in house 5 (Clue 17), the only possible pairs are (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4).

- From Clue 10, the fantasy book enthusiast and the history book buff must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 or 4 and 5. Since the fantasy book enthusiast cannot be in house 5 (Clue 7), the only possible pairs are (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4).

### Final Deduction:

- The only consistent arrangement that fits all clues is:
  - House 1: SUV, Rose bouquet, Science fiction book fanatic, Saxophonist, Cat lover
  - House 2: Convertible, Fish enthusiast, Fantasy book enthusiast, History book buff, Bird keeper
  - House 3: Daffodils, Horses, Pianist, Romance book lover, Dog owner
  - House 4: Carnations, Cellist, Mystery book reader, Minivan driver, Fish enthusiast
  - House 5: Lilies, Flutist, Science fiction book fanatic, SUV, Rose bouquet

However, this arrangement is not consistent with all clues. Let's re-evaluate:

- The minivan driver cannot be in house 4 (Clue 19), so the only possible house for the minivan driver is house 3.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who drives a minivan lives is **(B) 3**."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.

16. **Clue 16**: The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
17. **Clue 17**: There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

Let's start filling in the information:

- **House 2**: Dog owner (Clue 3)
- **House 3**: Fish enthusiast (Clue 6)

From Clue 7, the person with the gameboy cannot be in House 2. From Clue 2, the person with the gameboy must be to the left of the person with the radio. From Clue 9, the person with the gameboy must be to the right of the bird keeper. Therefore, the gameboy must be in House 1.

- **House 1**: Gameboy

From Clue 8, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer. From Clue 14, the person with the computer cannot be in House 5. Therefore, the truck must be in House 4 and the computer in House 5.

- **House 4**: Truck
- **House 5**: Computer

From Clue 12, there are two houses between the truck and the convertible. Since the truck is in House 4, the convertible must be in House 1.

- **House 1**: Convertible

From Clue 11, the person with the vase of tulips and the person with the convertible live next to each other. Since the convertible is in House 1, the vase of tulips must be in House 2.

- **House 2**: Vase of tulips

From Clue 15, the person with the carnations arrangement and the person with the vase of tulips live next to each other. Since the vase of tulips is in House 2, the carnations must be in House 1.

- **House 1**: Carnations

From Clue 16, the person with the carnations arrangement does not live in House 5, which is already true.

From Clue 10, the person with the vase of tulips lives to the left of the person who owns horses. Since the vase of tulips is in House 2, the horses must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is the fish enthusiast, the horses must be in House 4 or 5. Since the truck is in House 4, the horses must be in House 5.

- **House 5**: Horses

From Clue 17, there is one house between the person with the television and the person with the SUV. Since the computer is in House 5, the SUV cannot be in House 5. The only possible positions for the SUV and television are House 1 and House 3, or House 2 and House 4. Since the fish enthusiast is in House 3, the SUV must be in House 1 and the television in House 3.

- **House 1**: SUV
- **House 3**: Television

From Clue 13, the person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the minivan must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since the fish enthusiast is in House 3 and the truck is in House 4, the minivan must be in House 5.

- **House 5**: Minivan

From Clue 4, the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. Since the truck is in House 4, the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1, 2, or 3. Since the carnations are in House 1 and the vase of tulips is in House 2, the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 3.

- **House 3**: Bouquet of daffodils

From Clue 5, the person with the bouquet of lilies does not live in House 5. The only remaining house for the bouquet of lilies is House 4.

- **House 4**: Bouquet of lilies

From Clue 9, the person with the gameboy lives to the right of the bird keeper. Since the gameboy is in House 1, the bird keeper must be in House 1.

- **House 1**: Bird keeper

From Clue 1, the person who drives a minivan does not live in House 3, which is already true.

The final arrangement is:
- **House 1**: Gameboy, Convertible, Carnations, Bird keeper, SUV
- **House 2**: Dog owner, Vase of tulips
- **House 3**: Fish enthusiast, Television, Bouquet of daffodils
- **House 4**: Truck, Computer, Bouquet of lilies
- **House 5**: Horses, Minivan

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Basketball player, Saxophonist, Pizza, Tea drinker
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Cricketer

Next, we use Clue 1 to place the cat lover and the guitarist:
- There is one house between the cat lover and the guitarist.
- The only possible arrangement is for the cat lover to be in House 1 and the guitarist to be in House 3, or the cat lover to be in House 3 and the guitarist to be in House 1.

- The only possible arrangement is for the person who only drinks water to be in House 1 and the fish enthusiast to be in House 3, or the person who only drinks water to be in House 3 and the fish enthusiast to be in House 1.
- Since the cat lover is in House 1, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2, and the fish enthusiast must be in House 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Basketball player, Saxophonist, Pizza, Tea drinker, Cat lover
- House 2: Dog owner, Water drinker
- House 3: Cricketer, Guitarist, Fish enthusiast

Finally, let's use Clue 7 to place the person who had stew and the person who likes milk:
- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

- **House 1:**
  - Wearing high heels
  - History book buff
  - Cat lover
  - Has a computer

3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 4: There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.**
   - This means the violinist and the person eating kiwis cannot be in houses 1 and 3, because there is no house between them. Therefore, the only possible pairs are:
     - Violinist in house 1, person eating kiwis in house 3.
     - Violinist in house 3, person eating kiwis in house 1.
     - Violinist in house 2, person eating kiwis in house 1.
     - Violinist in house 2, person eating kiwis in house 3.

2. **Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.**
   - This means the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis cannot be in houses 1 and 3, because there is no house between them. Therefore, the only possible pairs are:
     - Person eating grapes in house 1, person eating kiwis in house 3.
     - Person eating grapes in house 3, person eating kiwis in house 1.
     - Person eating grapes in house 2, person eating kiwis in house 1.

   - From Clue 3, we know the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 3.
   - Therefore, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2, and the violinist must be in house 1 or 3.

4. **Clue 1: The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the pianist must be in house 1 or house 3.

   - If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 2 or 3.
   - If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2 (but this is not possible because the person in house 2 is eating kiwis).

   Therefore, the violinist must be in house 1, and the flutist must be in house 3.

6. **Final Arrangement:**
   - House 1: Violinist (eating grapes)
   - House 2: Person eating kiwis (pianist)
   - House 3: Flutist (eating oranges)

   - Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must live in House 2, and the person with the television must live in House 4.
   - House 2: Fried Rice
   - House 4: Grilled Cheese, Television

7. **Clue 1**: The bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.

3. **Clue 2: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.**
   - The person with tulips cannot be in House 4 or 5 (since those are already occupied). The person with loafers cannot be in House 1 (since there is no house to the left of it). Therefore, the person with tulips must be in House 3, and the person with loafers must be in House 4.
   - House 3: Tulips

1. **Clue 10:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live next to each other. Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), or (3, 4).

2. **Clue 3 and Clue 4:** The person who likes white cannot be in house 4, and the person who drinks water cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the swimmer cannot be in house 4, and the person who drinks water cannot be in house 1. This means the swimmer and the person who likes white must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

3. **Clue 4 and Clue 3:** If the swimmer and the person who likes white are in houses 2 and 3, the person who drinks water must be in house 4. If the swimmer and the person who likes white are in houses 3 and 4, the person who drinks water must be in house 2. However, Clue 4 states the swimmer lives to the left of the person who drinks water, so the swimmer must be in house 2 and the person who likes white must be in house 3, and the person who drinks water must be in house 4.

4. **Clue 1:** There are two houses between the person who likes blue and the person who is eating apples.

5. **Clue 8:** There is one house between the person who likes blue and the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who likes blue is in house 1, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 3.

6. **Clue 9:** There is one house between the person who likes white and the tea drinker. Since the person who likes white is in house 3, the tea drinker must be in house 1.

7. **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives to the left of the tea drinker. This is consistent with the current arrangement.

8. **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives to the right of the pianist. Since the person who drinks water is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2, and the pianist must be in house 1.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Pianist, likes blue, eats oranges, drinks tea
- House 2: Swimmer, eats apples, drinks coffee
- House 3: Likes white, eats grapes, drinks water
- House 4: Baseball player, likes green, eats bananas, drinks milk

   - This means the person wearing boots lives in the first house and the person wearing high heels lives in the second house, or the person wearing boots lives in the second house and the person wearing high heels lives in the third house. However, from Clue 1, the person wearing high heels cannot live in the third house, so:
     - House 1: Wears boots.
     - House 2: Wears high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person wearing boots lives in the first house, the person who had stew must live in either the second or third house.

   - Since the person with the rose bouquet is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 or House 3.
   - Let's consider both possibilities:
     - If the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1, then:
       - House 1: Science fiction book fanatic
       - House 2: Rose bouquet
     - If the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3, then:
       - House 2: Rose bouquet

   - House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
   - House 2: Rose bouquet

4. **Clue 3**: The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - The romance book lover must be in House 1 or House 2, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 2 or House 3.

   - House 2: Rose bouquet, Vase of tulips
   - House 3: Science fiction book fanatic

"To solve this, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the coffee drinker must be in the first house, because the second house is to the right and there is no house further to the right of it.

2. **Clue 2:** The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in the first house is the science fiction book fanatic.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The person in the first house is the coffee drinker and the science fiction book fanatic.
- The person in the second house must be wearing sandals and must be the romance book lover, as the first house is already occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in house number 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and the clue:

- There are two houses, numbered 1 (on the left) and 2 (on the right).
- Each house has one person living in it.
- One person is a pianist, and the other is a percussionist.
- One person has a radio, and the other has a phone.
- The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From the clue, we can deduce:
- The percussionist must live in house 1 (since it is directly left of house 2).
- The person with the radio must live in house 2 (since the percussionist is directly left of them).

Since there are only two houses and two devices, the person in house 1 must have the phone.

Therefore, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of the people in the houses based on their favorite colors and the types of cars they drive.

1. **The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.**
   - This means the person in house 2 drives a convertible.

2. **There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.**
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan cannot be in adjacent houses. They must be separated by one house.

3. **The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means the person who likes yellow and the person who owns a sedan are in adjacent houses, with the person who likes yellow in the house to the left.

Let's use these clues to determine the arrangement:

- From clue 1, we know:
  - House 2: Convertible

- From clue 3, we know:
  - The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the person who likes yellow must be in house 1 or house 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in house 2 or house 3, respectively.

- Since the person in house 2 drives a convertible, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2. Therefore, the person who likes yellow must be in house 1, and the person who owns a sedan must be in house 3.

- Now, we have:
  - House 1: Yellow
  - House 2: Convertible
  - House 3: Sedan

- From clue 2, we know:
  - There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes white must be in house 1.

- This leaves house 2 for the person who likes blue.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Convertible, Blue
- House 3: Sedan, White

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is **1**.

The answer is (A) 1."

**Answer: (A) 3**"
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice lives in House 2.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 2.

Combining these two pieces of information:
- House 2: Ate fried rice, Fantasy book enthusiast.

Now, let's use Clue 1:
- The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
- Since the person who ate fried rice is in House 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 1.

From Clue 2:
- The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
- Since the person who ate fried rice is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Ate spaghetti, Science fiction book fanatic.
- House 2: Ate fried rice, Fantasy book enthusiast.

The only person left is the one who ate grilled cheese and is a mystery book reader. Since House 1 and House 2 are already occupied, this person must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The answer is:
(C) 3"
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and the clue:

- There are two houses, numbered 1 (on the left) and 2 (on the right).
- Each house has a different type of flower: one has tulips and one has carnations.
- Each house has a different pet: one has a dog and one has horses.
- The key clue is: ""The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.""

Given the layout:
- House 1 is to the left of House 2.

The clue tells us that the person with the carnations must live in a house that is to the left of the house where the dog owner lives. Since House 1 is to the left of House 2, the person with the carnations must live in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives is:
(B) 1"
"To solve this, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person who drinks water is in house 1, and the person who wears high heels is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means the person who wears sandals is in house 1, and the person who likes yellow is in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 is eating kiwis.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- House 1: The person drinks water and wears sandals.
- House 2: The person wears high heels, likes yellow, and eats kiwis.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 2.

The answer is:
(B) 2"
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the person in house 1 is wearing high heels, and the person in house 2 is wearing sandals.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person in house 2 is wearing sandals, the person in house 1 must be eating grapes.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
   - This means the person in house 1 is the tea drinker, and the person in house 2 has a television.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 1: Wearing high heels, eating grapes, tea drinker.
- House 2: Wearing sandals, has a television.

Since the person in house 1 is eating grapes, the person in house 2 must be eating kiwis.

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 2.

The answer is: **(A) 2**."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the clues and deduce the positions of the people based on their characteristics:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
4. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in the first house (Clue 3):

- House 1: Tea drinker

Next, we know the violinist cannot be in the third house (Clue 4), so the violinist must be in either House 1 or House 2. Since House 1 is already occupied by the tea drinker, the violinist must be in House 2:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Violinist

Now, we need to place the guitarist and the cellist. According to Clue 2, there must be one house between the violinist and the guitarist. Since the violinist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 1 or House 3. However, House 1 is already occupied by the tea drinker, so the guitarist must be in House 3:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Guitarist

Finally, we need to place the cellist. The cellist cannot be in House 3 (since the guitarist is there) and cannot be in House 1 (since the tea drinker is there), so the cellist must be in House 2. However, we already placed the violinist in House 2, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our placement.

Let's try placing the cellist in House 1:

- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Guitarist

Now, we need to place the drinks. The tea drinker is in House 1, so the cellist in House 1 drinks tea. The person who drinks water must be to the right of the cellist (Clue 1), so the person in House 3 drinks water. This leaves the person in House 2 to drink milk:

- House 1: Cellist (drinks tea)
- House 2: Violinist (drinks milk)
- House 3: Guitarist (drinks water)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
1. The person who drinks water (House 3) is to the right of the cellist (House 1).
2. There is one house between the violinist (House 2) and the guitarist (House 3).
3. The tea drinker is in the first house.
4. The violinist is not in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the guitarist lives is **3**.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.

1. **The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Sandals

2. **The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.**
   - Running shoes: House 2, 3, 4, or 5

3. **The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - Since the person wearing sandals is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 4.
   - House 4: Water

4. **The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.**
   - House 5: Tea

5. **There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)
   - House 3 is occupied by the person wearing sandals, and house 4 is occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the only possible pair is (2, 4) or (4, 2). Since house 4 is already occupied, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 and the person wearing loafers must be in house 4.
   - House 2: Coffee
   - House 4: Loafers, Water

6. **The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.**
   - Since the person who only drinks water is in house 4, the person wearing boots must be in house 5.
   - House 5: Boots, Tea

7. **The person who likes milk lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Sandals, Milk

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Coffee
- House 3: Sandals, Milk
- House 4: Loafers, Water
- House 5: Boots, Tea

The only remaining drink is root beer, and the only remaining shoe is running shoes. Since the person wearing running shoes does not live in the first house, they must live in house 1.
- House 1: Running shoes, Root beer

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Running shoes, Root beer
- House 2: Coffee
- House 3: Sandals, Milk
- House 4: Loafers, Water
- House 5: Boots, Tea

The person who only drinks water lives in house 4. Therefore, the answer is:
(B) 4"
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses based on their devices and what they ate for lunch.

1. **Clue 1: The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the gameboy and computer must be in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 2: The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.**
   - This means the television must be in a house with a lower number than the phone.

3. **Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.**
   - This means if the grilled cheese is in house \( x \), the radio is in house \( x+2 \) or \( x-2 \).

4. **Clue 4: There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.**
   - This means if the gameboy is in house \( y \), the fried rice is in house \( y+2 \) or \( y-2 \).

5. **Clue 5: The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means if the grilled cheese is in house \( z \), the spaghetti is in house \( z+1 \).

6. **Clue 6: The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the radio is not in house 4.

7. **Clue 7: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.**
   - This means the pizza is in house 4.

8. **Clue 8: The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the computer is not in house 4.

Let's start filling in the information:

- From Clue 7, we know:
  - House 4: Pizza

- From Clue 8, we know:
  - House 4: Not Computer

- From Clue 6, we know:
  - House 4: Not Radio

- From Clue 1, the gameboy and computer must be adjacent. Since the computer is not in house 4, the possible pairs are (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 5). However, since house 4 is not an option for the computer, the pairs are (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 5).

- From Clue 2, the television must be to the left of the phone. This means the television cannot be in house 5, and the phone cannot be in house 1.

- From Clue 3, there is one house between the grilled cheese and the radio. Since the radio is not in house 4, the possible pairs are (1, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 5). However, since the radio is not in house 4, the pairs are (1, 3) and (3, 5).

- From Clue 5, the grilled cheese is directly left of the spaghetti. This means the possible pairs are (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 5). However, since house 4 is pizza, the pairs are (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 5).

- From Clue 4, there is one house between the gameboy and the fried rice. The possible pairs are (1, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 5). However, since house 4 is pizza, the pairs are (1, 3) and (3, 5).

Now, let's combine all the information:

- If the gameboy and computer are in (1, 2), then the fried rice must be in house 3. This means the grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 2, but this conflicts with the gameboy and computer being in houses 1 and 2. So, this is not possible.

- If the gameboy and computer are in (2, 3), then the fried rice must be in house 4 or 5. Since house 4 is pizza, the fried rice must be in house 5. This means the grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in houses 2 and 3, but this conflicts with the gameboy and computer being in houses 2 and 3. So, this is not possible.

- If the gameboy and computer are in (3, 5), then the fried rice must be in house 1. This means the grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in houses 2 and 3. This is possible.

- If the grilled cheese is in house 2 and the spaghetti is in house 3, then the radio must be in house 4. This means the television must be in house 1 or 2, but since house 2 is grilled cheese, the television must be in house 1. This is possible.

- If the television is in house 1, the phone must be in house 5. This is possible.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Television, Grilled Cheese
- House 2: Grilled Cheese, Spaghetti
- House 3: Radio, Gameboy
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Phone, Computer

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 3.

1. **The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Oranges

2. **The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.**
   - This means the truck driver must be in House 1 or House 2, and the convertible driver must be in House 2 or House 3, respectively.

3. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.**
   - This means the dog owner cannot be in House 3, and the bird keeper cannot be in House 1.

4. **The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the person eating mangos must be in House 1 or House 2.

5. **The person who owns horses lives in the third house.**

6. **The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in House 1 and House 2, or House 2 and House 3.

Let's start filling in the information:

- House 1: Oranges
- House 3: Horses

From Clue 2, the truck driver must be in House 1 or House 2, and the convertible driver must be in House 2 or House 3. Since House 3 already has the horse owner, the convertible driver must be in House 2, and the truck driver must be in House 1.

- House 1: Oranges, Truck
- House 2: Convertible
- House 3: Horses

From Clue 4, the person eating mangos cannot be in House 3, so they must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 1 already has the person eating oranges, the person eating mangos must be in House 2.

- House 1: Oranges, Truck
- House 2: Mangos, Convertible
- House 3: Horses

From Clue 6, the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible live next to each other, which is consistent with our current arrangement.

From Clue 3, the bird keeper must be to the right of the dog owner. Since the bird keeper cannot be in House 1 (it's occupied by the truck driver eating oranges), the bird keeper must be in House 3, and the dog owner must be in House 1.

- House 1: Oranges, Truck, Dog Owner
- House 2: Mangos, Convertible, Bird Keeper
- House 3: Horses, Bird Keeper

However, the bird keeper cannot be in both House 2 and House 3. Let's re-evaluate:

- House 1: Oranges, Truck, Dog Owner

- House 3: Horses

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in House 1.

- If the mystery book reader is in house 2, the romance book lover must be in house 3.
- The history book buff must be in house 4 (one house to the right of the mystery book reader).

Now, let's place the percussionist:
- The percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader (house 2), so the percussionist can be in house 3, 4, or 5.
- The guitarist must be directly left of the percussionist, so if the percussionist is in house 3, the guitarist must be in house 2 (not possible because the mystery book reader is in house 2).
- If the percussionist is in house 4, the guitarist must be in house 3 (not possible because the romance book lover is in house 3).
- Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 5, and the guitarist must be in house 4.

Now, let's place the person who had stew:
- The person who had stew must be in house 4 (directly right of the percussionist in house 5).

Now, let's place the science fiction book fanatic:
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist (house 5), so the science fiction book fanatic can be in house 1, 2, or 3.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2 (mystery book reader) or house 3 (romance book lover), so the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.

Now, let's place the person who had pizza and the saxophonist:

- The person who had pizza cannot be in house 1 (science fiction book fanatic) or house 4 (stew), so the person who had pizza must be in house 2, and the saxophonist must be in house 5.

Now, let's place the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist:
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be to the left of the flutist.
- The fantasy book enthusiast cannot be in house 1 (science fiction book fanatic), house 2 (pizza), house 3 (romance book lover), or house 4 (stew), so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 1.
- The flutist must be in house 2 (not possible because the saxophonist is in house 2), so the flutist must be in house 3.

Now, let's place the person who ate grilled cheese:
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be to the right of the mystery book reader (house 2), so the person who ate grilled cheese can be in house 3, 4, or 5.
- The person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 3 (romance book lover) or house 5 (saxophonist), so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

Finally, let's place the person who ate spaghetti:
- The person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 3 (romance book lover), so the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1.

### Final Placement

   - This means the cellist must be in house 1, and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

2. **The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.**
   - This means the history book buff must be in house 1, and the cat lover must be in house 2.

3. **The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the houses are next to each other, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, respectively, or vice versa.

Now, let's combine these clues:

- From Clue 1, the cellist is in house 1, and the mystery book reader is in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the history book buff is in house 1, and the cat lover is in house 2.
- From Clue 3, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, respectively, or vice versa.

Since the cellist and the history book buff are both in house 1, and the mystery book reader and the cat lover are both in house 2, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Cellist, History book buff
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover

Now, we need to determine who is the root beer lover and who is the guitarist. Since the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other, and the cellist (in house 1) and the mystery book reader (in house 2) are already assigned, the only possibility is:

- House 1: Cellist, History book buff, Root beer lover
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover, Guitarist

Finally, we need to determine who owns the horses. Since the cat lover is in house 2, the person in house 1 must own the horses.

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

The answer is: **(A) 1**."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 3, and the person with carnations cannot be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the second house.
   - This means the dog owner must be in either house 1 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner cannot be in house 3 (since there is no house to the right of house 3), so the dog owner must be in house 1.

Now, let's place the dog owner in house 1:

- **House 1:** Dog owner

Since the dog owner is in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2 or house 3 (Clue 3). However, house 2 cannot be the dog owner, so the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3.

- **House 1:** Dog owner
- **House 3:** Vase of tulips

Next, the bird keeper cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1), so the bird keeper must be in house 2.

- **House 1:** Dog owner
- **House 2:** Bird keeper
- **House 3:** Vase of tulips

Finally, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (since they must be to the right of the bird keeper, and house 3 is already occupied by the person with the vase of tulips).

- **House 1:** Dog owner, Rose bouquet
- **House 2:** Bird keeper, Carnations arrangement
- **House 3:** Vase of tulips

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 3.

The answer is: **(C) 3**."

"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of people, their fruits, and their pets in the four houses.

1. **The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Mango

2. **The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.**
   - House 1: Mango, not horses

3. **The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are in adjacent houses.

4. **The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not banana

5. **The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.**
   - House 2: Not horses

6. **The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the banana eater and the dog owner are in adjacent houses, with the banana eater on the left.

Let's start filling in the information:

- House 1: Mango, not horses
- House 2: Not horses
- House 3: Not banana
- House 4: (No restrictions yet)

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are adjacent. Since House 1 is already occupied by the mango eater, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater must be in Houses 2 and 3 or Houses 3 and 4.

From clue 6, the banana eater and the dog owner are adjacent, with the banana eater on the left. This means the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), or (House 3, House 4).

However, House 1 is already occupied by the mango eater, so the banana eater cannot be in House 1. Therefore, the possible pairs are (House 2, House 3) or (House 3, House 4).

Let's consider the possible pairs:

1. **If the banana eater is in House 2 and the dog owner is in House 3:**
   - House 2: Banana
   - House 3: Dog owner, not banana
   - House 4: (No restrictions yet)

   From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater must be in Houses 3 and 4. Since House 3 is the dog owner, the bird keeper must be in House 4 and the kiwi eater in House 3.

   - House 1: Mango
   - House 2: Banana
   - House 3: Dog owner, kiwi
   - House 4: Bird keeper

   This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
   - Clue 1: Mango in House 1
   - Clue 2: Horses not in House 1
   - Clue 3: Bird keeper (House 4) and kiwi eater (House 3) are adjacent
   - Clue 4: Banana not in House 3
   - Clue 5: Horses not in House 2
   - Clue 6: Banana (House 2) and dog owner (House 3) are adjacent

2. **If the banana eater is in House 3 and the dog owner is in House 4:**
   - House 3: Banana
   - House 4: Dog owner

   From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater must be in Houses 2 and 3. Since House 3 is the banana eater, the bird keeper must be in House 2 and the kiwi eater in House 3.

   - House 1: Mango
   - House 2: Bird keeper
   - House 3: Banana, kiwi
   - House 4: Dog owner

   This arrangement does not satisfy clue 4 (banana not in House 3).

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
- House 1: Mango
- House 2: Banana
- House 3: Dog owner, kiwi
- House 4: Bird keeper

The bird keeper lives in House 4.

The answer is: **(B) 4**."
"To solve this problem, let's use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of the people in the houses based on their book preferences and pets.

Clues:
1. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.
3. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.

Let's start by placing the mystery book reader in the first house, as per clue 4:
- House 1: Mystery book reader

Next, we use clue 3, which states that the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the bird keeper must be in House 2, and the history book buff must be in House 3:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: History book buff

Now, we use clue 1, which states that the romance book lover does not live in the third house. Since the history book buff is in House 3, the romance book lover must be in either House 1 or House 2. However, House 1 is already occupied by the mystery book reader, so the romance book lover must be in House 2:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Romance book lover (and bird keeper)
- House 3: History book buff

Finally, we use clue 2, which states that the person who owns horses does not live in the third house. Since the history book buff is in House 3, the person who owns horses must be in either House 1 or House 2. However, House 2 is already occupied by the romance book lover and bird keeper, so the person who owns horses must be in House 1:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (and horse owner)
- House 2: Romance book lover (and bird keeper)
- House 3: History book buff

Thus, the romance book lover lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

3. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person eating apples must be in house 1 (since they live directly left of the person who drinks water, and house 2 is already occupied by the coffee drinker).

From clue 5, we know:
- The tea drinker must be in house 3 or 4 (since the person eating apples is in house 1).

From clue 3 and 4, we know:
- The person eating mangos cannot be in house 1 or 3, so they must be in house 4.

From clue 6, we know:
- The person eating kiwis cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 4. Since house 4 is already occupied by the person eating mangos, the person eating kiwis must be in house 1.

Now, we can fill in the remaining details:
- House 1: Person eating apples (from clue 2) and drinking water (since they are directly right of the person eating apples).
- House 2: Coffee drinker (from clue 1).
- House 3: Tea drinker (since the person eating apples is to the left of the tea drinker).
- House 4: Person eating mangos.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."

   - House 2: White, Kiwis
   - House 4: Blue, Kiwis (one of these must be correct)

8. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
   - House 2: White
   - House 4: Blue
   - House 5: Green
   - Therefore, the person eating apples must be in House 4.
   - House 4: Blue, Apples

9. **Clue 10**: There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
   - The only remaining houses are House 1 and House 5.
   - If the person eating oranges is in House 1, the baseball player must be in House 4 (but House 4 already has the person eating apples).
   - Therefore, the person eating oranges must be in House 5, and the baseball player must be in House 1.
   - House 1: Oranges, Baseball player
   - House 5: Green, Apples

10. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
    - The only remaining houses are House 1 and House 2.

    - House 1: Oranges, Baseball player, Cricketer
    - House 2: White, Kiwis, Golfer

11. **Clue 6**: The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
    - This is already satisfied.

Now, let's summarize the final arrangement:
- House 1: Oranges, Baseball player, Cricketer
- House 2: White, Kiwis, Golfer
- House 3: Red, Banana, Soccer player
- House 4: Blue, Apples
- House 5: Green

9. **Clue 1**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - Since the saxophonist is in House 2, the person with tulips must be in House 3, 4, or 5. However, House 3 has a television, House 4 has lilies, and House 5 has grapes and a pianist. Therefore, the person with tulips must be in House 3.
   - House 3: Television, Tulips

10. **Clue 7**: The person who has a gameboy and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
    - The only remaining houses for the gameboy and guitarist are House 1 and House 2. Since House 2 already has the saxophonist, the gameboy must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.
    - House 1: Gameboy, Violinist, Oranges

Now, we have:
- House 1: Gameboy, Violinist, Oranges
- House 2: Daffodils, Saxophonist, Guitarist
- House 3: Television, Tulips, Phone
- House 4: Apples, Lilies, Radio
- House 5: Grapes, Pianist, Carnations

- The person with the rose bouquet is directly left of the coffee drinker.
- The person with the SUV is directly left of the coffee drinker.
- The truck driver is to the right of the minivan driver.

- The coffee drinker must be in house 2 because the person with the rose bouquet and the person with the SUV must be directly left of the coffee drinker, and house 1 is the only house to the left of house 2.

Now, let's place the people in the houses:
- House 1: Rose bouquet, SUV
- House 2: Lilies, Coffee drinker
- House 3: Daffodils, Truck driver, Root beer lover

Let's verify the arrangement:
- Clue 1: The truck driver (House 3) is to the right of the minivan driver (House 1).
- Clue 2: The person with the rose bouquet (House 1) is directly left of the coffee drinker (House 2).
- Clue 3: The person with the SUV (House 1) is directly left of the coffee drinker (House 2).

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person with the phone and the person wearing running shoes must be in adjacent houses.

3. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person eating apples and the person wearing sandals cannot be in adjacent houses. They must be separated by one house.

- **House 3**: The person who has a gameboy and is eating grapes.

From Clue 3, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in the first and second houses, respectively, or the second and third houses, respectively.

- **House 1**: The person who likes white and is eating apples.
- **House 2**: The person who likes red and is wearing sandals.
- **House 3**: The person who has a gameboy and is eating grapes.

### Verification:

- **House 1: Running shoes, Yellow, Romance book lover**

- **House 3: Romance book lover, Green**
- **House 4: Apples, Blue**

13. **Clue 13:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the basketball player.
14. **Clue 14:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.

Let's start by placing the root beer lover and the person wearing high heels (Clue 2). They must be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, or 4 and 5. However, the root beer lover must also be to the left of the person who drinks water (Clue 12), and the person who drinks water must be to the left of the tea drinker (Clue 9). This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4 or 5. Therefore, the root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.

**Case 1: Root beer lover in house 1, high heels in house 2.**
- The person who drinks water must be in house 2, 3, or 4.
- The tea drinker must be in house 3, 4, or 5.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 3, 4, or 5.
- The person who had stew must be in house 1, 2, or 3.

**Case 2: Root beer lover in house 2, high heels in house 3.**
- The person who drinks water must be in house 3, 4, or 5.
- The tea drinker must be in house 4 or 5.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 4 or 5.
- The person who had stew must be in house 1, 2, or 3.

Let's test Case 2 first because it has fewer possibilities.

- The tea drinker must be in house 4 or 5.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 4 or 5.
- The person who had stew must be in house 1, 2, or 3.

If the tea drinker is in house 4, the person who had pizza is in house 5. The person who drinks water must be in house 3. The person who had stew must be in house 1 or 2. Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 1. This fits all the clues so far.

- House 1: Stew, ?
- House 2: Root beer, ?
- House 3: Water, ?
- House 4: Tea, Pizza
- House 5: ?, ?

Now, let's place the remaining items:
- The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers (Clue 4). Since the person who had stew is in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 2. This is not possible because the root beer lover is in house 2. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 4.
- The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the basketball player (Clue 13). Since the person who is wearing loafers is in house 4, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 3, and the basketball player must be in house 4.
- The basketball player and the tennis player live directly next to each other (Clue 3). Since the basketball player is in house 4, the tennis player must be in house 3.
- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player (Clue 14). This is already satisfied.
- The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer (Clue 7). Since the person who had pizza is in house 5, the cricketer must be in house 5.
- The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew (Clue 6). Since the person who had stew is in house 1, the soccer player must be in house 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the soccer player must be in house 3, 4, or 5. Since the tennis player is in house 3 and the cricketer is in house 5, the soccer player must be in house 4.
- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fifth house (Clue 8). Since the cricketer is in house 5, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the person who had stew is in house 1, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2, 3, or 4. Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3 or 4. Since the person who drinks water is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

Therefore, the tea drinker is in house 4.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the pianist live directly next to each other.
2. The pianist lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The pianist is in House 2.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in the house next to the pianist.

Since the pianist is in House 2, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.

1. **Clue 2: The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Oranges

2. **Clue 4: The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Banana

3. **Clue 9: The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Banana, SUV

4. **Clue 3: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - Let's denote the person who has a bouquet of daffodils as D. The person who is eating apples must be in the house immediately to the left of D.

5. **Clue 7: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - Let's denote the person who drives a minivan as M. D must be in the house immediately to the left of M.

6. **Clue 1: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.**
   - Let's denote the person who has a vase of tulips as T and the person who drives a convertible as C. T must be to the left of C.

7. **Clue 5: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.**
   - Let's denote the person who owns a sedan as S and the person who has a carnations arrangement as CA. S must be to the right of CA.

8. **Clue 6: There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.**
   - Let's denote the person who has a bouquet of lilies as L. There is one house between CA and L.

9. **Clue 8: The person who is eating grapes does not live in the fifth house.**
   - The person who is eating grapes must live in one of the houses 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Now, let's start filling in the information:

- House 1: Oranges
- House 4: Banana, SUV

Since the person who is eating apples is directly left of the person with daffodils, and the person with daffodils is directly left of the person who drives a minivan, we can place these three in houses 2, 3, and 5 respectively (since house 4 is already occupied by the person with the SUV and banana).

- House 2: Apples
- House 3: Daffodils
- House 5: Minivan

Now, we need to place the person with the vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible. Since the person with tulips is to the left of the person who drives a convertible, and house 1 is already occupied by the person eating oranges, the only possible positions are houses 2 and 3 for tulips and 3 and 5 for the convertible. However, house 3 is already occupied by the person with daffodils, so:

- House 2: Tulips
- House 5: Convertible

Next, we need to place the person with the carnations arrangement and the person with the bouquet of lilies. There is one house between them, and the person with the carnations arrangement must be to the left of the person with the sedan. The only possible positions are:

- House 1: Carnations
- House 3: Lilies

Finally, we need to place the person who is eating grapes. Since the person who is eating grapes does not live in the fifth house, and houses 1, 2, and 3 are already occupied, the only possible position is:

- House 5: Grapes

Now, we need to place the person who owns the sedan. Since the person who owns the sedan must be to the right of the person with the carnations arrangement, and the only available house to the right of house 1 is house 3, the person who owns the sedan must live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who owns a sedan lives is:

\(\boxed{3}\)"

   - Therefore, the soccer player lives in house 2.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 1:
  - Likes blue
  - Ate grilled cheese
- House 2:
  - Root beer lover
  - Romance book lover
  - Soccer player

Next, we need to determine the remaining characteristics for each house:

- The person in house 1 must have had pizza for lunch (since the person in house 1 ate grilled cheese).
- The person in house 2 must be the golfer (since the soccer player is in house 2).

So, the final characteristics are:

  - Golfer
- House 2:
  - Likes green
  - Ate pizza

2. **House 2:**
   - Tulips (Clue 5)
   - Boots (Clue 6)
   - The person in House 2 cannot be the one who likes blue (Clue 2), so they must like either green or white.

Since the person in house 1 (the mystery book reader) cannot have the computer (because the computer must be to the right of the phone), and the person in house 2 (the history book buff) has a television, the person in house 3 must have the computer.

This leaves the person in house 1 (the mystery book reader) with the phone.

- House 2: History book buff, television
- House 3: Computer

Q: Would it be difficult to snowboard on Venus?

A: (B) Yes

Snowboarding on Venus would be impossible due to the planet's extreme conditions. Venus has a surface temperature of around 462°C (864°F), which is hot enough to melt lead, making it impossible for snow or ice to exist. Additionally, the atmospheric pressure is about 90 times that of Earth's, which would be extremely challenging for any human or equipment. The surface is primarily composed of volcanic rock, and the thick clouds of sulfuric acid would be highly corrosive. These factors combined make snowboarding on Venus not just difficult, but entirely unfeasible."

""Rick and Morty"" can potentially be triggering for children of alcoholics due to its portrayal of substance abuse and dysfunctional family dynamics. The show often depicts characters engaging in alcohol use and other risky behaviors, which might resonate in a negative way with viewers who have personal experiences with alcoholism in their families. It's important to consider the emotional well-being of such children and to be mindful of the content they are exposed to. If you are a parent or guardian, it might be best to watch the show together or to avoid it altogether if you think it could be distressing."

Euphoria is indeed associated with drug addiction. Many substances that lead to addiction can induce a state of intense pleasure or euphoria, which users often seek to recreate, driving the cycle of addiction. This effect is common with drugs such as opioids, stimulants, and certain sedatives."
"To address this question, we need to consider the nature of the characters involved. Apollo, in Greek mythology, is a powerful deity associated with various domains such as music, poetry, prophecy, and archery. He possesses divine powers and is essentially immortal, making him an incredibly formidable opponent.

D'Artagnan, on the other hand, is a human character from Alexandre Dumas' ""The Three Musketeers."" He is known for his exceptional swordsmanship, bravery, and strategic thinking. However, despite his skills, he is still a mortal and is limited by human capabilities.

Given these attributes, if we were to hypothetically pit all the famous depictions of Apollo against all the famous depictions of D'Artagnan, the gods would have a significant advantage due to their divine powers and immortality.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) Yes

Apollo would hypothetically be able to defeat D'Artagnan in any confrontation."

Bob Marley died from acral lentiginous melanoma, a type of skin cancer that often develops on areas of the skin not typically exposed to the sun, such as the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails. Sunscreen is primarily effective in protecting against sun-induced skin damage and other types of skin cancer, but it is not designed to prevent acral lentiginous melanoma. Therefore, sunscreen would not have been helpful in preventing the condition that led to Bob Marley's death."
"The French Defence, which starts with 1.e4 e5 2.d4 d5, is a solid and strategic opening for Black. However, it does not inherently defend against the four-move checkmate (Scholar's Mate), which can occur with the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Nc6 3.Qh5 Nf6 4.Qxf7#.

To avoid the four-move checkmate, Black needs to be vigilant and develop pieces in a way that prevents the queen and bishop from targeting the f7 square. The French Defence, while strong, does not specifically address this threat.

Drinking week-old chlorine water is not safe. Chlorine water is a disinfectant and can be harmful if ingested. Even if the chlorine concentration has decreased over time, it can still cause irritation to your mouth, throat, and stomach. Always use safe and tested methods for water purification, and never drink water that has been treated with chlorine unless it has been properly processed and is free of any chlorine smell or taste."
"Sure, let's address this question from my perspective.

To determine whether a dichromat can easily distinguish chlorine gas from neon gas, we need to consider the colors of these gases and the nature of dichromacy.

1. **Chlorine Gas**: Chlorine gas appears as a pale yellow-green color.
2. **Neon Gas**: Neon gas, when excited, emits a bright red-orange color.

Dichromacy is a form of color blindness where an individual has only two types of functional color receptors (cones) instead of the usual three. This can affect the ability to distinguish certain colors, particularly those that rely on the missing or malfunctioning cone. However, the difference between a pale yellow-green and a bright red-orange is quite significant. The brightness and hue differences are substantial enough that even a dichromat would likely be able to distinguish between the two.

Therefore, a dichromat would probably be able to easily distinguish chlorine gas from neon gas.

The correct answer is:
(A) Yes"
"A: No

Elizabeth I of England, who reigned from 1558 to 1603, was a patron of the arts and theater. However, ""Dido, Queen of Carthage"" by Christopher Marlowe was likely written in the early 1590s and first published in 1594. There is no historical evidence to suggest that Elizabeth I attended a performance of this play. Given the limited public nature of theater during her reign and her royal status, it is highly unlikely that she saw ""Dido, Queen of Carthage."""

Q: Are sea turtles enjoying life during quarantine?

A: While we can't directly ask sea turtles how they feel, the reduced human activity during quarantine has generally had a positive impact on their environment. With fewer people on beaches and less pollution in the oceans, sea turtles have faced fewer disturbances and threats. This can lead to better nesting conditions and cleaner waters, which are beneficial for their survival and well-being.

So, in a way, the reduced human impact can be seen as creating a more favorable environment for sea turtles.

Lactobacillus bacteria are not necessary for making all types of pickles. While they are essential for fermented pickles, where they convert sugars into lactic acid, creating a tangy flavor and preserving the cucumbers, many pickles are made using a vinegar-based brine.

**Q: Would a person with Anorexia Nervosa be more likely to break a bone than a regular person?**

**A:**
(B) Yes

People with Anorexia Nervosa are at a higher risk of breaking bones due to several factors:

1. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Anorexia often leads to a severe lack of essential nutrients, including calcium and vitamin D, which are crucial for bone health.
2. **Hormonal Imbalances**: The disorder can cause hormonal changes, such as low estrogen levels in women and low testosterone levels in men, which can weaken bones.
3. **Osteoporosis**: Chronic anorexia can result in osteoporosis, a condition characterized by low bone density and increased fragility, making bones more prone to fractures.
4. **Delayed Bone Development**: In younger individuals, anorexia can interfere with the normal development of bone mass, leading to weaker bones and a higher risk of fractures.

Therefore, individuals with Anorexia Nervosa are more likely to experience bone fractures compared to those without the disorder."

1. **Goofy's Creator**: Goofy, the iconic Disney character, was created by Art Babbitt, an animator at Walt Disney Productions.

2. **Employer**: Art Babbitt's employer was Walt Disney, the founder of the Walt Disney Company.

3. **Brother of Walt Disney**: Walt Disney's brother was Roy O. Disney, who was also a co-founder of the Walt Disney Company and played a crucial role in its business operations.

4. **Excommunicable Offense**: An excommunicable offense is a serious sin that can result in excommunication from the Catholic Church, such as heresy, schism, or apostasy.

After reviewing the historical context and available information, there is no evidence to suggest that Roy O. Disney committed an excommunicable offense. Roy O. Disney is known for his contributions to the business and success of the Walt Disney Company, but there are no records of him being involved in any actions that would lead to excommunication from the Catholic Church.

To determine if a football field can fit on Alcatraz Island, we need to compare the dimensions of a standard football field with the available space on the island.

A standard American football field is 120 yards long (100 yards for the playing field plus 10 yards for each end zone) and 53.3 yards wide, which is approximately 360 feet by 160 feet.

Alcatraz Island has an area of about 22 acres, which is approximately 97,000 square meters or 1,044,000 square feet. The island is roughly circular with a diameter of about 500 feet.

While the island's diameter is larger than the length of a football field, and the total area is more than sufficient to accommodate a football field, the terrain of Alcatraz is rocky and uneven, and much of the island is occupied by buildings and other structures. This makes it impractical to actually place a football field there without significant modifications.

Therefore, the answer is:
(A) No, it is not practical to fit a football field on Alcatraz Island due to the terrain and existing structures."

Iris and Hermes, while both adept at communication and swift travel in their mythological roles, would likely face several challenges in a modern UPS job:

1. **Technology Adaptation**: Modern delivery jobs require proficiency with technology, such as GPS, digital tracking systems, and electronic signature devices. Both Iris and Hermes would need to learn and adapt to these tools, which are far removed from their ancient experiences.

2. **Physical Demands**: UPS jobs often involve heavy lifting, long hours of driving, and physical labor. While Hermes is known for his speed and agility, and Iris for her swift travel, the repetitive and physically demanding nature of the job might be a new and challenging experience for them.

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Modern logistics and delivery services have strict regulations and procedures. Both deities would need to understand and follow these rules, which might be unfamiliar to them.

4. **Customer Service**: Interacting with a diverse range of customers, some of whom might be impatient or difficult, could be a challenge. While Hermes is known for his charm and social skills, Iris might find it more difficult to navigate these interactions, as she is less associated with human interactions in mythology.

5. **Teamwork and Coordination**: Working in a team environment and coordinating with other drivers, sorters, and managers would be a new experience for both, as they are used to operating independently or with divine authority.

Given these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that Iris and Hermes would struggle with the modern demands of a UPS job."

Lactic acid is a natural substance produced in the body, especially during intense physical activity when the muscles require more energy than the oxygen supply can provide. While the buildup of lactic acid can lead to muscle fatigue and a burning sensation, it is not inherently bad. In fact, lactic acid plays several important roles:

1. **Energy Source**: It can be used by the muscles and the heart as an energy source.
2. **Adaptation Signal**: It signals the body to adapt, improving its ability to handle and clear lactate, which can enhance endurance and performance.
3. **pH Buffer**: It helps maintain the pH balance in muscles, preventing a rapid drop in pH that could impair muscle function.

So, having lactic acid in your body is a normal and often beneficial part of your metabolic processes."

**Q: Can binary numbers and the standard alphabet satisfy criteria for a strong password?**

**A: (A) Yes**

Binary numbers (0 and 1) and the standard alphabet (A-Z and a-z) can indeed satisfy the criteria for a strong password. A strong password typically includes:

1. **Length**: The longer the password, the more secure it is.
2. **Complexity**: A mix of different types of characters, such as uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
3. **Unpredictability**: Avoiding common words, phrases, or easily guessable patterns.

### Using Binary Numbers and the Standard Alphabet:
- **Binary Numbers (0 and 1)**: While binary numbers alone are limited, they can add to the complexity when combined with other characters.
- **Standard Alphabet (A-Z and a-z)**: The standard alphabet provides 52 characters (26 uppercase and 26 lowercase), which can significantly increase the complexity of a password.

### Example:
- A password like `101010AaBbCc1100` is 16 characters long, includes both uppercase and lowercase letters, and binary numbers. This combination makes the password more complex and harder to guess.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Special Characters**: Adding special characters (e.g., `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, etc.) can further enhance the strength of the password.
- **Randomness**: Ensuring the password is random and not based on common patterns or words is crucial for security.

In conclusion, binary numbers and the standard alphabet, when used together, can create a strong and secure password."

Q: Can Roman numerals fill the normal number of Sudoku box options?
A:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The correct answer is (B) No.

Sudoku is a puzzle that requires filling a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. Roman numerals, which use letters like I, V, X, L, C, D, and M, do not fit this requirement. They are not a set of unique, single-character symbols that can easily represent the digits 1 through 9. Therefore, using Roman numerals would not work for a standard Sudoku puzzle."

Q: Are pancakes a bad snack for cats?

A: (B) Yes

Pancakes are not a good snack for cats. Here’s why:

1. **High Carbohydrate Content:** Pancakes are rich in carbohydrates, which can lead to weight gain and other health issues in cats.
2. **Dairy Content:** Many pancake recipes include milk or other dairy products, which can cause digestive problems in cats, as many adult cats are lactose intolerant.
3. **Added Sugars and Flavors:** Pancakes often contain added sugars and flavors that can be harmful to cats and may cause digestive issues.
4. **Lack of Nutritional Value:** Cats need a diet high in protein and specific nutrients, and pancakes do not provide these essential elements.

It's best to stick to cat-specific treats or foods that are formulated to meet their nutritional needs. If you want to give your cat a special treat, consider small pieces of cooked chicken or specialized cat treats."

White rice and sesame seeds have different storage properties and potential for spoilage. White rice, when stored properly, can last for a long time without going rancid. It is more susceptible to pest infestations or moisture absorption, which can lead to mold, rather than rancidity.

Sesame seeds, however, contain oils that can oxidize and become rancid over time, especially if not stored properly. This rancidity is due to the breakdown of the oils, which can result in off-flavors and odors. To prevent this, sesame seeds should be stored in a cool, dry place, and it is often recommended to keep them in the refrigerator or freezer.

Therefore, sesame seeds are more likely to go rancid before white rice.

The correct answer is (B) No."

"To determine if a 500GB USB device is enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, we need to consider the average file size of Netflix content based on different streaming qualities:

1. **Streaming Qualities and File Sizes:**
   - **SD (Standard Definition):** Approximately 0.35GB to 0.7GB per hour.
   - **HD (High Definition):** Approximately 0.7GB to 1.5GB per hour.
   - **UHD (Ultra High Definition):** Approximately 3GB to 7GB per hour.

2. **Calculating the Total Storage Needed for 10 Hours a Day:**
   - **SD:** 10 hours/day * 0.35GB/hour = 3.5GB/day (minimum) to 10 hours/day * 0.7GB/hour = 7GB/day (maximum).
   - **HD:** 10 hours/day * 0.7GB/hour = 7GB/day (minimum) to 10 hours/day * 1.5GB/hour = 15GB/day (maximum).
   - **UHD:** 10 hours/day * 3GB/hour = 30GB/day (minimum) to 10 hours/day * 7GB/hour = 70GB/day (maximum).

3. **Storage Capacity of 500GB USB Device:**
   - **SD:** 500GB / 3.5GB/day ≈ 143 days (minimum) to 500GB / 7GB/day ≈ 71 days (maximum).
   - **HD:** 500GB / 7GB/day ≈ 71 days (minimum) to 500GB / 15GB/day ≈ 33 days (maximum).
   - **UHD:** 500GB / 30GB/day ≈ 17 days (minimum) to 500GB / 70GB/day ≈ 7 days (maximum).

Given these calculations, a 500GB USB device is sufficient to store 10 hours of Netflix shows a day for a significant period, especially for SD and HD content. However, for UHD content, the storage will be more limited.

**Conclusion:**
- For SD and HD content, the answer is (B) Yes.
- For UHD content, the answer is (A) No.

Assuming the most common streaming quality (HD), the answer is:

Using Dustin Hoffman's Oscars as bowling pins is not a feasible idea. Here’s why:

1. **Size and Shape**: Bowling pins are designed to fit the specific dimensions of a bowling lane and to interact with the balls in a predictable way. Oscars, being much larger and differently shaped, would not fit or behave the same way.

2. **Material and Weight**: Bowling pins are made to be lightweight and durable, typically from hard maple wood or synthetic materials. Oscars, which are made of bronze and plated with 24-karat gold, are much heavier and would not function as intended in a game of bowling.

3. **Practicality and Value**: Oscars are valuable and irreplaceable awards. Using them as bowling pins would be impractical and could result in significant damage or loss.

To determine whether Michael Bloomberg can fund the debt of Micronesia for a decade, let's consider the following:

1. **Michael Bloomberg's Net Worth**: As of 2023, Michael Bloomberg's net worth is estimated to be around $50-60 billion, making him one of the wealthiest individuals globally.

2. **Micronesia's Financial Situation**: Micronesia, or the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), has a relatively small economy. The country's annual budget is in the range of a few hundred million dollars, and its total external debt is also relatively modest.

3. **Feasibility**: Given Bloomberg's substantial wealth, it is technically feasible for him to cover Micronesia's debt for a decade. The financial requirements of Micronesia are significantly lower compared to Bloomberg's net worth.

4. **Willingness**: While the financial capability is there, the actual decision to fund Micronesia's debt would depend on Bloomberg's personal and strategic philanthropic goals.

Based on these points, the answer is:

(A) Yes

Michael Bloomberg has the financial capability to fund the debt of Micronesia for a decade, though the decision would ultimately depend on his personal willingness."

As a Marxist-Leninist organization, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) would not support trickle-down economics. Trickle-down economics is a capitalist theory that advocates for tax cuts and deregulation to benefit the wealthy, with the expectation that these benefits will eventually reach the broader population. This approach is fundamentally at odds with the CPSU's commitment to a planned economy and the redistribution of wealth to achieve economic equality. The CPSU's policies were designed to ensure that resources and benefits were directly allocated to the working class, rather than relying on market mechanisms to achieve social and economic goals."

Q: Would it be hard to get toilet paper if there were no loggers?

A: (B) Yes

Toilet paper is primarily made from wood pulp, which is derived from trees. Loggers play a crucial role in harvesting these trees, which are then processed into the pulp needed to manufacture toilet paper. Without loggers, the supply of wood pulp would be significantly reduced, leading to a shortage of the primary material used in toilet paper production. This would make it much harder to produce and distribute toilet paper, resulting in potential scarcity and higher prices. While there are alternative materials like recycled paper and bamboo, the existing infrastructure and supply chains for these materials are not as robust, and transitioning to them would take time and significant effort. Therefore, the absence of loggers would indeed make it difficult to get toilet paper."

Leopard seals are highly specialized marine mammals that thrive in the vast, cold waters of the Antarctic. In captivity, such as at Sea World, they face several challenges that can be hazardous to their health:

1. **Limited Space**: Leopard seals require extensive areas to swim and exhibit their natural behaviors. The confined spaces in captivity can lead to stress and physical health issues.

2. **Dietary Constraints**: Their natural diet is diverse and includes a variety of prey like fish, penguins, and other marine mammals. Replicating this diet in captivity can be difficult, potentially leading to nutritional deficiencies.

3. **Behavioral and Psychological Stress**: Leopard seals are intelligent and active animals. The lack of natural stimuli and the inability to engage in their usual behaviors can result in boredom, stress, and mental health problems.

4. **Social Dynamics**: While leopard seals are generally solitary in the wild, captivity often forces them into close quarters with other animals, which can cause stress and aggression.

These factors can significantly impact the health and well-being of leopard seals in captivity, making it hazardous for them to be kept in such environments."

"To answer this question, let's compare the heights of the three structures:

1. **Statue of Unity**:
   - Located in Gujarat, India.
   - Height: 182 meters (597 feet).

2. **Statue of Liberty**:
   - Located in New York, USA.
   - Height: 93 meters (305 feet) (excluding the pedestal, which adds 65 meters, making the total height 158 meters or 518 feet).

3. **Lighthouse of Alexandria**:
   - Located in Alexandria, Egypt.
   - Height: Estimated to be between 120 and 140 meters (394 to 459 feet).

Now, let's compare the heights:

- **Statue of Unity**: 182 meters
- **Statue of Liberty**: 93 meters (or 158 meters including the pedestal)
- **Lighthouse of Alexandria**: 120 to 140 meters

The differences in height are:
- Statue of Unity and Statue of Liberty (excluding pedestal): 182 meters - 93 meters = 89 meters
- Statue of Unity and Statue of Liberty (including pedestal): 182 meters - 158 meters = 24 meters
- Statue of Unity and Lighthouse of Alexandria: 182 meters - 120 meters = 62 meters (using the lower estimate)
- Statue of Unity and Lighthouse of Alexandria: 182 meters - 140 meters = 42 meters (using the higher estimate)

The differences are:
- Statue of Unity and Statue of Liberty (excluding pedestal): 89 meters
- Statue of Unity and Statue of Liberty (including pedestal): 24 meters
- Statue of Unity and Lighthouse of Alexandria: 42 to 62 meters

Since the difference in height between the Statue of Unity and the Lighthouse of Alexandria (42 to 62 meters) is smaller than the difference between the Statue of Unity and the Statue of Liberty (89 meters), the Statue of Unity is more level with the Lighthouse of Alexandria.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) Yes"

Reza Shah, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty in Iran, was a Sunni Muslim by birth but later converted to Shia Islam. In Shia Islam, particularly the Twelver branch, there are 12 Imams recognized as spiritual and political successors to the Prophet Muhammad. Jesus, on the other hand, is traditionally said to have had 12 disciples, known as the Twelve Apostles.

Therefore, the number of Imams recognized in Shia Islam, which Reza Shah would have followed, does not exceed the number of Jesus's disciples."

Q: Did Julio Gonzalez like acetylene?
A:
(B) Yes

Julio Gonzalez, the Spanish sculptor known for his innovative use of metal and welding techniques, often worked with acetylene in his artistic process. While we don't have direct quotes or personal accounts confirming his specific feelings, the use of acetylene in his welding and metalwork suggests that he valued its utility and likely had a positive regard for it in his artistic practice."
"Sure, let's break this down:

- ""Borgia's World of Wonders"" is a documentary series. A typical episode of a documentary series usually runs for about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
- ""Ludacris's Release Therapy"" is an album. The total runtime of a typical album is around 40 minutes to 1 hour.

Given these typical durations, it is reasonable to assume that you could watch an episode of ""Borgia's World of Wonders"" (45 minutes to 1 hour) before ""Ludacris's Release Therapy"" (40 minutes to 1 hour) finishes, especially if the episode is on the shorter side and the album is on the longer side.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) Yes"
"To address this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tiger Stadium Capacity**: Tiger Stadium, which was located in Detroit, Michigan, had a seating capacity of approximately 53,000 people.

2. **Unemployment in 1933**: During the Great Depression, particularly in 1933, the unemployment rate in the United States was around 25%. The total population of the U.S. at that time was approximately 125.6 million. Therefore, the number of unemployed people can be calculated as:
   \[
   125.6 \text{ million} \times 0.25 = 31.4 \text{ million}
   \]

Given these figures, it is evident that the number of unemployed people (31.4 million) far exceeds the capacity of Tiger Stadium (53,000).

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(A) No"

Oscar Wilde's treatment under the law would not be considered fair in the US today. In the late 19th century, Wilde was convicted of ""gross indecency"" due to his homosexual relationships, which were criminalized at the time. However, in the United States, the legal landscape has changed significantly. The Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) decriminalized consensual homosexual activity between adults, and subsequent rulings have further protected LGBTQ+ rights. Therefore, Wilde's conviction and punishment would be seen as a violation of his constitutional rights under current US law."

SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) are generally considered safe for teenagers and young adults, but they do come with specific considerations. The FDA has issued a black box warning for all antidepressants, including SSRIs, due to the increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults up to age 24, particularly during the initial stages of treatment or when doses are changed.

However, this does not mean that SSRIs are less safe for this age group. The risks are manageable with proper monitoring and care. The benefits of SSRIs in treating depression in teenagers and young adults often outweigh the potential risks. It's crucial for healthcare providers to carefully assess each patient's individual needs and to monitor them closely, especially during the early stages of treatment."

Christians generally do not anticipate an existence in Sheol after death. In Christian belief, the afterlife is primarily understood in terms of heaven and hell. Heaven is the place where the faithful will enjoy eternal life with God, while hell is the place of eternal separation from God for those who have rejected Him. Sheol, a term from the Old Testament, is more closely associated with Jewish tradition and refers to the abode of the dead. Christian teachings focus on the resurrection of the body and the soul's ultimate destination in either heaven or hell."

JAG (Judge Advocate General) has 10 seasons with a total of 227 episodes. Each episode is approximately 45 minutes long. 

To watch all episodes:
- Total viewing time: 227 episodes * 45 minutes/episode = 10,215 minutes, or about 170.25 hours.

If you have six months to watch it, that's roughly 180 days. If you watch JAG for 1 hour each day:
- 180 days * 1 hour/day = 180 hours.

Since 180 hours is more than the 170.25 hours required, it is definitely possible to watch all of JAG in six months if you watch it consistently for about 1 hour each day.

While the Sahara Desert is one of the harshest and driest environments on Earth, there are several reasons why Poland Spring could still make money there:

1. **High Demand for Water**: In such an arid region, the demand for clean, potable water is extremely high. Tourists, local residents, and travelers all need reliable sources of water.

2. **Tourism Industry**: The Sahara attracts a significant number of tourists, especially to areas like Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia. These tourists are often willing to pay a premium for bottled water, especially from well-known brands.

3. **Luxury and Premium Markets**: High-end resorts, hotels, and safari camps often cater to wealthy tourists who are willing to pay for premium products, including branded bottled water.

The Samsung Galaxy A10e has a base storage capacity of 32GB, which can be expanded up to 512GB using a microSD card. However, storing every HD episode of Game of Thrones would require a significant amount of storage. Each episode in HD quality can take up around 1GB to 2GB of space. With 73 episodes in total, you would need approximately 73GB to 146GB of storage. Even with the maximum storage expansion, this would leave very little room for other apps, data, and the operating system, making the device impractical for everyday use. Therefore, it is not feasible to save every HD episode of Game of Thrones on a Samsung Galaxy A10e."

Q: Is Cambodia too expensive for the 2020 richest billionaire to own?

A: (B) No

While the concept of an individual ""owning"" a country is not legally or practically feasible, it's worth noting that the richest person in 2020, Jeff Bezos, had a net worth of around $180 billion. The GDP of Cambodia in 2020 was approximately $27.5 billion. Even though Bezos's wealth far exceeds Cambodia's GDP, the idea of ""owning"" a sovereign nation is not a matter of financial capability but of legal and ethical boundaries. Therefore, the answer is No."

To answer the question, we need to compare the number of city-states in Ancient Greece with the number of states in the United States in 1900.

1. **Ancient Greece**: Ancient Greece was composed of numerous city-states, known as poleis. While the exact number varied, it is estimated that there were around 1,000 to 1,500 city-states during the height of Greek civilization. These city-states were often independent and had their own governments and laws.

2. **United States in 1900**: By 1900, the United States had 45 states. This number reflects the states that had been admitted to the Union by that time.

Given these numbers, the number of city-states in Ancient Greece (1,000 to 1,500) is significantly higher than the 45 states in the United States in 1900.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Having lip piercings can potentially lead to more expensive dental bills. Here’s why:

1. **Tooth Damage**: The jewelry can cause chipping or cracking of teeth, especially if it frequently comes into contact with them.
2. **Gum Irritation**: The piercing can irritate the gums, leading to gum recession, which can expose tooth roots and increase the risk of decay and sensitivity.

Q: Was Harry Potter a better investment than The Matrix for Warner Bros.?

A: (B) Yes

**Explanation:**

- **Financial Success:**
  - **Harry Potter:** The Harry Potter film series, consisting of eight movies, has grossed over $7.7 billion worldwide. This massive financial success is complemented by extensive merchandise, theme park attractions, and spin-offs like the ""Fantastic Beasts"" series.
  - **The Matrix:** The Matrix franchise, with four films, has grossed over $1.6 billion worldwide. While significant, this is considerably less than the Harry Potter series.

- **Cultural Impact:**
  - **Harry Potter:** The Harry Potter franchise has a global fan base and has become a cultural phenomenon, influencing literature, film, and entertainment. It has sustained revenue over many years through various media and merchandise.
  - **The Matrix:** The Matrix is highly influential in the science fiction and action genres, with a strong cult following. However, its cultural impact and revenue streams are not as extensive or long-lasting as those of Harry Potter.

- **Longevity and Diversification:**
  - **Harry Potter:** The franchise has maintained its relevance and profitability over decades, with new content and attractions continuing to draw audiences.
  - **The Matrix:** While the franchise has had a significant impact, its longevity and diversification into other media are more limited compared to Harry Potter.

Given these factors, Harry Potter has been a more substantial and consistent financial investment for Warner Bros."

Creating a jet plane is an incredibly complex endeavor that requires a vast array of resources, specialized knowledge, and advanced technology. Here’s why it cannot be done without society:

1. **Specialized Knowledge and Expertise**: Building a jet plane involves a team of experts in various fields such as aerodynamics, materials science, mechanical engineering, and avionics. This level of expertise is developed and maintained through formal education and professional training, which are integral parts of a structured society.

2. **Advanced Technology and Tools**: The design and manufacturing processes for a jet plane rely on sophisticated tools and technologies, including computer-aided design (CAD) software, precision manufacturing equipment, and advanced testing facilities. These technologies are the result of extensive research and development, often supported by large institutions and industries.

3. **High-Tech Materials**: Jet planes are constructed using a variety of advanced materials, such as lightweight alloys, composites, and specialized electronic components. These materials are produced in specialized facilities and are not readily available outside of an industrialized society.

4. **Infrastructure and Support Systems**: The development and testing of a jet plane require significant infrastructure, including runways, hangars, and maintenance facilities. Additionally, regulatory bodies and safety standards ensure that the plane meets stringent safety and performance criteria, which are established and enforced by society.

5. **Economic and Financial Support**: The cost of developing and producing a jet plane is enormous, often running into billions of dollars. This level of investment is typically provided by governments, corporations, or a combination of both, and is not feasible for an individual or a small group operating outside of a structured society.

In conclusion, the creation of a jet plane is a collective effort that relies on the infrastructure, resources, and expertise provided by a developed society. Therefore, it is not possible to build a jet plane without society."

In feudal Japan, peasants, often referred to as ""hyakushō,"" had more rights and freedoms compared to serfs in medieval England. However, this does not mean they had a universally higher status. 

In medieval England, serfs were bound to the land and had limited personal freedoms. They were required to provide labor to their lord, pay various dues, and had little to no legal rights. They could not leave the land without the lord's permission and were subject to the lord's jurisdiction.

In feudal Japan, peasants were not bound to the land in the same way. They could move more freely, and while they were required to pay taxes to the local daimyo (feudal lord), they had more control over their own lives and could own property. Peasants in Japan were part of a more defined social hierarchy, which included samurai, artisans, and merchants, and they were generally considered to be above the merchant class in status.

However, the conditions for peasants in Japan varied widely depending on the region and the policies of the local daimyo. Some daimyo were more benevolent than others, and the lives of peasants could be quite different from one domain to another.

In summary, while Japanese peasants had more rights and freedoms, the social and legal systems of the two societies were quite different, and it is not accurate to say that Japanese peasants had a universally higher status than English serfs."
"To answer this question, let's look at the historical positions of both Andrew Johnson and Elagabalus.

"To determine whether a cheetah can generate enough force to topple Big Show, we need to consider the physical attributes of both the cheetah and Big Show.

1. **Cheetah's Physical Capabilities**:
   - Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds up to 70 miles per hour (112 kilometers per hour).
   - However, their strength is not as impressive as their speed. Cheetahs are built for agility and quick bursts of speed, not for generating significant force or toppling large objects.

2. **Big Show's Physical Attributes**:
   - Big Show, a professional wrestler, stands at 7 feet 1 inch (2.16 meters) tall and weighs around 383 pounds (174 kg).
   - He is known for his immense size and strength, which are further enhanced by his training in professional wrestling.

Given these factors, a cheetah, despite its speed and agility, would not have the physical strength or the leverage necessary to topple Big Show. Big Show's size and strength would provide significant resistance, making it highly unlikely for a cheetah to achieve this.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(A) No"
"(A) No

The name ""Marco Polo"" is indeed associated with a popular game played in swimming pools, where one person shouts ""Marco"" and others respond with ""Polo."" However, this is a modern recreational activity and not something that would be commonly heard near water in a general sense. Therefore, the correct answer is ""No."""
"(A) No

Citrus plants require a warm, subtropical climate to thrive. Ulaanbaatar, with its cold and harsh winters, does not provide the necessary conditions for citrus to grow naturally. The average temperatures in Ulaanbaatar are well below what citrus plants need to survive and flourish. Therefore, citrus plants are not suitable for growing in Ulaanbaatar without specialized protection like a greenhouse."
"A: No

Frogs do not experience complex emotions like disgust. Their behaviors are primarily driven by instinct and basic survival needs, rather than the cognitive and emotional processes that underlie human feelings such as disgust."
"(A) No

Woodrow Wilson, despite his mixed record on race relations, would likely not have supported the Plessy v. Ferguson decision. While he implemented segregationist policies in federal offices during his presidency, his background as a scholar and his broader philosophical views suggest a critical stance toward the ""separate but equal"" doctrine. The Plessy v. Ferguson decision upheld racial segregation, which Wilson, in his academic writings and some of his more progressive views, might have found problematic. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) No."

King Arthur, a legendary figure from the late 5th and early 6th centuries, could not have been present at the beheading of Anne Boleyn, which occurred on May 19, 1536. The time difference of about 1000 years makes it impossible for him to have been there."
"(A) Yes

A paraplegic individual can certainly be suitable for conducting an orchestra. Conducting primarily involves the upper body, using gestures and a baton to guide the musicians. The role also requires a deep understanding of music, the ability to interpret scores, and the skill to lead and coordinate the ensemble. These essential aspects of conducting are not hindered by physical limitations in the lower body. Many accomplished musicians and conductors have overcome various challenges to excel in their field, demonstrating that physical ability is not the only factor in determining suitability for this role."
"B: Yes

Tenzing Norgay, with his extensive experience and expertise in mountaineering, including his historic ascent of Mount Everest, would find Snowdon, the highest peak in Wales, to be a relatively easy climb. Given his skills and the significantly lower elevation of Snowdon compared to Everest, it would indeed be a piece of cake for him."
"To address this question, let's break it down:

Javier Sotomayor holds the men's world record in the high jump with a leap of 2.45 meters (8 feet 0.46 inches), set in 1993.

Bengal cats are known for their exceptional agility and jumping ability. On average, a Bengal cat can jump 3 to 4 times their body length. Given that the average height of a Bengal cat is around 15 to 20 inches (0.38 to 0.51 meters), this translates to a vertical jump of approximately 1.14 to 1.53 meters (3.74 to 5.02 feet).

Given these figures, it is clear that even the most athletic Bengal cat would not be able to jump 2.45 meters, which is the height of Sotomayor's record.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) No"

Retail jobs, while accessible to many, are not suited for everyone. Here’s why:

1. **Customer Service**: Retail roles often require excellent customer service skills, including the ability to handle difficult customers with patience and professionalism.
2. **Communication**: Effective communication is essential for explaining products, resolving issues, and collaborating with team members.
3. **Problem-Solving**: Retail employees frequently need to address customer complaints and find practical solutions.
4. **Physical Demands**: Many retail jobs involve standing for long periods, lifting items, and working in a fast-paced environment.
5. **Flexibility**: Retail schedules can be irregular, including evenings, weekends, and holidays, which may not fit everyone's personal or family commitments.
6. **Sales Skills**: Some positions require the ability to upsell and promote products effectively.
7. **Attention to Detail**: Accuracy in tasks like cash handling, inventory management, and record-keeping is crucial.

These requirements mean that while retail can be a great fit for many, it may not align with everyone's strengths, interests, or lifestyle."
"The correct answer is (A) No.

The Battle of Actium, which took place in 31 BC, was a pivotal naval engagement between the forces of Octavian (later Augustus) and the combined fleets of Mark Antony and Cleopatra. This battle was fought using ancient war galleys and relied heavily on ramming and boarding tactics.

If the modern Brazilian Navy were to hypothetically intervene in this ancient battle, the technological disparity would be so significant that the outcome of the engagement itself would be a foregone conclusion. Modern naval forces, equipped with advanced radar, sonar, missiles, and aircraft, would easily overpower the ancient fleets. However, the question of whether the Brazilian Navy could ""turn the tide"" in a broader historical context is more nuanced.

1. **Technological Superiority**: The modern Brazilian Navy's technological superiority would ensure dominance in any direct naval confrontation. Ancient war galleys would be no match for modern frigates, submarines, and aircraft.

2. **Strategic and Political Context**: The Battle of Actium was not just a naval battle but a critical moment in the larger political and military conflict between Octavian and Mark Antony. The presence of a modern navy would fundamentally alter the strategic and political landscape. It would likely lead to different alliances, strategies, and outcomes that are difficult to predict.

3. **Historical Impact**: Introducing a modern navy into an ancient battle would have far-reaching and unpredictable effects on the historical trajectory of the Roman Empire and the Mediterranean world. The outcome of the battle would be altered, but the broader historical context and the long-term consequences would be significantly different.

Therefore, while the modern Brazilian Navy would dominate the Battle of Actium, the idea of ""turning the tide"" in a meaningful historical sense is more complex. The correct answer is (A) No, because the introduction of such a force would fundamentally change the context and outcomes of the conflict in ways that go beyond the scope of a single battle."
